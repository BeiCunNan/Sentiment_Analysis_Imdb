Ron Howard used this movie in an attempt to give his old friend from Happy Days, Henry Winkler, a leg up in the movie business, and gave one to Michael Keaton instead.<br /><br />Keaton steals this movie with a wonderful performance as a self-styled 'idea man', setting up a pimping business out of the city morgue with the financial help of Winkler who falls for one of the prostitutes in the form of Shelley Long, who has certainly been better cast.<br /><br />Almost everything Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel have ever written has been brilliant, we'll ignore the City Slickers sequel and The Flinstones, and this is one of their early movies which, while still hilarious, somehow didn't do that well at the box-office.<br /><br />Good direction from Howard, good performances from the stars and supporting cast, and a wonderful script, make this a brilliant movie, and shows why Keaton can be such a comedic star.
