a very ridiculous movie. but lucky for the movie i love laughing at movies whether when it's meant to or not. The "rampage" scene, which made made him go into the doctor's, set me over the edge. I was having just regular fun with the movie saying o my god and chuckling at times but during the rampage, i almost fell outa my chair laughing. The guy tried so hard to make the audience believe he was crazy and my god did he fail haha if you never wanna watch that whole i wouldn't blame you. but in case you ever do stumble on it, just at least fast forward to that scene i promise you won't be disappointed. well i don't wanna give out any spoilers of the movie so i recommend it only if you're looking to have fun with it. Garbage Day!!
