I first heard of WWHTKB from a friend of mine who appeared in the film. No longer an actor, my friend discouraged me from watching the film (he doesn't think he looks good on film), but my curiosity got the better of me and I ordered a copy from the website. Boy, am I glad I did.<br /><br />WWHTKB is a quirky romp, filled with bizarre characters that are only a step removed from the outlandish slackers that everyone in our generation has encountered/been/hated/hung out with/slept with at some point or another. The strangely Byzantine plot doesn't take itself too seriously, and writer/director John-Paul Nickel takes the opportunity to send up romantic comedies and Indy films alike, while making a movie that is arguably both. The performances are compelling: whiny Gregory Caridi as Eugene holds the thing together with a repellent charm; the dynamic duo of John Yost and Greg Johnstone (as Stanley and Quentin, respectively) always entertain; Kristin Pfeifer as the titular "Bitch" is so outlandishly evil you can't help but laugh; and then there's Jason Steele--his performance as George is something to behold.<br /><br />Is the film perfect? Of course not. It's a bit derivative in style, stealing from (or paying homage to?) Kevin Smith and Christopher Guest, among others. When you get past the clever wordplay and eccentric characters, the plot is rather mundane. There are some technical problems--the sound, particularly, is spotty in places. But it's still more than worth watching. Writer/director John-Paul Nickel does a hell of a job on his first film, and shows that, given some practice (and maybe a budget), he could one day be a force to behold.<br /><br />Kudos to the Five Cent Productions gang. Keep 'em coming!
