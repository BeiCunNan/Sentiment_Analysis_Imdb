Sometimes, the movie business can be a sick, sick venture. No, that's the the point of this painfully lame ego-fest about a recent film school grad who has troubles with life and celluloid. That's the impression you get after viewing this self-important bundle of cliches that is as tired as it is arrogant. After all, it's a mystery of epic proportions that something this bad could ever get produced.<br /><br />I'm not so sure what's more offensive, the film's constant use of soft focus, or the fact that most porns have better acting, better dialogue, and more suspenseful plots.<br /><br />David the filmmaker wants a girl. She wants stability. His responsible (read: bad) friend tries to swiper her away. Along the way, we learn that it's better to be a navel-gazing spewer of trite truths and drop casual and ineffective references to "Star Wars" and "A Few Good Men" because, gosh, those are movies no one thought to spoof. It reeks of "I just watched 'Good Will Hunting,' and now I want to be a screenwriter!"
