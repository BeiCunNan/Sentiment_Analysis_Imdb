I've seen plenty of nanny from hell flicks but this movie is sort of the librarian from hell. I couldn't figure out if I wanted to sleep with her or take a bat and bludgeon her to death. The actress that played Erin really got under my skin. Although I would have liked to seen her naked or someone in the film take their clothes off, but it is what it is. The scene where she really freaks me out is where she's looking out a window or something, looking all insane and spaced out. The dude who played the cop was a bit over the top but the rest of the lead actors were actually pretty damn good. The other thing that I thought was freaky was the little kid's nursery rhymes and as the movie goes on, you realize that these have double meanings for all the murders which is pretty cool. I also liked how they filmed everything with the color red. Low budget and flawed but really dig the style.
