I just wanted to let some of the negative posting people about the movie Indigo on here know that the movie was mostly made for the Indigo children, not necessarily for the rest of us. These children have sent many emails and letters to the three people responsible for this movie thanking them and expressing their utmost gratitude to them for bringing such a movie to the populous. Most of these children are misunderstood and they need proper attention and handling. Also, if you go to the indigothemovie website, you will find actual letters from these children that show this is a legitimate race of entities incarnating in mass numbers on this planet to help raise Earth's vibration and individuals as well. Namaste, gariadea
