Drama's and movies are for entertainment primarily I believe. In that sense, this drama is a top ten feature. The acting is superb. The budget for this making is clearly very low yet the (only indoor) scenery is absolutely acceptable. One may feel cramped occasionally due to the strict indoor shots. But the storyline is intriguing and captivated me. Added to that, the Roman empire has a certain magic flair.<br /><br />'I Claudius' is a single-season-13-episode drama of the rise and fall of many Roman Emperors, according to Claudius' memory. Claudius is the last Roman Emperor but whether this is a victory for this (good) man is debatable. See for yourself to find out. Also, 'I Claudius' is the one and only drama ever broad-casted in every single nation in the world.<br /><br />The bad side is the historical accuracy: almost none. It's missing too many relevant and interesting aspects of the political culture in those days. If the intention of this drama was to educate me then I wouldn't have been very pleased. But education wasn't the purpose of the director at all so no problem as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />I'll give it 9 stars. I motivate it like this: Entertainment Value counts triple. 10 for Entertainment, 5 for accuracy. 10*3 + 5 = 35. 35/4 = 8.75. No eight-three-quarter star exist so I round it up to 9 stars.
