This is a truly terrible movie.<br /><br />In most suspense films one is asked to"suspend disbelief" at some moment in order for the film to continue to entertain and keep you involved. In "16 Blocks" you are asked to suspend disbelief in the first 10 minutes of the film, regarding the basic premise of the movie. I found the premise and the execution of the plot of the film to be an imposition upon me, my time, and my money. It is poor movie of the week TV fare.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is so obviously an alcoholic mess from the start that I shudder at the thought that the "blue wall" of police solidarity would close around him even for a moment. It is a shame that David Morse, an admirable actor in so many ways, is stuck in this mess.<br /><br />Why don't movies come with a money back guarantee. This one certainly should.
