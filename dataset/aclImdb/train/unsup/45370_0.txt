"Full Frontal" is the ultimate exercise in Hollywood masturbation. It's a movie . within a movie . WITHIN A MOVIE. Is this clever, or merely solipsistic? If you've seen any of Soderbergh's better films, I'd recommend you stick to those and avoid this one. Among the many detracting points, the lighting is terrible (half of the film is shot on digital video . with lower production values than many of your own home movies), and the cast seems to know that it's all an in joke. Ha ha! Hollywood is soulless!! But who gives a damn? There's no way into this film. None of the characters are worth identifying with. even after you are allowed to realize that half of them are merely characters in ANOTHER movie ABOUT a movie. Jesus. are there really no new ideas? Is the next Soderbergh film going to be about the bowel movements of Hollywood heavyweights? Skip it and rent `Traffic' again.
