Days is on the block to be canceled in 2009. There is an online petition to stop this from happening. Please sign it and send it to any days fans or just anyone who would sign it for you. the site is http://ipetitions/petition/123679. I need to say more to post this very important message. I am so glad John is back. I cried and cried when he episodes of him dying were on. I was depressed. I think that Shawn and Chloe hanging out will be a bad idea. I am a big EJ fan, but I like Lucas as well. I've been watching the show since 1987. I remember when Steve and Kayla got married and she got her voice back just in time to say her wedding vows. The best storyline was who killed Nick? It ended up being Jo, Steve's mom, but it was a great story if anyone else remembers it. Thank you
