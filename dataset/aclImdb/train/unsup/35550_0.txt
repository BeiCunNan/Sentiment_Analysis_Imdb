I can't believe a film with this much talent can be a total waste, but if you can't understand the dialog for the heavy Irish accents, you can't appreciate where they are trying to take you.<br /><br />I gave it over an hour and without being pulled into the story, I could only see a lot of bizarre behavior.<br /><br />I walked out to avoid further pain. I wasn't the only one to leave early.<br /><br />Cinematography, locations, were acceptable, but not enough to pull it out for me.<br /><br />I will try to see other productions of Film Board of Ireland, but only after establishing that an educated American adult will have no difficulty recognizing the language.
