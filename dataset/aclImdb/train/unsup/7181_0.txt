This film has always been much more than it's plot. The tale of a poor boy who begins to care for a injured animal. The young boy's surroundings are not very desirable. His mother is disappointed by his selfishness. His teacher is disappointed at his lack of work ethic. In his neighborhood he is chased by the local bullies. And yet out of this chaos he finds joy and pride in caring for a beaten up old alley cat. I suspect this film will mean more to those who love animals and feel the joy when helping a poor creature that needs help. It is true that the climax is quite sad, but it seems to fit the story. And it never takes away from the message that people can find great joy in loving and caring for animals. I have always felt that this characteristic was one of the best parts of mankind.
