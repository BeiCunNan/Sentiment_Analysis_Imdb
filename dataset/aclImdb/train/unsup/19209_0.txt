This film has a great cast of super stars, Humphrey Bogart(Dist.Atty.Martin Ferguson)"The Caine Mutiny"'54 who wears a bow-tie and was in the prime of his acting career which ended in 1957. He had great supporting actors namely: Zero Mostel (Big Babe Lazich) "Fiddler On The Roof"'64; Everett Sloane(Albert Mendoza) "Somebody Up There Likes Me" '56'; Jack Lambert (Tom Zaca) "Riverboat'59" TV Series '59-'61 who played gangster and hoodlum roles in Western's for many years. Tito Vuolo(Tony Vetto) was the top gangster who gave Martin Ferguson a hard time.
