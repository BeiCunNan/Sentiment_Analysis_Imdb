I see all the high marks and the claims of being scary this film gets from people and I wonder if I just finished watching the same movie. Other than the evil daughter, whose performance I enjoyed, the acting in this flick is SOOOOOO over the top it's laughable. I found the mom's performance painful to watch, as well as the grieving, drunkard mom of the drowned boy. I will say that the story was intriguing, and I put up with the rotten acting to see it through, but it was hardly scary, and to compare it to the Exorcist as some posters have done is nuts. Campy best explains the mood of this flick. Plus it is WAY TOO LONG! This story could have been a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode with no trouble at all. <br /><br />I guess it was easy for the girl to be so evil and cunning, growing up in a house with NO Dad, a ham for a mom, a janitor with a weird southern accent, and most of all an extremely annoying wanna-be psychologist as a landlady.
