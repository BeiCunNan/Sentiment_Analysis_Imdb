There was no 'Surf 1', but this 'sequel' about the marketing of a unique soft drink is OK if taken as a 90-minute snack-food flick.<br /><br />No discernible logic exists in the movie, but it doesn't really matter as viewers who last past the first 5 minutes won't care anyway.<br /><br />The best of the actors includes Ruth Buzzi as a surfer's Mom, Lyle Waggoner as policeman 'Chief Boyardie', and Peter Isacksen as science teacher 'Mr. Beaker'. The supporting cast is not particularly worth mentioning, but there are lots of topless chicks to be found and that's never a bad thing.<br /><br />There are some gross 'food-eating' scenes and a wave of cool surfing, add to it a little Oingo Boingo, and you're all set. This movie may have the brains of a bag of potato chips, but it's not half bad.<br /><br />Still waiting for 'Surf 3'.
