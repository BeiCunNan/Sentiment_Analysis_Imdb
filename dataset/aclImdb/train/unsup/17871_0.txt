IDENTITY is a very good idea how a horror thriller should be done. It achieves very much suspense from the beginning till the end. There are many puzzles to solve but it keeps you anyway asking if there is a logic for all these victims. Here is perhaps the weak point of the movie but hey it is just a movie and that must not be always a realistic one. If you have enough fantasy and imagination you can enjoy it. I think the director developed the story deep enough or too much. Perhaps some scenes could have been deleted. I have to admit that there was a surprisingly end that lets even open for a sequel. Picture was well done. I warn you there are many bloody scenes and much violence and is not an usual thriller. Rating: 6.75/10.<br /><br />Films to recommend in this genre are no doubt the both FINAL DESTINATION, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER or JOY RIDE.
