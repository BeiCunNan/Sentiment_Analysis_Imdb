I'm watching this movie as I'm writing these comments. Anyone who has experienced tragic loss can identify with one of the characters. Kate Nelligan projects a range of emotions and frustration seldom seen outside of theater. Kudos to the writers for characters that can't be forgotten. You can't watch this movie without be haunted by the location, the music, and the story.
