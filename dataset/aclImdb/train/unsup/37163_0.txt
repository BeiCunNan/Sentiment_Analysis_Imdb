Horrible CGI, horrible effects, and horrible acting. When I first saw the raptors, I was immediately reminded of Turok. When the raptors got shot, I was reminded of horribly crude video game violence and paintball combined, and then their wounds magically disappeared. When a guy got eaten, their bodies became puddles of blood and a few clothing fragments... no bones, no organs, no nothing. And they sounded like the lions in Zoo Tycoon.<br /><br />Another thing I hoped was that they would make the raptors smarter than this... when hunting, they stood there and watched the people as they fired at them.<br /><br />Dinosaur fans and raptor fans... go watch JP instead. A 4/10 movie.
