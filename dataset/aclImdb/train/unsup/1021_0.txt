I haven't watched that many "Nunsploitation" films, but the ones I did were among the more prominent titles from the subgenre - Ken Russell's THE DEVILS (1971), Jess Franco's THE DEMONS (1972) and LOVE LETTERS OF A Portuguese NUN (1977), and Juan Lopez Moctezuma's ALUCARDA (1975) - and this one, though less well-known (which may be due to the fact that its prolific director had cut his teeth on lowbrow commercial stuff, including several "Santo" movies!), is just as good.<br /><br />Hilariously, the production company which made it is called Hollywood Films and finance was provided by the "Promocion Turistica Mexicana" (what were they thinking?)! Despite the obvious low-budget, the quality of the cinematography (including its color scheme and the moody lighting) is very adequate - if not exactly smooth! The score, too, is notable in its schizophrenia: lively pop and electronic sounds (as in the rather silly orgy at the end, in which some of the bawdy nuns were actually played by prostitutes hired expressly for this one scene!) alternating with pastoral/lyrical sections and the occasional reverent passage inside the convent.<br /><br />The film, unfortunately, badly lacks pace and several shots run longer than is necessary - apart from it being somewhat repetitive (particularly during the possessed nun's sex-and-death rampage and her subsequent attempts to cover her tracks, which scenes may have influenced the first half of THE ANTICHRIST [1974]; SATANICO PANDEMONIUM itself was partly inspired by Matthew Lewis' celebrated novel THE MONK - which Luis Bunuel, friend of the director and my personal favorite film-maker, adapted for the screen {but didn't direct} around this same time...and which I managed to catch while in Hollywood early last January!) It is, however, galvanized by an exceptional leading performance from the statuesque (and Keira Knightley look-alike!) Cecilia Pezet.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, the film faced censorship problems with its seduction (and later sex) scenes involving a nun and an under-aged shepherd boy!; his subsequent murder at her hands, however, is extremely unconvincing. Like ALUCARDA, the film doesn't dwell on period reconstruction (and, in fact, we only realize when the story actually takes place via a reference towards the end to the Inquisition); still, a few social/racial issues are raised nonetheless with the presence of the two black nuns/maids, who are mistreated even by their white 'colleagues'!<br /><br />One of its most interesting - and audacious - concepts is the way the film subverts its own intentions by pasting four endings to the narrative back-to-back: a) the girl renounces her sins and is about to allow herself to be captured by her fellow nuns; b) the Devil (campily coiffured and given to elementary conjuring tricks, but aptly incarnated by the handsome Enrique Rocha - who, at one point, even manifests himself to Pezet in the guise of a lesbian nun!) re-appearing to offer her the post of Mother Superior at the convent (the girl having conveniently murdered the current one), whereupon she discovers that her colleagues have been possessed as well, though they still end up killing her!; c) the whole story is revealed to have been merely the delusional fantasy of the main character, under shadow of death from the plague!!; and d) the devil is, however, seen to be all too real and has already set his sights on a new 'victim' at the convent.
