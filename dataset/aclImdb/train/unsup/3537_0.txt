The Best Man was a very exciting, fun, and enjoyable movie-going experience for me. As a 30 year old African American male, I thought the movie did an excellent job of exploiting the young, college-grad, working class African American. This movie has the potential to appeal to a very diverse audience of males. Conservative females probably will not like this movie that much because of the strong sexual content. However, the truths of the issues addressed were so accurately portrayed, that it shouldn't be a total lost for the conservative female. Also, the entire cast did a great job.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I most pay special homage to Terrence Dashon Howard (as Quentin). He gave a top-notched, award-deserving performance. If anybody in that movie deserves and award or any kind of special mention, it is by a long shot, Terrence. He made this movie-going experience for me that much more enjoyable. I can't wait to see what he does next. I've never been before, but I am definitely now a Terrence Dashon Howard fan. Furthermore, the entire cast was beautiful; particularly the women. I don't ever before remember seeing so many fine women on screen before at one time. Once out on video, this movie will definitely go in my video library collection.
