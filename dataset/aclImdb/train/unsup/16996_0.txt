John Travolta the star of Grease and Pulp Fiction plays the bad guy, Christian Slater is the good guy and John Woo directs. John Woo has directed allot of japan ease action films and I believe this is his American debut. The film is pretty good, and keeps you interested up until the very end.<br /><br />"Broken Arrow" is the term used to describe a nuclear device that has been lost. Major Deakins (Trovolta) is a tough U.S. Air Force pilot who is assigned to a flight mission with Captain Hale (Slater). They are to fly the B3 Stealth Bomber on war-game maneuvers over Utah loaded with two live nuclear weapons. Deakins, having been continually passed over for promotion, sells out his country and arranges to use the thermonuclear warheads under his command to blackmail the U.S. government. The only thing standing in his way is his old buddy, Captain Hale....<br /><br />Most of the time, a phenomenally silly and goofy action movie that has expertly staged action scenes (the director is John Woo, what do you expect?) but absolutely nothing to stimulate the intellect. So its another movie that you TURN-OFF your brain to watch.<br /><br />If you would rather think and watch a more plot driven film try American Beaty, Fight Club, The Usuall Suspects, The Aviator and many more.
