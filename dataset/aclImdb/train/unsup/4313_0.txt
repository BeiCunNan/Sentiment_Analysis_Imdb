I stumbled over this film on late night TV and immediately ordered the DVD. It's a corker! Fresh, invigorating, romantic, bizarre even!<br /><br />They don't make films like this in the West - and more's the pity but hence the freshness. The three lead actors are gorgeous - so it hardly matters that they must be the oldest students in town. The cinematography is beautiful - especially in the Australian sequences. The song and dance routines are as welcome as they are surprising.<br /><br />As with all Hindi films, it is pure melodrama of course. The ability to suspend one's disbelief is a necessity. But that aside, it has all the attributes of a good old fashioned Hollywood romance. Boy meets girl, boy loses girl... etc., times three.<br /><br />The core theme of friendship is a delight - as are the subtle homo-erotic overtones of Akash and Sid's relationship. Intended or not, I wouldn't have minded if they'd ended up together - but this is Bollywood remember!<br /><br />All in all, fantastic fun which I plan to watch again and again. Highly recommended.
