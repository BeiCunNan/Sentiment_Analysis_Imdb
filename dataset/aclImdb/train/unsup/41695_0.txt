I don't know what all the ravings about. If people think this is good, they should subscribe to Telemundo and watch their telenovelas, for this is surely no better. We call it soap. And some American soap has more lather. The plot is acceptable. The acting is OK, for a soap. But there is no depth. We have one brother who runs a business (which we never see). a haus frau who has little to do but talk with her gay confidant, another brother that paints sometime (we never know when) the gay confidant who does nothing but pine for one of the brothers and a mother, who has lunch, because she seems to be perpetually out to lunch. That's about all we know about these people, except when they run into each other. We know as much about the maid as we do most of them. Fine screenplay writing requires showing the characters in depth so we can appreciate their dilemmas, there challenges, their triumphs, their failures. Zoe- she likes flowers, she likes midnight swims, she likes sex but is on a Sat. night diet,( she suspects her husband is gay since he'd rather do almost anything instead of sex with her (not a bright bulb), she wants a child, she loves phallic paintings, she hates Bach, she's dangerous with a microwave. Ignacio- he says he loves his wife but seems to love men also, works a lot, is rich, loves Bach, hates moonlight swims, and as for sex, never on a Sunday... or Monday... or Tues... or Wed... or Thurs... or Friday... with a woman. Gonzalo- is a stud, is very selfish, was molested by his brother (and is still haunted by it), likes to paint phallic symbols, doesn't want to work in the rumored factory, doesn't want to get married but does want lots of sex. The mother...merely drops in for lunch and useless chatter. Wants a grandson. The Maid... knows how to make breakfast and keep her mouth shut. If one wants to make a good movie, he has to devote a lot of care to the craft. There was no depth to this. It was just slopped together.
