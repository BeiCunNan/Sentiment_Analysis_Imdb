This movie was released in 1952 so one might reasonably expect that it would have a somewhat dated, stagy story. Not the case here however. This movie has it all - an all-star cast, great acting, compelling story, wonderful cinematography and plausibility. Yes, there are people who do use other people. It is reprehensible but oh so true and this movie fully explores that seedier side of the human psyche. Lana Turner was given top billing for this movie, and her performance is wonderful, but the main star is Kirk Douglas whose performance is nothing short of spectacular. Without Mr. Douglas, this would still be a good movie, but his performance raises this movie to the level of a classic. Honorable mention must be given to Gloria Grahame, Walter Pidgeon, Gilbert Roland, Barry Sullivan, Dick Powell and the rest of the cast whose performances help make this movie a powerful and outstanding work of art.
