I have loved this movie ever since the first time I saw it years ago when I was a preteen. Although it is an old movie, it is still quite enjoyable. It was made in 1959 so of course it lacks the newer features which todays movies emit. However, I think the simple, sweet story of first love is a nice escape from the harsh realities of todays world. I always choose movies that provide something I cannot find in real life. I prefer escaping the norm. If I want to see sex and violence all I have to do is watch the news.<br /><br />Gidget takes us all back to a simpler time and place where we can relive the memories of our youth or imagine how it might have been. I not only own the video but I also watch it on television whenever it airs. Having just finished watching again, I have to say that the idea that BL was a lesbian never entered my mind. They speak about how she has it made cause she wears her boyfriends pin. I always took that to mean that she was involved in a relationship with a guy who just happened to be away at college or working a lot. Just cause someone has short hair doesn't make them a lesbian in my mind and I think the person who made that comment was way off base and didn't really follow the conversations of the movie closely.<br /><br />I love all of the Gidget movies, however to me Sandra Dee will always be the ultimate Gidget and I am sad that we have lost her recently.
