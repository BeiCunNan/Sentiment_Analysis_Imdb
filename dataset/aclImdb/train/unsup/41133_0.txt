What the hell happened to Spongebob? <br /><br />The new animation SUCKS, his new voice SUCKS and the show just isn't funny anymore.<br /><br />SB's voice is high and whiny, and the way he's drawn now is just awful. The humor used to be dark, quirky and funny. Now, it just looks like they're going through the motions.<br /><br />It looks like the whole series has jumped the shark. There's just no passion left.<br /><br />I wonder if all the original writers and animators have simply left.<br /><br />Way to go, Nickelodeon, for ruining a once great show that I've enjoyed since the very beginning. I really, really hate you guys.
