After a very promising first fifteen minutes, including a very decent and gory kill scene, this movie unfortunately what follows is a laughable mess that doesn't know if it wants to be a slasher movie, a mystery, or a cops-chase-bad guy who has nothing to do with the plot- flick! A total mess, though I do give it credit for trying to dip into different genres, but when you title your film "Drive-In Massacre," that is what you need to deliver! Not a mess like this!!
