Disappointing to say the least. Where is the old Robin, I sure miss him, and I sure as hell am not the only one. Clich√©d wedding movie with Robin as a crazy pastor who takes soon-to-be married couples through grueling challenges to see if they are worthy enough to be married in his church. Basically, an unfunny script is all the writers could muster, as the only funny bits are but two and both of them are shown in the trailers. John Krasinski is horrible in this movie, which is a shame (after seeing this movie, I almost immediately played The Office on my Tivo to forget his embarrassing and crappy performance). Mandy Moore is still Mandy Moore: Beautiful and talentless when working with lazy scripts. And Robin, poor Robin; stop appearing in these types of movies! We love you, but we hate it when you waste your talent on crap such as this. In the end, don't bother with this bland and unfunny movie, a 3/10, avoid!
