Evisceration like the sound of it? There's plenty!<br /><br />There is a scene where the sheriff and 'crypto zoologist' are in the woods - 'listen - I don't hear anything - that's what I mean, no birds, no insects, something scared them off...' <br /><br />If you listen, you can hear birds above the obvious noise of traffic from a local highway.<br /><br />Too gory for the young, too campy for the intelligent.<br /><br />Sam Raimi beware - someone is trying to bump Evil Dead from the #1 campy horror slot.<br /><br />Light hearted fun, bad acting.
