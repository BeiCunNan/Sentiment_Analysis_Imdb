Despite the interesting cast of Arthur, MacMurray and Melvyn Douglas, this film literally runs out of steam with the concocted ending it displays. Arthur marries MacMurray's business partner Douglas after the former is presumed to have drowned in an accident. Of course, a year later, MacMurray turns up alive and who shall Jean Arthur select as her husband. With the kind of ending we get, it appears that the film is a proponent of bigamy.<br /><br />We've been down this road before in movies, but let's remember that when MacMurray shows up alive, her marriage to Douglas no longer legally exists. This is conveniently forgotten.<br /><br />Douglas and MacMurray go through all sorts of silly ideas, even drawing lots to reach a conclusion.<br /><br />Advocates for group marriage shall enjoy this, give me monogany.
