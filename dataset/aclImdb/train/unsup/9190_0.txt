When watching this movie you must remember two things: First, the film director's main goal was to tape and capture the Beatles creating an album from start to finish and that they would take all the footage and edit it down. As most Beatle fans know, there was a LOT of taping going on from 3-31 Jan 1969. The second item to remember is that the director was not taping a concert, thus explaining why the video jumps around quite a bit and there are very few songs shown being performed from beginning to end. <br /><br />You can tell that the four "lads from Liverpool" really did not want to be there and were taking the easiest route to fulfilling a contract obligation. They were in fact supposed to end the film with a live concert, but this turned into the rooftop performance (which is a great bit of final energy). Many of the scenes show the Beatles very bored with being the Beatles and no longer interested in helping each other create magic in their songs. Add to all of that Yoko, who regardless of your opinion of her, the screaming and constant need for attention makes you believe that she did help split up the band.<br /><br />With all that said, it is an interesting look at how they could create wonderful music and still just goof off by playing songs they remembers from their youth. <br /><br />The Beatles are still a very popular act (even though they haven't really performed together since 1970) and this movie helps to debunk the moptop myth and shows two and a half very creative musicians creating songs still that people still enjoy listening to. You can tell from this movie why Paul McCartney still enjoys touring. It is worth watching this movie.
