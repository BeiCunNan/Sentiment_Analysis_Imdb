Funnier than all the movies from Adam Sandler Freddie Prince or David Spade! This movie has lots of laugh out loud moments that are sadly missing from todays movies! The story is simple 3 women are broke. One her husband has left her and has taken everything! Another is she is a single mother of 2! The last her husband is suing her. All friends and they are all broke. Now there going to rob the mall! This is great caper comedy! What happens is a mad cap comedy! Critics didn't like this movie! A Filmways release! Not available on Home Video for years however it returned on DVD! The movie developed a loyal following when it started running on cable! Its time for the critics to review this movie again! Jane Curtin later co-stared with Susan St James in the TV Show Kate & Allie. She also co-stared with Dabney Colemen in "Maybe Baby".
