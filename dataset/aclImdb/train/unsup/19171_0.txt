Well acted light drama with talented young and mature actors that show excellent chemistry between them.<br /><br />Robin Williams delivers an over the top (but justified) performance as the "cool" teacher that is against the rigid manners of a conservative college for rich and spoiled young men. His students love him because he teaches them to squeeze and suck the day, "carpe diem". Most of the students have little or absent right to choose what they want from life as their parents are more or less than dictators. In their philosophy class, they can dream and act they way they want and that's why they think Williams' character is a hero or something like that.<br /><br />Sadly, one of these students as any other young optimistic men follows his dream and becomes an actor against his father's will. He has the talents and the optimistic point of view but soon after he makes his debut in a play, his father punishes him the hardest way a father can do.<br /><br />Watch "Dead Poets Society" to witness how men at a young age can be very optimistic with their ideals. The movie also shows that learning methods don't necessary have to be rigid or antiquate. But the movie is truly more than that; it's a moving movie with the usual family humor.<br /><br />Great performances by Williams and Hawke who demonstrated to be a promising actor.
