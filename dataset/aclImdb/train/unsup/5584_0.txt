If you haven't checked out this show yet, then I suggest you do.<br /><br />It's a fun, light-hearted take on the whole Faustian bargain. Falling somewhere between Shaun Of The Dead and Idle Hands it's a truly like-able series. It consistently juxtaposes believable characters with fantastic scenarios. Ray Wise definitely comes out on top with his take on The Devil, anyone who remembers him from Twin Peaks will see glimpses of Leland Palmer in there, albeit a bit more over the top.<br /><br />Definitely a few plot points being dropped that suggest a deeper storyline ahead for Sam and his cronies. Can't wait to see how it pans out.<br /><br />MAKE MORE QUICKER!!!!
