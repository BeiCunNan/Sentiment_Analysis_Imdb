'Torremolinos 73' is the proof that Spanish cinema is nowadays one of the best in the world, and that Almodovar is not the only one who makes it deserve this honor. Pablo Berger is the director and this is only his second film, but the work is of a mature creator, mastering the subject, with a deep understanding of the time the plot happens, with a strong hand in directing his actors, while leaving them enough space for creativity.<br /><br />The plot happens in 1973, a moment before the fascist dictatorship in Spain fell, and Spain re-joined the family of democratic nations. A not so young couple anticipates in a way the cultural and economic revolution all Spain will go soon, by acting and producing porno movies for the Scandinavian market under the pretext of 'researching reproduction morals in different countries'. The film tells a lot about the process of transition between dictatorship and democracy and its moral risks, about the contrast between tradition and liberal morals, about the relation between pornography and art. All is done in good taste, even the soft core porno scenes are justified for a change. The actors are wonderful, they create empathy with the viewer, and they are credible as characters. <br /><br />9 out of 10 on my personal scale.
