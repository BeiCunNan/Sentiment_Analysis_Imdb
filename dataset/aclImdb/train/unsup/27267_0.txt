What can I say about this brilliant TV series? It's simply unforgettable and something to see time and time again. Top-cast actors in a stunning TV-drama, for me it ranks even higher than other classic mini-series such as 'Upstairs-Downstairs' or 'Brideshead Revisited'. The British TV has a great reputation for historical dramas, but I don't think they'll be able to top 'I, Claudius'. 10 out of 10.
