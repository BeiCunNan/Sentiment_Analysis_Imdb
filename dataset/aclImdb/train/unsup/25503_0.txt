The many efforts to recreate Jane Eyre for TV or Cinema attest to the ongoing satisfaction readers have with this author and this book. This version lifts the dialog, in many cases, word- for-word from the book, and avoids changing the storyline "for dramatic impact." As such, it is the most satisfying of all reproductions to date. The acting is excellent and the characters well- matched, dramatically. It is a relief to see the story less amputated than is necessary when confining it to a two-hour presentation.<br /><br />Negatives include: Sorcha Cusak (Jane) does not look 19 years old, Michael Jayston (Mr. Rochester) is far too handsome, and the Seventies filming style is dated, especially in the transitions from scene to scene.<br /><br />None of these objections, however, interfere with the thrill and wonder of hearing Jane Austen's own dialog, wry humor, and clever repartee brought to life by such a talented cast!
