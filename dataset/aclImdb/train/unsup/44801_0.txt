At start i want to say that i am very big fan of Lucky Luke and that he is my favorite animated and comics character. Why am i saying this? It is pretty simple. I am saying it so you can see that even hardcore fan could not love this movie.<br /><br />This should be comedy. I mean Daltons vere always funny and there are a lot of jokes with them producers could use to make this movie good western comedy about most popular cawboy. From start everything is so stupid. Everyone is scared of Daltons and people which was filming this probably though that scary faces of others and some nonsense words from some of Daltons would make me laugh. Oh no! And why not? Because all stupid words a bit of Lucky Lukes scenes and all other characters with so stupid text are wrapped together in something awful called Daltons Movie.<br /><br />Animated series about Luke are perfect, comics too but so far we haven't seen good movie so i hope that Lucky Luke (2009) will make me wrong. I really hope!
