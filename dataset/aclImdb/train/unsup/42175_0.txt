Woeful adaptation of David Williamson's sarcastic, ocker Australian play about a young Tasmanian lad who is recruited by a powerful Victorian Football League club for an unprecedented transfer fee, and then begins to send the club into turmoil with his bad attitude and shocking performances.<br /><br />Everything is so awful in this movie it's funny. None of the real life footballers (Ronny Wearmouth, Peter Daicos, Ray Shaw and Rene Kink to name a few) can act, and the lead thesps don't do much better. David Williamson fails to translate any of the dry wit of his play to the big screen and there is nothing to look at for Aussie Rules fans either. Even repetitive bursts of Mike Brady's "Up There Cazaly" (which comprises the entire soundtrack) don't help, in fact it makes things all the more unbearable.<br /><br />It's a complete mystery why a talent such as Bruce Beresford would ever get involved in a farce like this. Try watching a grand final replay in which your side loses, I guarantee you'll enjoy it more than watching "The Club".<br /><br />Sunday, July 17, 1994 - Video
