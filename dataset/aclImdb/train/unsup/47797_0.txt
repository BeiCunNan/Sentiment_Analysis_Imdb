Terrible, terrible, terrible.<br /><br />I can appreciate a good spoof, but this movie had me wincing all the way through. I'm 20 years old and I've done more professional stuff than this. Out-of-focus shots, too dark at times, terrible sound in some scenes and a REALLY annoying shifting white-balance (which means the image will change tones from one shot angle to another).<br /><br />The whole thing was filmed by handycam and looked like a porno, from the costumes, to the actresses, to the plot. Scream Bloody Murder is a porn movie minus the actual porn!<br /><br />The story was ridiculous and the ending downright stupid and nonsensical. I usually can appreciate a stupid-fun movie, but this is just way too horrible. Thank God I got to rent this for free.<br /><br />2 out of 10! And that's on the strength of the uniforms alone ;).<br /><br />Daniel
