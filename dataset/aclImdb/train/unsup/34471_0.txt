I really disliked this film. I had high hopes for it, though. The "plot" is choppy and disjointed. Most of the stories are unconnected until the end, which, normally, is a method of plot development that I enjoy. Who would continue to try to make it to a New Year's Eve party after falling backwards into a pile of doggy doo?? I wanted to leave but the others that I was with did not so I was forced to stay until the disappointing end. Janeane Garofalo's talents were seriously wasted. She is one of the funniest comedians in Hollywood today.<br /><br />There were only 2 things that I liked about the film. First, the pairing of Paul Rudd & Courtney Love was enjoyable. Their storyline was the most interesting to me, probably because they had the most intellectually stimulating conversation. Secondly, the soundtrack, an interesting compliation of early 80's pop, was quite entertaining.
