I remember a couple of years ago when IFC or Sundance was running this film on an endless loop.At first I avoided it like the plague because I'd heard so many negative things like "it's boring" Or "all they do is talk"--but then I watched it anyway and saw that the great Wallace Shawn was one of the actors.How can I not watch a movie with him in it?And the other guy-I forget his name-was the evil bishop in Ladyhawke!(I think--I could be wrong and anyway he looks just like him... If you aren't sure who W.S is remember Princess Bride? He's the little dude who tries to poison Wesley. Sure they talk their heads off in this movie but they talk about interesting things.I can't right now recall the exact tenor of the conversations but... Anyway anyone who expects at least one car crash per scene will not enjoy this movie.And no naked chicks,either.No hip hop music and no people falling down just to have someone fall down. I'm sorry to say but this movie requires a bit of intelligence and an attention span. I rate it four arty New Yowk stars!
