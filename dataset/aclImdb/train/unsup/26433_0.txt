I also saw this film at the first screening at the Seattle International Film Festival. Although I haven't seen the play, I thoroughly enjoyed the film adaptation. The story was intriguing enough with little twists and turns. The chemistry between the three main characters (played by Patricia Clarkson, Peter Sarsgaard and Campbell Scott) was wonderful. These are all fine actors and they definitely showcased their acting abilities in this film. Peter Sarsgaard was presented a special acting award by the SIFF organization before this screening and looking back at some of his previous works, I think this was well-deserved. The story might leave some unanswered questions but that's the beauty of endings that leave you asking some questions.
