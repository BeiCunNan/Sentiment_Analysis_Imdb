I have been a fan of Jane Austen's writings for some time. This adaptation of her novel is by far the best and thorough screening. I love the way Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth play their leads. I knew that after I had seen this, I had to own it!!!!! By far, one of the most romantic movies of our time. For anyone who has never seen any of the works of Jane Austen, this is a good movie to start out with. But I also feel that this is the best of all of her works. Colin Firth gained me as a loyal fan after seeing him in this movie as well as Jennifer Ehle. I look forward to seeing them again in more work. I hope they will work together again.
