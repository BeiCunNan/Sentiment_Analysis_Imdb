Ever since I was a tiny little girl, I grew up on Peanuts comic strips and cartoons. I collected the little figurines and have several Snoopy dolls, including the Snoopy Doghouse where many of my old dolls are being held in. Out of all the specials, cartoon episodes, and movies, this one has to be my all time favorites as it is my old brother's favorite.<br /><br />I don't know why I love it, but it is a very well done movie. Charlie Brown states that Snoopy is lazy and "everything (Snoopy) has is because of (Charlie)". Snoopy tries to cool off at the beach and at the Library with Chuck and Sally, but gets booted out because he's a dog. He gets into a blanket war with Linus, breaks a date on the beach with Peppermint Patty because of the "No Dogs allowed" signs and boxes with Lucy to cool off.<br /><br />Suddenly, he receives a letter from Lila, his first owner, who tells him she is in the hospital and wants him to visit her. A shocked and obviously upset Snoopy packs up, calls for Woodstock (Who makes his first appearance in the animated continued here) and heads off to meet up with her, leaving a very confused Charlie Brown holding Lila's letter.<br /><br />After lots of traveling, including an encounter with a crazy girl who tries to adopt Snoopy and Woodstock as her own pets and more of the "No Dogs Aloowed" signs, he arrives at the hospital and his presence makes Lila better. Meanwhile, Charlie Brown and the gang are worried and concerned about why Snoopy left until Linus discovers Snoopy and Lila's past connection and tells Charlie Brown about it.<br /><br />Snoopy leaves the hospital, but promises that he is going to return to live with Lila. He returns home and alerts everyone, starting with Charlie Brown, that he is going to return to Lila, who, he says in a typed letter, needs him. A farewell party is held and Snoopy receives a fond farewell and a ton of gifts before he leaves a emotionally distraught Charlie Brown and crying little Woodstock behind. But does he stay with Lila for good? You just got to watch the end to find out.<br /><br />This movie made me laugh, cry and get up and dance. It has many good points like the music and Snoopy's adventures in the wild. Even now I still get choked up at the farewell party and Chuck's sad song when Snoopy leaves home. I actually had to stop my tape once when that scene came up because I was crying so much. I laugh at all of the funny scenes like the re-occurring "No Dogs allowed" signs that appear every now and then. I still dance a bit to the scene when Snoopy and Woodstock have a little concert while they set up camp and make dinner and YES! Snoopy plays the Jaw-harp during the music break, which I love so much. "Lila's Song" and "It Changes(Charlie Brown's sad song)" are moving, "Geting it together", "Snoopy Come Home" and "We're the best of buddies (Me and You)" are fun and up beat and "At the Beach", "Fundimetally (The weird girls' song she sings to 'Rex')" and "No Dog's Allowed" are OK, but not one of my favorites.<br /><br />The only part I don't like that much is the scene with the girl that "Adopts" Snoopy and Woodstock, calls Snoopy "Rex" and stats that she'll feed him table scraps, forces him to have a tea party with her, spanks him for "spilling" tea on his "Dress", chokes him with a rope leash and drags him to a vet! This is one of the best Peanuts Movies/Specials in my opinion. It has humor, emotion, music, and great music.<br /><br />"You know what I need? I need more 'hello's'." - Charlie Brown
