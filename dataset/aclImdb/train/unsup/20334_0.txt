New mobile Report Gundam Wing: Endless WaltZ is the movie sequel to the perfect Anime. I would recommend this movie to anyone!!! I love it! It's so great! I can't believe how perfect it is!!! Wow!!! Mothers reading this to see if it's a good idea for their kids: This movie is really good. If your kids are sensitive to blood, Dekim Barton gets shot and a bit of blood is visible. But that shouldn't matter because this movie is GREAT!!! Oh yeah, and Quatre will um, teach them to be nice and stuff.
