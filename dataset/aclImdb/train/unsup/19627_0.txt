This film is really entertaining. It has drama, action, and a good plot line. Filmed in beautiful locations the director and scriptwriter should be awarded along with brilliant acting from Pierce, Woody and Salma. It makes a film well worth watching time and again - which I do. Most people I know do seem not remember it showing at the cinema, but it is still great to buy on DVD - which I have - and it includes extra scenes, bloopers and the making of the movie. This movie and Pierce's remake of the Thomas crown affair are both outstanding and enjoyable. This movie "after the sunset" is one of my favourite films. I hope the Director makes more of these movies! Thank you so much!
