Well it wasn't horrible but it wasn't great. No where near as good as the original. It kinda tried to hard to be the first movie. I think it needed a better director. The opening title sequence was cheesy. Some the acting was cheesy except for Viggo Mortensen. Leatherface wasn't that scary in this movie, he was a million times more scary in the original and its 2003 remake and the 2006 prequel. It could have been better. The trailer was kinda cool though. This is a very underrated movies and it deserves it. The ending made no sense when Ken Fore's character died by Leatherface in the pond and had his head cut off by the chainsaw. Then he came back to life at the end and we see that it was only a little cut on his head. Wow this is so unrealistic. If you got your head cut off by a chainsaw you are not just gonna get a small cut your gonna be bleeding very bad! And another thing that was stupid about this movie is that it's a hole new family in this movie. It's not the same family of cannibals from the original Chainsaw Massacre. What is the deal with that? Leatherface can't get adapted. And wow there is only so many cannibalistic families in Texas! Give me a break! And another ridiculous thing about this movie is that it's called part 3 and it's the same plot as the original. It's more of a remake. All the Chainsaw Massacre movies all have the same plot.
