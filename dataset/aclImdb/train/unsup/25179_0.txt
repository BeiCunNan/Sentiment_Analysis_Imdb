The best of the entire series is here.<br /><br />Jason has returned, but is shot down with a vengeance by a large police force. After he is blown to body parts, it seems that the maniacal Jason is finally dead.<br /><br />But he's not. The only way that Jason can return is by gaining a new body, and he does this immediately, jumping from body to body, killing person after person, ruining life after life.<br /><br />The final death of Jason is here at long, long last, and, as unexpected, requires a visit to his old childhood home.<br /><br />I'll say, this is the only sequel in the entire series that is ACTUALLY scary. It's a wonderful horror film, and defeats ALL of the series, INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL, by a really, REALLY long shot.<br /><br />(It even sparks the beginning of Freddy VS. Jason... Hmmm...)
