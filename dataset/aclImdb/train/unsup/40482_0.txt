I see many people liked this show. Well, I'm not one of them. When I was a kid Goosebumps ans Are you afraid of the dark was my favorite shows to watch and it succeeded to entertain me. Eerie Indiana on the other hand, did not. I actually started watching this show with great enthusiasm. The show was down right to silly for my taste. Im not saying Goosebumps wasn't' silly, but EI was silly in a too silly way ;) I'll admit some of the episodes were okay to watch, but most of them just annoyed me.. The plots were just to weird to appreciate and the main characters were WAY to bad actors.. I remember the acting annoyed me, and I was a little kid!
