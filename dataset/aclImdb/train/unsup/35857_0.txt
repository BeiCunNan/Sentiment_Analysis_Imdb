This sequel to Mortal Kombat involves a bunch of video-game heroes trying to save the Earth from the clutches of bad guy Shao Khan. Special effects are downright terrible,the acting is,well,I wouldn't even call it acting,and it's as if the film is trying to throw too much at you at one time. If you must watch this movie,make sure it's on television,where you won't waste your money on a rental. This movie is just abysmal.<br /><br />1/2 of a star out of **** (I think I'm being too nice there)
