Most of these comments are definitely by cast and crew, obviously. This movie is absolutely atrocious, and not in a way that's fun to watch. It's taking itself too seriously to be considered an 'homage' or 'send-up'. One gets the feeling that the actor/writer/director (and review writer) thinks she's making a populist exploitation film, however, even most exploitation films had an actual story. The acting is probably the most offensive thing, but once again, not so bad that it's fun to watch and poke fun at. It's just bad. Like, someone got all their out of work hack actor friends together, threw in some family members, and then pulled a few people off the street kind of bad. But then again, one can hardly blame them when they're being forced to say the most ridiculous lines in the history of people talking to each other. The one redeeming thing in this film is the art direction; the costumes, color, and even the film stock are reminiscent of the 70's in a pleasant way. <br /><br />If you want to watch an actual 70's period movie with genuine camp, sex, and a reasonable story, watch "Beyond The Valley of the Dolls". If you want to burn your eyes out with bleach, then perhaps watch "Viva" instead.
