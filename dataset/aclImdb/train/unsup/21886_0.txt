The Elephant Man is one of my favorite films. The film's main highlight is the incredible performance by John Hurt. It is heartbreaking and touching at the<br /><br />same time. Some of the scenes in the film are incredibly hard to watch, when the worst of humankind is shown being as cruel as possible. As a result you may<br /><br />find The Elephant Man depressing, however, I see it on the contrary. I find the film to be a brilliant, touching work portraying a man desperately trying to be accepted in a prejudiced society. Watch it and make up your own mind.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, don't mind the fact that Mel Brooks produced. He actually had his name removed from the credits, fearing that the public would not take the movie seriously if his name was there. It is NOT a Mel Brooks- type movie.
