As others who've seen this film have mentioned, 'The Eyes of the Mummy' is not a horror film involving any mummies; rather, it's an insipid melodramatic tragedy. It was the first of director Ernst Lubitsch's dramatic films, after having started as a comedic filmmaker. The movie involves exotic places (this time, Egypt), which is poorly exploited here, compared to other such pictures. Pola Negri, in her first appearance as Lubitsch's star, performs some exotic dancing, too.<br /><br />'The Eyes of the Mummy' is a generally uninteresting film. The acting, especially by stars Negri and Emil Jannings, is overdone. Lubitsch employs slight dolly movements to nice effect in the finale, but otherwise the direction is prosaic and theatrical. From the sampling of Lubitsch's German films that I've seen, he was an unremarkable filmmaker and more unimpressive as a dramatic director. With these dramas, however, he received attention in the US--leading to his emigration to Hollywood.
