What a great film! i cant believe that it wasn't released in the cinema as the whole story is brought to life by the amazing acting of Maura Tierney and Adrien Brody. If it wasn't for the talent of these two actors the story would have fallen flat. Tierney is truly believable as a struggling cop, and Brody is just so smug as the kidnapper, that the whole film is unpredictable. I saw this film on TV and i couldn't take my eyes off it, completely riveting throughout and you really feel like you know the characters. Despite good performances by other members of the cast, its the two leads that make the movie. An excellent film i completely recommend.<br /><br />10 out of 10!! Excellent!!!
