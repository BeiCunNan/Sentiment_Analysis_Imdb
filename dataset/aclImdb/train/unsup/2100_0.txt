In high school I had to read "Of Mice and Men". It is one of my favorite books today. I loved reading it. It's one of the best stories I have ever read in my life. We also started watching the older version of "Of Mice and Men". But because the kids complained they wanted the newer one, we never finished the older version. So, I just rented the black and white version and I really enjoyed it. I thought the color version was great, but this one was more true to the story. Both movies are amazing. I'd actually recommend both if you enjoyed the book. The acting is wonderful and they stuck very well to the story. Go ahead and give the movie a chance. You might find yourself a treasure in this movie.<br /><br />9/10
