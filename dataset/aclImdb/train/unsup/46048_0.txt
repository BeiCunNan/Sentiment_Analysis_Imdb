This is the worst Godzilla movie I've seen so far. In fact, it's so bad... I've been showing friends scenes from the movie so we can laugh at it together. This movie... in all seriousness... is Godzilla vs. a s*** monster. Literally, a s*** monster. The film is supposed to give the message that we have to stop polluting the environment, or it'll kill us. The result is the s*** monster, Hedorah, which rises from human waste. The problem with this movie isn't the plot... I actually think it has a very interesting plot. The problem is the execution. The way in which the film was shot and handled was weird, goofy, and just plain ridiculous.<br /><br />EXAMPLES<br /><br />- Continuous repetitive use of shots of garbage. - Hedorah's magical wonder twin powers. - Long unnecessary scenes that don't go anywhere. - Drowning Godzilla in diarrhea. - The science makes no sense, even for Godzilla. - Sulfuric acid turning people funny colors, and why does Hedorah shoot out sulfuric acid? - Random animations. - Most of the fight scenes are Godzilla and Hedorah standing across from each other making hand gestures and blinking. How riveting. - The ending just goes on... and on... and ON!!! - Just when you think it's over, a TWIST!!! That makes NO SENSE!!! - And psychedelic, early 70's Bulls***.<br /><br />And the ultimate WTF moment...<br /><br />- Godzilla FLYING. <br /><br />This movie gets a 1. It is a grueling chore to watch, unless you skip to the most goofy scenes and make fun of them. Like Godzilla flying. Or Godzilla ripping off what I can only describe as Hedorah's testicles.<br /><br />I only recommend it if you want to get drunk with some buddies and play a game of MST3K home edition.
