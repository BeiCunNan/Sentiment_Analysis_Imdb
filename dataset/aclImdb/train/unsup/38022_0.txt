The second season of Masters is going downhill quick. After a strong start, John Landis started the downward slide with the hohum "Family" and it keeps on going with Ernest Dickerson's "The V Word". for starters, the v word of the title is for vampire. Strike one. The vampire subgenre is so overused that its just become blase. The story is pretty boring too. Two friends break into a morgue and accidentally unleash a vampire, becoming night walkers as well in the process. The best thing about this episode is Michael Ironside. He is one mean mofo. Its too bad that he's underused in the episode. There are some great scenes of atmosphere, but alone they are not enough to save another episode from getting weighed down by itself. Here's hoping the season takes a turn for the better since John Carpenter is coming up with his take.
