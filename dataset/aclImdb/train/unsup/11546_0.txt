Awful, awful, awful......I don't know which is better, watching this trash or a Pauly Shore movie. Maybe neither? It's been a long time since I've seen this movie, but I do remember how bad it was. Not funny, no plot, just a complete waste of time. The movie budget was probably about $17.00. Eddie Deezen is always a good comic relief in most movies he's in and I do remember Linda Kerridge was nice eye candy during her 15 minutes of fame, but I would rather have my fingernails pulled out than have to sit thru viewing Surf II again. I always enjoy watching a good "bad" movie but the powers that be couldn't even get THAT right.Thank God there was never a Surf I or Surf III.
