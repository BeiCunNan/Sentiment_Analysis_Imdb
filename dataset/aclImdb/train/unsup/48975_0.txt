Throughout the movie, I found myself uncomfortably irking in my seat hoping to fast forward the scene because of too much stupidity in it. The plot was supposed to have made a good film but destroyed with all the bad scripts, acting , bad humors, and so many pathetic scenes. The only part that made appeal to me was the first part, the 80s setting. Those kids acted it well enough. Also, there's too much inconsistency -- the young justin has acted good as a cool kid in school but the old justin is such a gigantic loser. <br /><br />Michael Rosenbaum is such a greatactor and he shouldn't have been casted in this movie, this destroys his reputation.<br /><br />Please don't make stupid film like this again. It's such a waste of time.
