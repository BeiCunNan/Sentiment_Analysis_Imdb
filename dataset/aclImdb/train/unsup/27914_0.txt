This film is great! I knew nothing about golf before, but this film helped me understand it better, and laugh for hours!<br /><br />It's about a guy who thinks he is meant to be a hockey player, but is actually rubbish. Happy: Yeah, I had a record once. I was the only guy to take off my ice skate and try to stab a guy...<br /><br />He shouts at the golf ball a lot which is amusing and the characters in this film are amazingly funny. It's fun to see Adam Sandler mix up bits from other films in the past and put them into his newer ones. You can actually see Chubbs (Golf Instructor) in Heaven in another Adam Sandler film, LITTLE NICKY. He even uses the catchphrase "It's all in the hips" which is amusing.<br /><br />If you like immature fun, laughing at people goofing off and stuff like that, then this is the film for you!!!<br /><br />
