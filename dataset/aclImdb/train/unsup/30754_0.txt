"The Last Seduction 2" is by no means high-quality entertainment. It's one of those movies you catch on cable at around 2 A.M., watch it since there's nothing better on, and end up getting sucked in by it. I mean, the original film was good, but it wasn't like it was a masterpiece. So I don't feel the filmmakers were being blasphemous by making this cheap, direct-to-TV sequel (the original also started out direct-to-TV, but later was released in theaters). Joan Severance is certainly no Linda Fiorentino. She pretty much plays a one-dimensional stereotype of a film noir vixen. But her performance is passable and like Fiorentino, she's not too difficult on the eyes. There are those little flaws that you'd expect in a film of this nature. For example, there's one scene where the female bounty hunter goes to a travel agency, which is in New York, and the man at the desk is obviously a Brit trying badly to hide his accent. But those are the kinds of things you can simply laugh at, and it adds to the fun of the film. I could've done without the scene where the film's villain punches one of his pregnant employees in the face. If this were a film of substance, I would say that the scene was shown to add to the film's realism. But instead, it was just shown for the sake of shock value, as a cheap device to make the audience hate the villain. The plot itself is actually quite good, and it has some nice twists and turns. I found myself hooked in throughout most of the film. As long as you take it with a grain of salt, "The Last Seduction 2" is decent late night entertainment.
