Well I must say that I have to add my two cents in on this one. I hate to be one to jump on the bandwagon, but in this case I just have to. This movie was horrendous!!!! So bad to the point where I actually laughed during parts where it should have been terrifying. No wonder Joan Collins has refused to even discuss this dreadful picture when asked about it. The storyline...BAD, the acting.....BAD, the direction....BAD, the special effects....REALLY BAD. I was surprised to see Robert Lansing in this film. He is a fine actor and I guess even great actors fall victim to insipidly idiotic pictures. This was made during the 70's, when disaster films and giant animal horror flicks reigned supreme. Can't find any redeemable quality about it whatsoever. My overall rating: 2. That's being generous, because I would have rated it a 1 if it weren't so hilarious.
