The Oh My Goddess series is my favorite anime story of all time. The animation is absolutely gorgeous. The music is nice and catchy. The love story will put tears in your eyes(not guaranteed). The ending is a pleasant surprise that puts everything together. If you don't like anime, you'll still like Oh My Goddess. This stuff is great, fun entertainment for people of all ages.
