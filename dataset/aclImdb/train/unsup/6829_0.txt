"Youssef died in Israel", states the Narrator. What the Narrator doesn't say is that poor Youssef was a suicide bomber, who didn't simply die - his death was incidental to his mission - to kill as many innocents as possible. Not innocents, you say? Occupiers...and therefore deserving of death? This seems to be what the Narrator, the director Juliano Mer Khamis, says. But once he starts down this evil road - that the Oppressed are allowed to kill their Oppressors, as well as their innocent family members - he loses legitimacy. And he does make this statement when he portrays these poor Palestinian Arabs as the Noble Oppressed and the Israeli army as the Faceless Evil. But it's not so simple as this; there's evil and good on both sides and the Palestinians have no monopoly on sadness, injustice, or fear. He of course has no responsibility to make a balanced portraiture. But let's call this film what it is - a propagandist recruiting film for Palestinian militants.<br /><br />That this film has won some minor awards is testament only to political correctness - and the kind of political correctness that is merely a fashion. The film is poorly shot, with terrible sound and a haphazard story. Lucky for the director that Arna and the three children died or he'd have no film at all. (Was he really sad when he stood over Arna's lifeless body? To me he seemed to be acting; perhaps he was thinking about his acceptance speech for the Czech One World Film Festival - whatever that is).<br /><br />I'm sure that the director gets a lot of pats on the back about his "brave" film. Too bad.
