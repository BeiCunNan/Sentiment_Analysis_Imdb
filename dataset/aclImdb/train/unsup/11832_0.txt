I was lucky enough (?) to see this film, kind of. If you are up and it is 3:00 a.m. and you are watching showtime on digital cable and see Shanks. You'll probably change the channel or see Marcel Marceau and think that it must be intellectual. If for some reason you then decided that you should see what people on the internet think, you have wasted far too much time. If you are an insomniac, you are in luck. I have problems falling asleep and tried watching this movie three times. Because frankly, the storyline made me laugh. All three times I made it no further than eight minute intervals. Should you choose to continue viewing... best of luck to you.
