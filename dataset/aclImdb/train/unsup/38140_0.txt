Second in the monotonous horror series takes place soon after the events of the first movie, with reporter Terence Knox poking around as he tries to discover what happened in the empty town. Strangely, although every adult and a bunch of kids were killed, no cops stick around after the first five minutes, leaving Knox free to discover bodies all over the place. Anyway, without a series of gruesome deaths there would be no movie, so people are killed by a bunch of spooky kids and, erm, a cornfield. It's pretty much the same mixture as before, but we also get boring troubles between father and son, perfunctory romances, and corn-this and corn-that. It's repetitious beyond belief, seems about twice as long as it really is, and as the plot of this film revolves around Knox piecing together the events of the original movie, it's also completely redundant.
