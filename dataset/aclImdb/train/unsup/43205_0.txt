I saw this movie on MST3K a couple of nights ago...let me just say, "It stinks!" It was very hilarious at times because of how awful it was.<br /><br />**SPOILERS** (not that it really matters)<br /><br />The beginning is ridiculous, showing clips from the wrong movie, and then once the movie does start, the acting is terrible, and very little things are understandable. The "pod people" or pod person, since there is only one, besides Trumpy, the lovable (not really) pod kid, goes around looking for its child (Trumpy) but you can only see its legs for most of the movie and when you do see it in its entirety, you see that it is very short and lame, almost looks like Alf. The main characters are a couple of 20-year-olds who are part of an awful band (they have a terrific musical number that is possibly the best part of the movie where the lyrics are incredibly inaudible They go into the mountains for a camping trip, and run into what seems to be some poachers and then find a cabin in which they stay with a family that has one young kid. As soon as the kid started to speak, I got a headache...he had the most awful high-pitched effeminate voice that sounded almost British. The kid finds a little pod person and calls him Trumpy. They have a magical time together (as is shown in one of the worst special effect scenes ever) but soon, Trumpy is accused of murder, (oh, right, the pod people like to kill humans by touching them on the head) and the kid leaves Trumpy in the middle of the forrest...THE END...even the credits were really awful<br /><br />I would recommend this science fiction thriller however, to everyone! Well...as long as its the the MST3K version, because this movie is pure crap. (1/10)
