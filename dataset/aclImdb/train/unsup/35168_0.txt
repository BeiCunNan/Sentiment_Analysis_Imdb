A big hit in '54 (3-14-54, Varsity, Palo Alto CA, w/The Great Diam- ond Robbery, Red Skelton's last at MGM), due to the ongoing popularity of I Love Lucy, with which this film has more in common than its makers knew. Like Lucy Ricardo, the girl Ball plays here (Tacy) is a selfish bitch, with a low IQ and a Me First attitude. Her childish insistence on loading their trailer with rocks after being told not to do so, puts her and her husband's lives in imminent danger. Stupid doesn't begin to cover it. One thing's for sure, very little of this is funny. Disaster comedy has a brief shelf life, and Tacy's moronic antics go sour in a hurry. Robert Surtees, a master with the camera, has captured some beautiful Technicolor images of America in his near perfect location work, which is easily the film's greatest asset. By the way, The Great Diamond Robbery's a lot funnier.
