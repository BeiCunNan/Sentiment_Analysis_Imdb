I'm not here to discuss plot or lack of it. I'm not here to discuss acting or lack of it. I'm here to say just a few things. This movie was so terrible. It was truly one of the most, if not the most, awful wastes of time I have ever had the displeasure of viewing.<br /><br />I'm all about cult flicks that may or may not intend to be scary but have some value due to unintentional comedic timing or they may just be a good b horror flick. This movie was neither. THIS particular piece of crap was washed up skinemax players trying to act. This movie is beyond horrible and will never get to cult status.<br /><br />I made an IMDb account JUST TO WARN PEOPLE on how crappy a film this is. Listen to me or not your choice but don't say I didn't warn you.
