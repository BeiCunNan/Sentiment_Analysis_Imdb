Many of you have posted comments on "Clockwatchers" as a portrayal of "Office Life"... Not true!! It is a movie based on each of the 4 main characters personal "Identity Struggle" and nothing more than that. Watch it again and "Forget" that they are in an "Office" setting, focus on the personalities you see in each of the 4 main characters.<br /><br />I'll give you a hint, Lisa Kudrow's character has Bulimia Nervosa.<br /><br />Guess who has OCD?<br /><br />"Never ignore the Obvious and Never over-look the Obscure"<br /><br />A great Movie! 10 "stars"
