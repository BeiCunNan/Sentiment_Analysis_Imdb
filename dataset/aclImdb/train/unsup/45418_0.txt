This one was like "Aliens" without the aliens... or maybe it was more like a sci-fi slasher movie... Yes, that's it, a sci-fi slasher B-flick. Some folks say that this movie steals the basic premise of "The Dirty Dozen" and puts it in outer space. Indeed, here we have a group of convicts turned into soldiers and sent off to a planet to secure a space station (or something). Amongst them are a religious fanatic female military doctor, a drug-addict/rapist, a nymphomaniac, and Corey Feldman as a computer nerd. The space station looks, of course, like an old factory. You know the drill: all of them get slaughtered (in a not too bloody way) one by one. Lots of running around, lots of shooting and near the end you won't even care about who's doing the killing or if the mutant make-up looks cool or not. I managed to sit through it without too many problems, so I guess it could have been worse.
