A group of freighted passengers, some superficial individual dramatic situations, terrorists, pilot and cabin crew killed or sick, an alert and smart passenger that has never piloted a plane (but knows a lot about planes), a helpful lady, a doctor, some torture and murders, plane with very few fuel, enough just for one trial of landing the aircraft, happy end for the survivals, a beginning of a love (sealed by a kiss) between the smart passenger that saved the survivals and the helpful ladyÂ… How many times have we, simple viewers, faced this screenplay? Turbulence 2 is exactly the same. Craig Sheffer has a horrible acting and Tom Berenger, who is a good actor, performs a secondary role in a very forgettable movie. Spending your time watching this flick is pure waste of time. My vote is four.
