I have to wonder what goes through people's minds when they put up money to have drivel like this made. Adam Sandler has made some funny films - Anger Management to name one. But this... this appalling excuse for humour beggars belief. I can only imagine they thought they'd cash in on Borat's success but missed the plot completely. What's even more surprising is some of the people who are in it..! Did they read the script?? In short, I think you need to be on something (and something strong) to find this garbage even remotely funny. About as bad as it gets. I'll certainly be thinking twice before approaching another Sandler film. Avoid.
