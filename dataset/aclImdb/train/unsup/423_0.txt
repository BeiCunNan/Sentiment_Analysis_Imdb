This production was recently shown on Dutch TV, the TV-guide announced it as a very poor Predator ripp-off. Since the original Predator is one of my favourites, I taped Xtro for later reference. One day waiting on a cable guy I decided to view it. It was a long wait, I can tell you that. The urge of pressing the FF button every second scene was so enormous that I had to give in. This piece of junk does not even qualify as a Cult-thing by any standard. There is nothing to laugh about and script/acting/screenplay/continuity are so poor that you wonder why in the hell garbage like this makes it on video and National TV!. Don`t waste your time on this one. Go rent the original Predator, find a big screen TV, some Dolby stuff and let that cable guy stand in the rain for an hour or two....
