I have never seen a better movie on TV than "The Blackwater Lightship."<br /><br />Declan (Keith McErlean) is in his final stages of AIDS and decides to spend the last of his days at his grandmother Dora's (Angela Lansbury) house. His mother Lily (Dianne Wiest) and sister Helen (Gina McKee) come to be with him, as well as two of his friends, Paul (Sam Robards) and Larry (Brian F. O'Byrne). As his family learns to accept the fact that he's dying, they begin to mend their relationships with each other and to forget a long-time misunderstanding that had kept them apart for many years.<br /><br />I can't find the words to say what a strong, powerful, emotional movie this is about life and love. For fans of Angela Lansbury and Dianne Wiest, this is a must-see (although, of course, it's a must-see for everyone). If you missed it when it aired in February, catch it when it's on again...don't forget to bring a box of tissues!
