This overly long film was based on one of Jack Higgins first novels, He has written many books since & nearly all of them have been far better.<br /><br />John Sturgis directed this & it was his final directorial effort.He had a very mixed career. His best was THE MAGIFICENT SEVEN,His worst was MAROONED. This effort is closer to Marooned than Magnificent Seven.<br /><br />Tom Mankiewicz adapted this from Higgins' novel, Tom wrote many screenplays, sometimes the apple falls far from the tree. Tom's father was the award winning director/writer Joseph (ALL ABOUT EVE) & his Uncle Herman, worked with Orson Welles on CITIZEN KANE.<br /><br />The cast includes some of the top stars of 1976(year of release) Micheal Caine, Donald Sutherland,Robert Duval,Donald Pleasance,Larry Hagman & Treat William, also Jenny Aguiter & Jean Marsh plus others.<br /><br />Nearly every one was either miscast or vastly changed from the original novel. In the book they all were flesh & blood,you were able to care for each one. In the movie they all seemed lifeless & listless.<br /><br />There is one needlessly extended action scene at the end.<br /><br />I can understand now why I missed this in 1976,I should have realized or remembered that it was not a good film.<br /><br />Ratings: ** (out of 4) 54 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)
