The directors should be commended for doing this film with such scanty resources. A camera, a couple of airline tickets, and one of the directors as actor. Unfortunately, the result shows. The camera is excessively shaky, to the point where a freeze frame is needed so we can read a road sign. The shakiness wore me down. The story is far-fetched. The improbable omnipresent, all-knowing terrorist leader eventually becomes tedious. The sound design used in the middle of the film is obnoxiously loud and abrasive. The only worthy content is the travelogue, an inside view of life in a poor neighborhood in the Philippines.
