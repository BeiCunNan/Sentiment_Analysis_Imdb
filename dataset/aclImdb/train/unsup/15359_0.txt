I loved this movie. It's about young and rich group of people trying to fit in and simultaneously find themselves. They like to party, the pleasures money and status brings, dress to impress, waste money and waste themselves, but deep down they are searching for understanding, acceptance and... love.<br /><br />The acting is brilliant, as well as the soundtrack. The actors themselves are attractive and well-dressed, so much eye-candy:) If you liked "Hell" (the French one) and/or "London" you'll probably like this one as well, although this one is put in a less self-destructive way than the mentioned movies.<br /><br />All in all, definitely worth watching.
