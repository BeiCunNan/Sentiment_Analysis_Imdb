Saw the Item on the Sundance movie channel, absolutely insane! The comments on this page crack me up. Practically a 50-50 split. The Item is most definitely a love it or hate it proposition of a movie. Even in my home, my girlfriend found the movie "all wrong" and my brother and I laughed our asses off! Too many so called "art films" take themselves too seriously. But the Item is never serious, always bashing cliches and playing with expectations. And while rough around the edges, this dark little ass kicker is always surprising. The Item is a sardonic and colorful freak-out. And that is its strength: you never know if the Item is kidding or not. It's a real strange brew: grim and comedic, beautiful in a low budget way, ridiculously brutal, and in the end... well, the end is so totally strange and sexual it's hard to classify.<br /><br /> (SPOILER) There's a graphic sexual encounter between a beautiful Asian woman and a muppet/grub/creature thing (I can't be the only one brave enough to admit I was kind of turned-on!). I am not a big film geek. Hollywood movies are predictable and indie movies are pretentious. The Item is neither. It's like a carefully put together car crash, you wince, you can't stop looking, and you can't get it out of your head the next day. So I'm voting a lO for this punk-garage-band of a movie.<br /><br />
