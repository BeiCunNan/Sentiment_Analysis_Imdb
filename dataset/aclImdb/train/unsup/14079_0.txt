***SPOILERS IN CLEARCOAT***<br /><br />This is a forgettable 'cursed treasure guarded by ancient monster' film that breaks no new ground and shows its lack of budget rather obviously. Near as I could tell, the plot involved an archaeologist gone bad who decides to loot a sacred site, and thereby awakens the ancient evil there.<br /><br />It's a good thing there were so many characters; since none of them had more than one dimension, it would have been hard for them to stand upright without each other for support. Hatch was incredibly annoying as the treasure-mad professor, though it's hard to say who was the MOST annoying. When you hate every character in a monster movie, it's hard not to hope the monster wins.<br /><br />The monster itself was rather disappointing; the CG effects weren't very good, so it was hard to tell just what shape it had. It seemed to bear a fair resemblance to the warrior bugs from Starship Troopers. Apparently, it was just some kind of animal, not a mystical guardian, since all it took to kill it was standard weapons - though it did manage to die and come back.<br /><br />Major continuity gap with the 'gold' they were carting around from the looted site. A good rule for any movie in which quantities of gold are being moved around by the characters is to assume that gold weighs as much as lead. A duffel bag full of lead items is NOT going to be something you can carry three of, let alone RUN with.<br /><br />The 'gold' artifacts themselves were cheesy, and their placement in the 'ancient' site downright insulting to a viewer's intelligence - unless we're to believe somebody's come down to shine them once a week for the last 10,000 years.<br /><br />Just proves that low-budget monster movies never die - they just go straight to video.
