I find it funny people dissing, the Count of Monte Cristo (2002) film version of the book. Yet, praise the Anime Version of same book. People and the crackers they eat. <br /><br />Life, as enough drama and hardships to live through. How much pain? Does a make take in to receive joy. Dantes suffers through hell, to be turn into a vampire fitting the book conclusion of what it took to become the Count. Yet, mentors his former lover and best friend child into manhood. Yeh, you love that!?!!?! And he doesn't kill anybody, only shame them. Bad Bad u little ones. Unrealistic, and u people treated as gold.<br /><br />I felt, so wasted of my time watching the series... I'm almost broke all the series DVD disc, until I quickly sold them on Ebay for $5.00 dollars. I haven't wasted money on a Anime Series like this, since Trinity Blood. The second half of that series was kill by the young prince vampire and lack up finish development of the past history and love story. Though the OST was good, just like Gankutsuou funny isn't it!?!?!<br /><br />I mean, the version of the Count is that of pure hate with revenge. But, he doesn't follow through on those close to his heart. And when doesn't find his heart, he dies cause of agreement clause. I mean, he treated the boy as a son and love him as such. He's suppose to hate his enemies, but no killing, no getting his hands bloody, no dirt on his soul, etc. In short, "He stop living life, only to care for son that's wasn't his and nothing else, bringing him to manhood."<br /><br />That sums up the story.... What a waste time!!!!!!!<br /><br />Watch Berserk instead, I said... And listen to Samurai Champloo OST<br /><br />The only thing between, u and this world is the history, you don't know
