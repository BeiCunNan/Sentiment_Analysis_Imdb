This Spanish film has recently had a limited UK theatrical release and has garnered lots of good local reviews. But despite being listed by the London Evening Standard as a Top Pick, my companion and I saw it in an otherwise empty cinema! Would the projectionist have gone home had we not been there, we wondered. No matter, we enjoyed this charming film, seemingly made by and for film buffs, from start to finish. Its charm is quite subtle, and I suspect a lot of people might not "get it". We liked the spot on period detail; the great locations (ever visited out-of-the way parts of Spain or Italy?), and the specially faded film colours are an excellent touch. The careful choice of Spanish pop music of the time adds to the atmosphere. And interestingly, there are enough knowing movie references to keep Super 8 fans and art-house buffs happy throughout (two examples being of course the low-budget Bergman remake, and less obviously, the deserted fairground sequence is pure "Carnival Of Souls").<br /><br />Sure, the plot line might be a little flawed, and the ending does flag a little, as mentioned in other IMDb user reviews, but I really feel people are being harsh. After all, the whole premise of the film is highly unlikely if you want to pick holes. Definitely recommended.
