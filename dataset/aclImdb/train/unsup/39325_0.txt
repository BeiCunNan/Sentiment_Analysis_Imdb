For some reason I liked this film when I was young, but now I can't imagine why. The dialogue is incredibly corny, and the characters were far too cliche. The film starts off fairly slowly, with only minor comic relief from Dennis Hopper. It does pick up in the last half hour, but the special effects have aged significantly over time- they were really cheesy, especially the dinosaur. I didn't really find any of the main leads likeable either - they were all fairly irritating and seemed to act in a way which seemed in contrast to the characters they were mean't to be playing. This is probably the worst of the eighties high school/teen science fiction tales, we all know it was made in the mid eighties- but did they have to make it so obvious? The story wasn't so bad- they just needed stronger characters, better dialogue etc...Unless your a fan of bad eighties teen films (and there are a lot of them) stay clear.
