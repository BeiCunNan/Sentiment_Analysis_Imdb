The story tells us about a man who owns nothing. Beside his few friends, he is homeless and has got no work, often nothing to eat but that does not worry him. He is only worried that " everything is forbidden nowadays". He is a professional car burglar who only steals to have a ride. Instead of selling the car he always bring it back after cruising the city in the night.<br /><br />If he ever has got something in his hands he does not know other than to share. He shares his bread, his room, his car that he steals but he cannot share his love.<br /><br />When the film finishes you see the explanation of the film crew: " This film is real because we made it up".<br /><br />He shows us the man with nothing but a big heart, perhaps too big for this life..
