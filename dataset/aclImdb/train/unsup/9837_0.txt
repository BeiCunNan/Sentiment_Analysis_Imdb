This attempt to mix two genres of American pie type and alien type does not mix well. And it seems this is due to lack of trying rather than difficulty of mixing. Such waste of time both for makers and viewers of the movie .The movie tries to follow clich√©s of both genres but the result is not convincing like the guy who stipends relieving of his virginity, and more unbelievable that is the caring and responsible alien type who think for a species that their survival is based on their distinction. Another unbelievable thing is the police that in camp with so much strange happenings does not suspect anything. These type of movies success is based on viewers suspension of disbelief. But unfortunately here this disbelief cannot be suspended. And this is because of lack of try on writers and director's side
