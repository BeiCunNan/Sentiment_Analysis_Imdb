Movies have always shown a fascination for these grim, dreary tales with unredeeming, amoral, warped characters at their center (especially if the tales are based on true events), but OUR fascination with such movies is harder to explain and borders on the masochistic. If there is ONE (1) thing to be gained from watching "Deep Crimson", I'm afraid I missed it. Although it's set mostly in the Mexican deserts, the film is rather claustrophobically directed by Arturo Ripstein, who lets several of his scenes drag on too long. (*1/2)
