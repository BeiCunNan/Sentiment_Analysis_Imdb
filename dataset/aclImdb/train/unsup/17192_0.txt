One of my personal favorites of all time, "American Graffiti" proves to be one of the most hilarious and entertaining films I've ever seen. With no real plot, it gives us nothing more than an inside look at a 1960s graduating high school class's last night cruising the town before officially becoming adults. Although they are probably just a little exaggerated, we probably laugh at most of the material in this film because we know how funny it could be if it happened in real life. Ron Howard, Charles Martin Smith, and Richard Dreyfuss were all excellent as some of the film's main starts. The film also features a young Harrison Ford (before he proved himself to be a good actor). There's not much to say about this film, since the laughs come from a bunch of simply random elements of the film. Perhaps it's each characters reaction to each situation that makes the film so fun to watch. The ending adds a small touch of drama and sadness to the film, but the movie is a far greater portion of comedy than the latter. What a masterpiece directed by a pre-Star Wars George Lucas. "American Graffiti" is one of the most enjoyable films ever made. Not the Best Picture of 1973 (that was rightfully earned by "The Sting") Nevertheless, this one is not to be missed.<br /><br />**** out of ****
