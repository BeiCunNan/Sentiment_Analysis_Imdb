In the same year that Steve Zahn was winning a Special Jury Prize at Sundance for Happy, Texas, this movie was competing for the Grand Jury Prize. I have to admit that I was not expecting a film that discusses triple penetration to be one on my list, but it came highly recommended by someone I trust.<br /><br />This film will give you some very interesting things to see, and I don't mean naked women, even though there is plenty of that. I was intrigued that the mother of this middle-class Chinese girl from Singapore was interviewed. Anyone that knows anything about society in Singapore knows this is 180 degrees from reality. In fact Annabel says: To Singapore, pornography is filth. That's okay. But it's become a national ideology that, just, you know, a value judgment, you know, to do pornography is to be against the collective agreement of what it means to be a Singaporean. F*ck 'em. They can lick my a**.<br /><br />I had to laugh when one porn star (MIchael Coxx) stated that her signature act gave porno a bad name, and a porn star (Ona Zee) trying to pretend that she did "high class" porn.<br /><br />It was a great inside look at the business that killed Beta and will kill Blu Ray.<br /><br />I love fried zucchini, but I will never look at a zucchini the same way again.
