Perhaps only twins like the Polish brothers could have made the quintessential work of art about conjoined twins--one that shows the uniqueness and depth of this bond, while universally hinting at how deeply love is rooted in our very flesh. Often the attempts to delve into these relationships (of conjoined or even identical twins) has been produced by non-twins and has assumed some kind of pathology--something either incestuous, or morbidly dependent. One thinks immediately of Cronenberg's Dead Ringers. What the Polish brothers have given us is nothing short of miraculous, utterly human and as poignant as anything I have ever experienced.
