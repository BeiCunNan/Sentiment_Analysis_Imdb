Boy do I love French movies from the mid-late 1930s. They were typified by wonderful cinematography, excellent sets and magical stories. Artistically, many of them are at least as good as anything Hollywood had to offer. <br /><br />A fantastic example of my appreciation of this older style is this movie, Dr√¥le de Drame. Like such great 30s French films as The Baker's Wife, the film abounds with WONDERFUL and very colorful supporting characters. Are they altogether realistic, NOT IN THE LEAST--but they are wonderful, nevertheless. They remind me a lot of the odd characters you might find in films by Frank Capra or Preston Sturgis. The silliness of the film also reminds me of films like Arsenic and Old Lace or Bringing Up Baby--and this a a STRONG complement indeed! In addition, this film is a delight on the eyes--with BETTER than Hollywood camera and set design--it just looks marvelous! So, despite all these positives why does it only get a 9?! Well, the plot is really cute but full of holes. In other words, the fundamental plot element leading to all the hilarity just isn't logical. BUT, WHO CARES?! It's so cute, well-made and the ride is so much fun, I really didn't care and I strongly recommend this film to anyone.<br /><br />I would try to discuss the plot, but considering how weird and convoluted it is, I think it best not to even try.<br /><br />FYI--for parents, there is a brief nude scene involving a charming serial killer swimming naked in a goldfish pond (!). You get to see this guy's tush--so, if you do NOT want the kiddies seeing this, either speed the DVD up when Mrs. Molyneux enters the greenhouse or try another film. It is VERY brief, though.
