"i received "nevermore" on tuesday January 20 and decided to wait until Friday night to watch it and it was a very long wait but so worth it. i've never reviewed a movie before, but i just wanted to try and share my feelings with all of you. it's a movie you really have to experience.<br /><br />i love scary, suspense and creepy movies, and i have to say "nevermore" did not disappoint. from the very first scene, i was hooked. it was suspense at it's best. not being partial, but judd was truly jonathan and fantastic and there is nobody else who could have played that role. it was so great to finally see him in a movie where he got more than 5 or 10 minutes. he carried the film beautifully. i also love his wicked sense of humor throughout. this was one of those cat & mouse thrillers, and it was hard to trust anyone. i will not give anything away, but the ending was shocking. i think that tom zambeck did a fantastic job, and i can't wait to see what other things he has in the works. i really enjoyed all of the acting, but outside of judd, i'd have to say that sidi henderson was fantastic as the sheriff. the one thing i hope is that people take the time to get this DVD and give it a chance. i wish that judd would get some kind of award for playing this tormented character but of course he won't. also, i forgot to mention that the music fit each scene, and i really wish there was a soundtrack. i also loved the creepiness of the house and how the scenes were mostly done in the dark. it gave it a very gloomy feel. the special features were also great, and hats off to the whole crew who did such a great job. i'm so happy to finally have this movie, and i'm going to watch it again tonight. i've also ordered a second copy just in case i wear this one out. also a little side note, judd looked adorable with his crazy hair & beard. i was in seventh heaven actually getting to see such close-ups of this amazing man. thanks again tom zambeck for a truly riveting movie!
