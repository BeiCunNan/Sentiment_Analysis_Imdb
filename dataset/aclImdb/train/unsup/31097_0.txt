I was in Australia when this miniseries premiered, and raced home each night to watch it. My host, on the last night, handed me and his wife a box of tissues and told us we were going to need it. He wasn't kidding!!<br /><br />The Eastwick family struggles through a century of world wars,famine, drought, and boon times but is cursed. Whatever Richard Eastwick loves, he loses. Whether it is bad timing or missed chances or just the normal "gotcha" of life, he has plenty of things, but no someone with which to share it. Beautiful cinematography, strong characterization and acting, haunting music, and Australia itself makes this miniseries unforgettable.<br /><br />I, too, would like to own this on video or DVD. My host had taped the whole production, but I was unsure if the VCRs were compatible, so I left the videos there. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Please let us know if it ever becomes available for sale - even in Australia!
