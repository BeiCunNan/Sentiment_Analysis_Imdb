WARNING: If you know nothing about the movie this review may contain some information which may spoil it for you. Be advised. This movie was horrible, from a crummy plot and bad acting to the poorly placed (and nonexistent in every review) homosexual theme. I bought this movie thinking that it was a black comedy as it had been categorized little did I know. If somewhere on the package it had stated that the movie was about a mentally challenged man, who learns to get over his obsession with his childhood best friend, whom he used to have sex with, I would have never made the mistake of shelling out money for this garbage.
