Meet the Yamazakis: father Kiyoshi, a failed TV reporter, is diddling his sexy prostitute daughter Miki; disturbed teenage son Takuya is being bullied at school, but dishes out the violence at home; and mum Keiko is turning tricks to fund her drugs habit.<br /><br />Into this extremely dysfunctional family unit comes a strange visitor who brings peace and harmony to the household through the power of lactation.<br /><br />Even by Takashi Miike's standards, Visitor Q is one hell of a weird ride, and is undoubtedly the director's most outrageous work to date (and considering this is the same guy who gave us Ichi the Killer, Gozu and Audition, that is really saying something!).<br /><br />From its opening sex scene between Kiyoshi and Miki (which narrowly avoids being overly explicit thanks to some judicious blurring) to the breast milk drenched final√©, this deranged shot on DV feature presents enough sex and violence for the most depraved of film fans, and even manages to answer that age old question "What should I do if I get my penis trapped inside a dead woman's vagina?'.<br /><br />Exactly what message Miike is trying to convey with this film is anyone's guess, but for wall-to-wall deviancy, you'll be hard pushed to find anything better (or should that be 'worse'?).<br /><br />I give Visitor Q a rating of 8 out of 10 purely for it's ability to render even the most jaded of viewers speechless.
