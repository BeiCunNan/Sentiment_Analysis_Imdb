Firstly let me say that i loved DBZ in every way, i was hooked on the American English version. The transformations, the music, the story, it was awesome.<br /><br />Now on to DBGT, it makes me sad when I have to comment so bad on something in-line with the dragon ball series. After I had finished DBZ I heard about DBGT and I was so happy that they continued after with DBGT, I then watched the first episode of DBGT... I didn't really know what to think at first, I decided to continue watching until i had seen just about all of the episodes (and that was hard work). What went wrong? The animation from the buu sagas in DBZ has far better than the animation in DBGT. I have nothing against the music style from DBGT but Bruce Faulconer's music style in DBZ should have been continued in DBGT, I was so upset when I didn't hear the good old Bruce Faulconer music playing within the battle scenes in DBGT. NOW let's look at super saiyan stage 4, WHAT THE HFIL IS THIS? It has nothing to do with the other stages of the super saiyan. What they should've done was make the fur/hair yellow/gold and keep the green tint in the eyes, this would've made much more sense, SSJ 4 in DBGT sucks to say the least (in fact it was the biggest disappointment of the series). The story is really week in places and really isn't fun to watch (pretty much the whole of DBGT is boring and just no fun to watch). Why oh why give vegeta a hair cut, since saiyans hair stays the same from when they were born, vegeta's hair was so awesome in DBZ, unlike DBGT. Only things I like about DBGT are that the voices from DBZ are continued here, the bad guys have potential. Other than that that's it.<br /><br />DBGT ruined the dragonball series for me and it upsets me to have to say that. Dragonball GT could've really been something great, but they screwed it up so very badly. If only they could remake DBGT to something more on par with DBZ.
