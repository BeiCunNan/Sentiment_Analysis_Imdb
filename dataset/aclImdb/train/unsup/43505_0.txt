This is without a doubt the WORST movie I have seen in years. Absolutely terrible. The whole film revolves around a 19 year old girl who decides she wants to kill her father. She is a mean and vile character and one can't help but ask?...who wants to sit in a theatre and watch a film about a character you absolutely despise?? There is no empathy for this character therefore you couldn't give a damn what happens to her, or what happens in the film. It also has one of the worst performances on screen by Australian actor Michael Dorman. How did this movie ever get made? It's pretentious, uninvolving, boring, and downright terrible. I strongly recommend you save your money and do not go and see this movie. If you don't believe me, check out the reviews....EVERY SINGLE REVIEW I have seen of this movie is negative. No-one likes it...and i completely understand why.
