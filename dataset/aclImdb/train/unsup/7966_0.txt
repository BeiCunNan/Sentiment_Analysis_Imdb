Fans of Kevin Smith's work may debate what movies of his are the best. Some say "Mallrats" some say "Chasing Amy" but I feel the majority are in the "Clerks." camp. One of the most screamingly funny films of all time that speaks about a lost generation. The intelligent, under-appreciated faux scholars of the Quick Stop and RST Video are archetypes of the modern man. Dante the lost. Randal the outspoken.<br /><br />Each of us have those tendencies in us. We all, at some point, have felt lost in the modern world. Yearning for the days past. The days lost. Wishing that high school was a full time gig. For many people it was the peak of their lives. Working a dead end job. Working a job that you keep because it's easy. There is no pressure and best of all no expectations. Dante Hicks is one person. Nothing special. Not especially handsome or intelligent. But he is searching for his way in life. We drop in on a day where his life changes. We drop in on his, what may very well be, his defining moments. His ex-girlfriend is getting married. His current girlfriend reveals sexual exploits that he'd rather not have heard. All this and his best friend, Randal, stirring the pot.<br /><br />Randal, he supposes that he knows it all. He has it all figured out but merely it's a cover for the frightened and lost boy that he is. No ambition. No future. And no strings.<br /><br />Clerks. is a modern classic that struck at a time when the age bracket didn't have a voice. We needed an outlet and Kevin Smith struck a chord in all of us.<br /><br />I've grown with Smith's movies. I see progression throughout his films. Clerks. was the beginning.
