This is the first movie which is Rayesque to the core.One of his most obvious permanent feature really appears for the first time: the search for a father.The relationship Bogart/Derek is intense (after the death of the biological one)and predates those of "Run for cover" (John Derek again playing opposite Cagney) and "Rebel without a cause " (Remember Plato to Jim and Judy: "I wish you could be my parents" )But I could also mention the Mitchum/Kennedy relationship in " lusty men" or even Heston and the Chinese girl in "55 days at Peking" .Or James Mason and his (biological this time) in "bigger than life".Emma's character predates The Rayesque young girl ,the one you meet again in "they live by night" (note how Allene Roberts resembles Cathy O'Donnell).Allene Roberts' beaming face and her hope against hope are the only ray of light in a dark tragical story.<br /><br />Like Fritz Lang,Nicholas Ray put the blame on the society.Nick was born under a bad sign ,like many of the director's heroes.John Derek gives an intense performance climaxing in the scene in the court when his wife's suicide is revealed.Bogart shines as his lawyer (he's more convincing in this kind of part than he was in "marked woman").<br /><br />Excellent screenplay with a superb editing ;many contemporary movies (such as the brilliant "Usual suspects" ) might have been influenced by the first scenes.Note that the story begins during the cast and credits ,which shows that Ray ,when he was on top of his game,did not know filler.
