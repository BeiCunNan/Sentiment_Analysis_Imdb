Obviously, you have to judge this for what it is and that's a low budget film. The effort is certainly worthy of praise. Theo van Gogh is a gifted director, Thomas Kist a good DP and the actors do a fine job. The film's problem lies in it's screenplay. Yes, Holman has created self-conscious characters and given them confrontational, brutally honest lines that certainly exceed the quality of dialogue in the average Dutch production, but I didn't find the characters psychologically valid, especially Katja's. They never struck me as real people. Holman doesn't display a true understanding of the human psyche, which is unfortunate for a psychological thriller. Therefore, it could have been better.
