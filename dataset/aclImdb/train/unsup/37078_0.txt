I like Maury Povich, but although I watch this show, only because of him and his advice, I don't like it. It just has an uncomfortable atmosphere, as the audience are very unsympathetic, and pre-judge people, before even considering that their accuser could be in the wrong too. The people on the show are poor role models to our society, honestly teenagers coming on bragging about having sex with 20 boys especially paints a terrible picture of how teenagers are supposed to behave. And how are we supposed to know what people are saying, when almost everything that comes out of their mouths is a "beeped" swear word, and then when they don't get the result they wanted they run off crying on stage or get violent? I also don't like the construction of the show, recapping what the guests are saying before they arrive on the stage is unnecessary, when they can just say it when Maury asks them to. However, like I've said I like Maury Povich, I like the fact he's honest, encouraging and straight-talking. But that's not enough to save the show, which is a 4/10. Bethany Cox.
