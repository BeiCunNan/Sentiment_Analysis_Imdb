Dil Chahta Hai is the story of three best-friends, so close that they could be brothers and how love and life changes them on the last summer they spend together before they go about their adult lives. These three friends are played by Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan, and Akshaye Khanna! Those names are Stellar enough Yaar?! But add the combination of Dimple Kapadia who plays an older woman whom Khanna's character falls for, and the delightful Preity Zinta (whom Khan's character almost misses out on) and you've got such a brilliant film that definitely deserves a chapter in the book of Bollywood great films! Add to that the exotic locales, the great sceneries, the hot and happening music, song and dance numbers and you just can't go wrong with Dil Chahtai Hai!
