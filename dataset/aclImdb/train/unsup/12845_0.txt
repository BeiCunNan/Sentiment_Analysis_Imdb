An unoriginal wanna-be art house flop. I saw it at Sundance and I'm sorry I wasted my vouchers on it. I don't know why, but the people at Sundance last year were really pushing it on the people. The makers ever kept emailing us asking for our comments and suggestions. I told them just what I'm writing here. Don't waste your time or money. The characters were unoriginal. The story was full of cliches and uninteresting plot development. I walked out with only like 15 minutes to go because it just got worse and worse. If I can say one nice thing about it, there was....well...Sorry, I can't say anything that nice about it. If you want to see something like this that is more interesting, might I recommend "Party Girl" or "Monster". They're a lot more fun, and you'll enjoy them a hell of a lot more.
