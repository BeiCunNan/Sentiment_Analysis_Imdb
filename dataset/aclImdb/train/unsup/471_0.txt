Sometimes you just want to watch a sleazy B movie even if you are warned that it is really low budget. You just want some serial killer sleaze to watch mindlessly.<br /><br />Lots of naked bodies, aberrant sex, and gore: all combined to make a film that will never see a theater screen, but will make a good slasher film for the aficionados.<br /><br />Don't look for anything more, because there isn't anything. No great acting, not even good acting. No storyline that makes any real sense. Things just seem to jump all over the place.<br /><br />Charles Durning will not be adding to his long list of award nominations with his appearance in this film.
