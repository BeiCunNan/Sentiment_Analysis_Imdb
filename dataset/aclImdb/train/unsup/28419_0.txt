There was a time when the drive-in was the place to be; it was at the drive-in that one could find gems like ISLAND OF THE DAMNED (an Italian fright film that began with a group of people coming ashore on an apparently deserted island, only to find that all of the adults on the island have been murdered by the children- a film that may very well have inspired the vastly inferior CHILDREN OF THE CORN). For some unknown reason, ISLAND OF THE DAMNED isn't even listed on the IMDb. David Cronenberg's first feature, THEY CAME FROM WITHIN (a.k.a., SHIVERS), is.
