A visual feast, and a glorious tale, The Adventures of Robin Hood has it all - a noble hero, a beautiful heroine, several hateful villians, great swordplay, lovable comic sidekicks, gorgeous sets, and exciting action. Since restoration, the colors are perfection itself, and aptly reminiscent of a comic book. The characters are strongly drawn, and wonderfully brought to life by the stars, and many of the era's finest character actors. Everything just rings right with this film. It's the best swashbuckler ever.
