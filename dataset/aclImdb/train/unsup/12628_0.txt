I gave this a one because IMDb doesn't offer a zero-option. Less than zero would be closer to the truth.<br /><br />In what at first at least appears to be a bad rip-off of the SAW movies, which weren't that great to start with, we find four women in the situation of being forced together with no memories and a lot of unpleasantness ahead of them.<br /><br />From there it goes downhill. ZERO plot for most of the movie, completely forgettable and unlikeable characters, a HORRIFIC soundtrack that had me reducing the volume to barely audible, and nearly complete predictability. No surprises at all at the end.<br /><br />Thinking of watching this one? Go watch paint dry while pondering your navel. The time spent will be more productive.
