This movie is my favorite one.I have watched it more than 10 times, I literally know all the lines.Every time a friend was visiting me and haven't watched the movie,I was suggesting this one and every single time the result was dying laughters. The actors are fantastic,Zouganelis is by far the leading one. In my opinion this picture truly gives a realistic picture of north Greece. This movie was also the subject in one of my academical projects,in a Greek university for a computer science department. I had to analyze the content of the movie, and describe the hidden messages deriving from this wonderful picture
