This film was released in the wake of "Pulp Fiction" et al. It contained Roth (who was in vogue), and dealt with the underworld. It flopped.<br /><br />In many ways it is not a crowd pleaser. However i has a talented cast, deals with family tribulations well; and has a distinctive style of it's own.
