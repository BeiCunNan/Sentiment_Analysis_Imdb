I can not agree with the person who posted here saying that the film makers knew that they were making a bad film and that we should be in on the joke and enjoy it. This film should stand as the very definition of hack filmaking. This film is bizzare, disturbing, poorly acted, terribly directed and astonishingly un-funny. Watching Terry Kiser crack horribly lame one liners while murdering a comatose teenage boy is like viewing a Carol Burnett skit from hell. This film is fascinating in the same way a major automobile accident is. Denise Richards looks incredible as always but, her poor acting here and in the box office and critical disaster 'Drop Dead Gorgeous' are examples of why she has quickly fallen off the radar. On a positive note, I think the Dinosaur looked top notch and the special effects were very good.
