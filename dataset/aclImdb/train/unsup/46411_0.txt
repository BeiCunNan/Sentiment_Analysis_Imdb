****possible spoilers**** Nobody makes cannibal films like the italians. This a good case in point. Three crooks, Mario Roberto and a woman, kidnap a young girl Florence Danville. They call in a favor and hide out in a house near a jungle with a guy and his wife. Mario rapes the wife. The guy extracts revenge by leading Mario into the jungle and leaving him there to be eaten by cannibals. The girls parents find out where she is and go looking for her. The remaining crooks leg it into the jungle, hotly pursued by the parents and owners of house. And so it goes on until the cannibals dole out some punishment on the crooks. Inept and poorly made in every department don't waste your money. Theres only a couple of gore scenes in it, and not very well done either. The jungle setting is'nt very convincing with neatly cut grass clearly visible in certain tight shots. The native cannibals themselves are laughable, they have strange 70s styled hair-dos and neatly cut side-burns!!!! Cannibal Holocaust still rules.
