This movie was as lame as they come. Right in step with all the other straight to video/TV National Lampoon ventures. I tuned in hoping for humor because I enjoyed the works of other members of the cast, specifically Bryan Cranston and Penelope-Ann Miller. I was hoping to see Judge Reinhold in something that might be up to par with his long ago comedies. I think I was also sucked in by the fact that this was from the writers of Vegas Vacation, which despite many others opinions is a National Lampoon movie I very much enjoyed. No such luck. There is none of the trademark N.L.'s wit to this movie. The jokes are dull, beyond low brow, and fall totally flat. This is one movie you won't be sorry you missed.
