I'm a big fan of post-apocalyptic movies; for some reason, the thought of civilization as we know it grinding to a halt on a backdrop of nuclear bombs falling intrigues me to no end.<br /><br />There are a host of movies that deal with Life After The Bomb, a whole lot more dealing with Life While Preventing The Bomb, but not very many that deal with Life Immediately Before The Bomb. This is one of the latter, and I think it pulls it off really well.<br /><br />This offbeat movie chronicles a few hours in the life of a character who has just found out that the missiles are on the way.<br /><br />This movie is rather offbeat; the acting is not bad, but just unlike normal hollywood acting, even despite a few familiar faces. The pacing is different, the sets are different, the colors are different. And in this case, the differences give it an edge that is quite intriguing.<br /><br />The main character (tom cruise's ill-fated co-pilot in top gun) displays such an acute, personal anxiety that really grabbed my attention and really made the movie hit home.<br /><br />While some of the other acting is less than stellar, in a movie like this it does not detract.<br /><br />This movie really did make me think about what I would do in a similar situation. Very thought-provoking.<br /><br />If you are as intriguied by nuclear war as I am, you should definitely watch this film.<br /><br />8 / 10
