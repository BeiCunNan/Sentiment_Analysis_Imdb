Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds.<br /><br />You have to hand it to writer/director Philip J. Bartel, the Uwe Boll of the gay niche market, for giving critics such easy ammunition in the title. This wanna be raucous sex comedy is sloppy all right - the screenplay contains dialogue that made me wince, the actors are unbelievably bad (poor Mink Stole, is she aware that she's being used in such a nefarious way? John Waters loved his subversive characters, Bartell only loves the idea of debasing them), well, I could go on with the poor quality of the tech credits but the people who lack self-respect and want to see claptrap like this won't be dissuaded by any criticism. I can only urge anyone reading this to do yourself a favor and rent a porn instead. trust me, you'll have more dignity afterward.
