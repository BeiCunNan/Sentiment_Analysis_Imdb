Steve Buscemi is one of the greatest actors of all time, in my opinion, for the simple fact that he makes all of his characters memorable.<br /><br />This film is an accurate look at life for the guys who never really made the cut and were left behind in a world full of unused degrees and previous money.<br /><br />The film is depressing, and therefore I'd recommend everyone watch it, especially those who were born into their own perfect little worlds and became what they are because of their parents' money. This one is for the tools of society that don't think that these people exist or think that they are merely peons. Get a clue; this was once the working population of the country.
