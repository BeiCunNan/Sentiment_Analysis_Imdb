This story could have been good but the movie falls terribly flat.<br /><br />The script was lacking and the acting was just not up to par. Dennis Quaid usually does a good job. he is the reason i watched it. But, I am guessing the script itself was so bad that the acting followed suit. There was no flow in the story. It went from one very basic scene to another. Very little was slowly revealed but rather just bluntly stated. I watched it with two other people and the response to it was all the same. Wow, that was bad! The story itself could have made a great movie but the attempt to make this movie good, failed miserably. Re watch 7 & Silence of the Lambs & you will be better off!
