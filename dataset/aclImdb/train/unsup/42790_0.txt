This movie's only redeeming features are the moments when you cant help laughing out loud at the overblown clich√©s. Such as when Arn is sad and riding through the rain. Or when Cecila is happy and starts to dance. Or every time Joakim Netterkvist makes his "sad puppy" face, or whenever the dramatic string orchestra starts playing. On the plus side this happens a lot. <br /><br />On the minus side, the rest of the time it just hurts to watch it. You feel sorry for everyone involved, especially those who paid for it. Everybody, the actors, the director, the editor, seems to be nervous working on such a big budget project (the most expensive Swedish film ever) and scared to make mistakes, and this total lack of confidence shines through everywhere.<br /><br />Impossible though it seems, this actually makes the books look good in comparison. Hell, it makes Kingdom of Heaven seem good. And that is quite an achievement.
