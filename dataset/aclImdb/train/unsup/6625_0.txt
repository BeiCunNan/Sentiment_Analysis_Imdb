I had seen the first movie some months ago and loved it, so when I saw the sequel came out, I couldn't wait to see it! Unfortunately, not only have most of the actors and actresses changed (Luke Malby is the only one who remains and is the only positive thing of the whole movie) but they have such little chemistry among each other that I almost felt ashamed watching. Between Luke and Kam the attempt to convince us they were the Edward and Paige from before felt so forced that I just kept asking myself all through the movie why did they change Julia Stilles, who had done such a great job. The producers obviously made more money than they thought with the first movie, and decided to make a second but came out with such a lousy result, that I think its a pity now that my image of the first movie is seconded with this sequel one! So if you loved the first, resist the temptation to spoil your memory with this second one!
