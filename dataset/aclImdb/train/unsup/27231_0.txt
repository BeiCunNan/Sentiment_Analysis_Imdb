More than simply the triumph of human spirit, Francis Ford Coppola's "Tucker: The Man and His Dream" specifically shows how Preston Tucker (Jeff Bridges) sought to challenge the dominance of the big automakers and they set out to destroy him. I had never heard of Preston Tucker before watching this movie, so it was fascinating to learn about his deeds. Bridges is great as the entrepreneur, with Joan Allen as his wife Vera.<br /><br />I see that Coppola had weighed making this movie right after "The Godfather Part 2". While I do believe that he made the correct choice in making "Apocalypse Now" - which I consider his greatest movie - this certainly would have constituted a fine follow-up to the films about the Corleone family. Definitely worth seeing.<br /><br />Also starring Martin Landau, Frederic Forrest, Mako, Christian Slater, Jay O. Sanders, Lloyd Bridges and Michael McShane (in his final role).
