now you may be thinking this is just another senseless weed comedy that goes no where, but in fact you are wrong. I got five is one of the most original pieces of film i have seen since the days of Tarantino and reservoir dogs. The film is superbly directed and involves the audience at all stages whilst the laughs keep pouring in. I highly endorse this movie and am sure it will reach the status of cult classic very very soon. See this movie and you will be pleasantly surprised. The characters are very entertaining and funny each on their own level, whilst the soundtrack is one of the best hip hop colabarations I have ever heard in a movie. Go see this movie as soon as you can, it is well worth it.<br /><br />Great movie A++++
