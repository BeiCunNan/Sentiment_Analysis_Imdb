I am completely shocked at the extremely high rating that this movie received. Expecting it to be pretty good, with some decent humour. I think i might have laughed once throughout the entire movie. However, I not very fond of any movie Adam Sanlder does, so i wasn't too surprised at the poor quality. The movie started out alright, the concept was okay, but then it just began to get much much worse. They should not have had the part where he starts losing control of the remote (basically the whole movie), and when you learn that Christopher Walken's character is really death, I lost all hope. That's where it got seemingly as ridiculous as it could get. Unfortunately, they decided to throw in him dying, and then waking up. WAKING UP? That really is the worst way to end a movie ever. It just means that the writers didn't want the audience leaving depressed so they tell you it never really happened. Lovely. Overall, i give this movie 3 out of 10 for boring me to death and not giving it a proper ending.
