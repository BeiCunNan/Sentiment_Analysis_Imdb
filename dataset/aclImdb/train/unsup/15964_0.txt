This movie reminds me a lot of Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs. It's the story of a pacifist pushed to violence. The premise itself is intriguing and the movie is interesting.<br /><br />What is lacking is a solid leading man. I love Charles Bronson, but he's too old for this movie and too wooden. The story is a bit tiresome and never really satisfies the viewer.<br /><br />Still, if you're a vigilante fan, check out Chuck and his sock full of quarters.<br /><br />
