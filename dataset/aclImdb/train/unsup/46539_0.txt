We read mixed reviews about Umrao Jaan...one is always apprehensive when going to see a remake of such a classic...not sure what to expect..I found the whole tone of the movie to be so morbid and Grey. Sure it is the story of pain but it is not told with grace. THe problem with the movie is definitely the way in which it is told. In most of the scenes the character of Umarao is shown crying weeping or fearful ..quite the opposite of a courtesan's character which is about presentation entertainment. Good scenes fail to make an impact. And the choreography is terrible too...merchant has done a terrible job no grace!!! All in all don't waste your time on this movie
