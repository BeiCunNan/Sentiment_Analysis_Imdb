Let me just say that I love Robin Williams. I've gone to his stand up shows, seen almost all of his movies, but this movie just didn't do it (for me). It tried very hard to be funny, but ended up being cheesy and predictable. I think I laughed at one thing, and I can't even remember what it was. I was excited to see GOB and Buster from Arrested Development in it, but that just made me sad that they took off a TV show that actually knew how to deliver comedy. Anyways, if you have little kids, they'll probably love it. If on the other hand you are the select few who enjoy laughing at The Office (UK) and Arrested Development, you probably won't like it.
