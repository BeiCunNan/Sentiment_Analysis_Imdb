The Lost World (1925) D: Harry O. Hoyt. Bessie Love, Lewis Stone, Wallace Beery, Lloyd Hughes, Alma Bennett, Arthur Hoyt, Margaret McWade. The special effects film of its time, a story based on the novel by Arthur Conan Doyle about an expedition to a lost world where dinosaurs rule. The version I watched was the most complete (running 93 minutes). Being a silent film, the actual plot is hard to follow but the special effects are terrific for a 77-year-old dinosaur movie. The most complete version was compiled from 8 different sources; that probably explains why the film seems very choppy and incomplete. All in all, a historically entertaining movie and certainly recommended to silent film buffs. RATING: 7 out of 10. Not rated.
