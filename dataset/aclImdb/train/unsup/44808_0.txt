Remarkable how The Lot, with each episode, just keeps sinking to lower and new found levels of incredibility. I put it on a par with "Plan 9 From Outer Space," director Ed Woods' best. This is one of the worst and most thoughtless presentations I've ever seen on TV and it comes from the NYUK channel, American Movie Classics (AMC). This probably explains, as far as I'm concerned, AMC's sudden decline in popularity and aimless descent into le potee. Also gone from AMC is their last remaining air of dignity, Bob Dorian, who always displayed himself as a knowledgeable and truly authoritative presenter. Thus leaving us with Wee Baby Burke and his sluggish monotoned delivery to tell us all about the picture we are about to see. I wouldn't doubt that most of the movies on AMC was filmed before he fell to earth. If you want to see a really good TV show about the struggle to "make it" in the movies, look for "Tales from the Hollywood Hills: A Table at Ciro's." This one hour show was combined and intercut with another and retitled "Power, Passion and Murder" and still shows up on TV occasionally. As for "The Lot," stay close to the flush handle.
