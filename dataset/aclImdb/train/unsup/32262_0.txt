Wow, I must say: not anyone can watch this movie all the way to the end. I did, and it was one of my best deeds. So, I am a fan of Trash (if you check on other comments of mine you will see it). Alas, but this movie is not Trash: Trash has got style, for the ones who understand. This is just a real bad and boring movie, full of cliches, ridiculous stuff and so much sucked from Predator that, if I had the rights on Predator, I should sue this guys for this.<br /><br />Mark Dacascos usually acts on some B blockbuster-wannabe movies, but this is beyond him: not even he deserves this. I wonder if Steven Segall deserved to be on this flick.<br /><br />The scientist is real mean, and believes he created the perfect being, and nobody understands his creation. Huh-huh. I've heard this on practically ALL bio-accident movies I've watched.<br /><br />In the final showdown, the doctor goes back to his native roots (ugh!) and takes on the creature in a scene obscenely sucked from Predator.<br /><br />That spec-ops team is no match for the little kid. He saves the day.<br /><br />The monster and the helicopter crash are true special defects.<br /><br />Was this movie profitable? For the producers, I mean. For the audience it surely isn't.
