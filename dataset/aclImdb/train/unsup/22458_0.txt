A beautiful, sexually charged, noirish horror pic from Greek director Nikos Nikolaidis. A mother and daughter, whose modus operandi has parallels with the duo in Shindo's "Onibaba", trick and sexually toy with various gentlemen until Singapore Sling, looking for his lost love, arrives on their scene and unconsciously fractures the mother-daughter dynamic. The two enjoy a very hot sexual relationship that is vividly but not graphically depicted. Other sexual episodes are depicted in delicious detail and the film does not hesitate to go totally hardcore when necessary. For mine, this is an amazingly erotic film that depicts sexual desire as a form of raw anarchy. Various fetishes such as vomiting, urination, sado-masochism and necrophilia are presented honestly and without judgment. Stylistically, the film has a strong, theatrical quality, and it is interesting how Nikolaidis has the actors address the camera at various intervals. The stand-out performance is that of the insane daughter, played by the extraordinary and outlandishly sexy Michele Valley. Panos Thanassoulis, as Sling, has virtually no dialog, but makes his mark in a pivotal but surprisingly neutral role. Black and white cinematography by Aris Stavrou is stunning, as is the splendidly rich production. "Singapore Sling" is an original in every sense of the word and is one of the most accomplished horror films of the modern era.
