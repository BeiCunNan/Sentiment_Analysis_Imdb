This is one of the worst movies ever made. As a former Marine, I lost track of all the uniform and protocol errors they made. That being said, the horrible acting, terrible action scenes, and everything else actually made this movie fun to watch. I spent the first 15 minutes laughing so hard I just about died. Everything is so forced and stupid, with absolutely no point to it. With the exception of the guy from T2, every cast member was completely forgettable. This film made some of the earliest Arnold movies look well acted and directed. Don't watch this movie if you expect a serious film, but, if you have an hour and a half to kill, check it out, at least it will make you laugh.
