Having recently gotten the first Looney Tunes Golden Collection from my library, I went through all the extras first (except the "music only" shorts). Then I started watching the cartoons in order of appearance. Baseball Bugs is the first one listed on disc one. This Friz Freling effort from a Michael Maltese story piles on all the gags that one always associate with the Warner Bros. cartoons, like the one when Bugs, as the lone pitcher of a baseball team, manages to strike out three members of the opposing team by throwing the ball reeeeaaaaallll slow as all three swing their bat real quickly with the announcer saying at that speed, "One, two, three, out!" Or the one when Bugs distracts one of them by showing a picture of a sexy girl to keep him from catching the ball. Or how about a bat boy with bat wings giving the rabbit a couple of bats. There's plenty more but I don't want to spoil the whole thing for you so all I'll say is: Just watch.
