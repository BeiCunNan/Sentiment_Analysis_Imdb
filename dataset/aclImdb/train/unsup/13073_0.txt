This movie to me is great because it shows the true ups and downs in marriage and friendships. Gabe and Karen are like real couples. They argue, settle, cook, clean,raise kids and have meaningful friendships. Tom and Beth are also semi-normal because she cheated on him early in the marriage and he found out, but they stayed together for the kids, like most parents do. Gabe and Karen are like me and my Husband, so that is really great to see. When Gabe and Tom are having lunch and Gabe tells Tom that the four of them were to grow old together, watch each others kids grow up and cry at their weddings, now that is friendship. Karen and Beth are oddly different, Beth stated that she tried to be more like Karen, but no matter how much she stirred her soup still stuck to the pot. Karen would have never said that to Beth, Karen longed for family and friendships, she stated that if she could make her friends her family and that it what it is all about. All the Dinners, the countless hours of video tapes, all those vacations we spent on the Vineyard. 12 years, two kids, He wants a divorce. This is a must buy movie that you can watch over and over and never get tired of.<br /><br />JM
