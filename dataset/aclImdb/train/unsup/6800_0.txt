Chuck Norris fans are a forgiving lot. As long it has their hero beating the beans out of whoever is stupid enough to cross his path, besmirch his honor or step on his hat, then it's body check time! CRUNCH! KICK! SPLAT!<br /><br />"Forced Vengeance" follows the old tried-and-true story of Chuck going into action to protect the innocent and punish the guilty. This time, he's in Hong Kong and single-handedly (of course) eliminating the forces that conspire against his adopted family who also happens to run a prosperous casino that evil types would rather see under their control or (better yet) destroyed. <br /><br />All goes well until they get Chuck mad by killing just about everybody he cares for... then they step on his hat! CRUNCH! KICK! SPLAT!<br /><br />Anyone who's seen a Chuck Norris film knows what to expect. It shouldn't matter whether "Forced Vengeance" is good or bad to them. Well, it matters to me. He seems to be reading off cue cards for the drama scenes until he goes into high-kick mode.<br /><br />Two stars. Mostly for what action there is. <br /><br />You dare to disagree with my review? CRUNCH! KICK! SPLAT!
