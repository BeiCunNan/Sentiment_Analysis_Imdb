Since I am a big environmental fighter for clean and sustainable life, this movie was a big refreshing from the start. A funny, simple said story was something new for me since watching Earthlings. Excellent acting crew, camera, director, screenplay and story were very much promising until beautiful nurse forbidden to alien Mila holding a baby whose mother left it because Serbs raped her (during the war in Bosnia probably-but not said). It had to be a Serb who was a rapist and a Bosniak women who is a victim. Crimes were on both sides but this was a classic fascistic move from a story writer or director. Shame, this movie was more promising but fascistic media always has to be involved in our lives. In 90s every Serb was a war criminal and now every Muslim is present as Osama Bin Laden but that's another story. Shame Shame!
