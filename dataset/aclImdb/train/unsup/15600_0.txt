I highly recommend this film. It's funny , very funny and like the tagline of the film says, YOU WILL L-A-U-G-H!!!! Powell & Loy make a great team, that is why they went on to make 14 films together, they have wonderful screen chemistry. Powell is one of my favorite actors and he's just so good in everything he's in whether it be comedy or drama, but I have to admit I love him in comedies more than anything. Highlight of this film : The "cooing" moments! *pees* Also when Powell dances alone! Check it out! If it doesn't make you laugh you're dead! ;-) <br /><br />
