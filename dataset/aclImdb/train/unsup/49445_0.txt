Take "Six-String Samurai," suck every last bit of humor and talent out of it, set it in Australia and it STILL wouldn't be as awful as this unwatchable mess of self-obsessed celluloid.<br /><br />Not so much a movie as it is a horrendously long, mind-bendingly pretentious music video - "Freedom Deep" may very well qualify for Legendary Bad Movie status. At the very least it has to be one of the most toxically self-indulgent train wrecks since "Lisztomania" - which is an achievement of sorts, I suppose.<br /><br />The film's story, such as it is, concerns the efforts of Liam to bring the holy word of Kurt Cobain (!) to a suffering, nuke-ravaged humanity. Interspersed with this epic quest are flash backs to Liam's youth when he was a pudgy, abused kid who looks abso-tootly-ootly nothing like his older self.<br /><br />If the plot of this film sounds even mildly interesting - it's not. It's tedious and trite by turns and the film's only saving grace is that there's no dialog. Indeed, I can't even begin to imagine how teeth-grindingly awful this mis-begotten mess would be if we had to listen to these characters speak.
