Alot of people throw filth at this movie, I dont know why. This movie breaks new grounds. It is the first Drama-Comedy I have ever scene. And it is truly strong on both the dramatical side and comical side.<br /><br />The acting was superb! People think elsewise, they think "a bunch of dumb white kids trying to be black". Because of this, they think the actors have no skills. But as a matter of fact, THESE CHARACTERS ARE VERY BELIEVABLE. THE CAST WAS PERFECT!!!! Nobody in this movie did NOT act unrealistic. Even Flip Dog's racist dad was believable, I cracked up on the part when he said "So now you're a n!gger?" That line had me choking on my popcorn, but there are so many funny scenes in this movie. That also shows that this movie is NOT just based on characters trying to be black. Flip Dog is actually the ONLY character who thinks he's black.<br /><br />I predicted that people would hate this movie, too bad they don't understand it. As matter of fact, if this movie wasn't so realistic as it is, it wouldn't be funny. The stereotypes in this movie are so very true and is what makes it hilarious.<br /><br />Don't worry about the plot in this movie, a movie like this doesn't really need one. It only excells in the areas that it focuses on- reality, drama and comedy.<br /><br />Much credit goes to a genius director!<br /><br />8/10
