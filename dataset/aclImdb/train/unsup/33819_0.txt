I have seen my share of bad movies... Battlefield Earth, Freddy Got Fingered, Bottom's Up, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Garfield: The Movie, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Aliens Vs. Predator 2: Requiem...<br /><br />But this is the worst movie I've ever seen... I can't bear talking more about it. It ruined my life and view on films... Don't watch it. Never.<br /><br />Well, I never expected anything, but the cover said that it inspired Peter Jackson and Quentin Tarantino, two of my favorite directors, in their youth and early film-making, so I thought it would be interesting.<br /><br />Not even in an Edward D. Wood Jr. movie did I see worse acting or special effects. If Warner Brothers gave their "Batman Begins" script to a three year old without money or friends, he could have made a better movie. I swear.<br /><br />I'm serious, it shouldn't have been made. It just left me with a bad bad feeling of wasting my life. I felt lonely after watching it. Thank God I got a discount at the video store... I even sold it back to their sorry asses - double the price!
