Sitting through this movie made me realize just how gullible I am by believing a good tag line. This movie, on paper, looks good. I liked the idea, and am not biased toward poor cinematics, poor dialog, and poor acting if the plot or narrative of a story is really original and fresh. Often times all those overcome a poor plot in Hollywood, and sometimes, a superb plot can overcome them.<br /><br />Sadly, it doesn't happen here.<br /><br />This movie is a metaphorical train wreck that I kept hoping would reach the destination no matter how horrible the journey - and it doesn't.<br /><br />Just skip it and watch "The grand canyon" again if you're looking for enlightenment of the human condition.<br /><br />
