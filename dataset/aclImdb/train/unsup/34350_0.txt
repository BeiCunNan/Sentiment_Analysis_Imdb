This film marks the end for the teen horror come back.<br /><br />In this baffling mess of a film, Jeniffer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Junior return to escape the hook of a fisherman with a new breed of fresh faces all doing their best to get written into a possible sequel. From the beginning you know what going to happen. If you've seen any shlock horror film you'll be ahead of this mess from the beginning. But these criticisms can be explained with the past record of director, Danny Canon. He directed Judge Dredd but even this is new ground for this untalented hack.<br /><br />There are two redeemable characters in this film and their planted on Jeniffer Love Hewitt's chest. They truly deliver exceptional performances and apart from their occassional freedom the film doesn't add up to much. In an attempt to pull in profit though they are given "ample" of screen time, a factor which encouraged a second viewing on video. <br /><br />Brandy is the only speaking character that leaves an impression. She is a wasted talent in this movie but the girl fights to rise above the horrible material. The rest of the performances are wooden and simply going through the motions. And what a motion for Hewitt! <br /><br />Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date with the slow motion button on my VCR. Grade - D+
