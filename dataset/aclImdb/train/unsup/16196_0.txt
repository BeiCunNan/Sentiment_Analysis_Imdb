I have read a number of comments that criticised the film in light of it being a better read than it is a movie. I have not read the book nor am i likely to as i prefer visual entertainment most of the time. To compare any film to its paper bound inspiration is unhelpful and unfair. If one has heard it once then we have heard it a million times, books rarely get translated into faithful or superior films unless of course the book is about 10 pages long or pure drivel. so, do not be persuaded by any such comparisons, simply ignore such comparisons and let the pixels do the talking.<br /><br />If you haven't read the book the film will surprise. It is dark and morbid with just about enough realism to keep it from turning into an irrelevance. It does walk a tightrope between credible and confusion briefly but this just kept me focused on the story and the characters which perhaps did need more development however it works well enough to keep the overall feel of the film moving in a consistent direction. <br /><br />There are some annoyances within the direction that may cause one to ask how? why? but again they become part of the frustration and panic that maybe the director had in mind for the audience. <br /><br />I liked the film and more than anything it was an enjoyable experience which is what after all we watch films for.
