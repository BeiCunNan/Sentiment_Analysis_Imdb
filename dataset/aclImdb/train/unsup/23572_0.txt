This is the movie that got me interesting in the art of film making. It's the first and adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic tale. And in my opinion, the most faithful in keeping with the spirit of the story. The technical achievements of the movie are the most fascinating aspect of this movie though. Not only predating computers by a huge margin, but also predating the Dunn Optical Printer which became a standard in motion picture effects departments. The stop-motion scenes are quite lifelike, if not entirely believable. It also ranks with Jurassic Park in it's scientific accuracy, based on the knowledge of prehistoric life at the time. Occasionally, the animated dinosaurs step ahead of their time, traveling in family groups and herds. The story structure itself in this film is choppy, even in the restored length. However it is still very enjoyable and worth viewing at the very least as a curiosity piece.
