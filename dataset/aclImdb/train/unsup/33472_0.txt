This is some of the worst crap I have ever layed my eyes on... I think that a 5 year old in kindergarden could write a better script, and that using only charcole and paint.<br /><br />It's movies (or is it even a movie?) like this who makes people download movies from the net. Had I bought the movie, I would have been sad for the rest of my life (Yes, It's THAT bad.....)<br /><br />But if i should come up with something thats "good" about this movie, it must be the reference to Star Trek and the shirts the "Geeks" are wearing.<br /><br />Now I'm off watching Zombies 94 or Jesus Christ Vampire Slayer (Hey at least it's got a point ;-)
