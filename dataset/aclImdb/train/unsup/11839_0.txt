SHANKS by its very rarity has conjured a reputation it does not deserve. The story is one of the oddest ever put on film. A deaf/mute puppeteer learns how to animate dead bodies. He re-animates the aged inventor who shared the process with him. He re-animates (after he arranges their deaths) his evil sister and brother-in-law. He then arranges a birthday party for a young girl he likes, where the wait staff are his dead family members. Then a motorcycle gang bursts in, starts drinking and spreading mayhem, rapes and kills the young girl and festoons themselves about the inventor's castle. Our hero re-animates the inventor who one by one kills them all, although he does get the honor of offing the leader of the gang himself. The one woman biker seems to disappear entirely from the script.<br /><br />The direction is awful as is the screenplay. Totally illogical actions and responses predominate and it takes seemingly FOREVER to complete a simple act. The whole end of the film from when the bikers enter seems to go on for an eternity.<br /><br />Marcel Marceau does a marvelous mime job as both our hero, Malcolm Shanks, and the Aged Inventor. Fellow mimes, Tsilla Chelton and Philippe Clay, play the evil siblings. It is worth one's time to watch these masters of the art at work, even though the vehicle is so shabby.<br /><br />As it's practically a silent film (over 90% without dialogue), Alex North's comedic and atmospheric musical score provides much of the pointed direction as to how we are supposed to react to these curious events and as such had a functional value to the film, which resulted in an Oscar nom for Best Music Score.<br /><br />If you're really hard up for something to watch, or are fond of mime, it's a go. Otherwise, turn to the weather channel.
