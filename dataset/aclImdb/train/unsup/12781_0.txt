i FINALLY saw 'i'm going to tell you a secret' tonight from a copy someone had and was absolutely stunned for words when i saw it. i found the whole film enormously riveting and gripping...and yet i am more stunned that there hasn't been more hype about it.<br /><br />is this because a lot of people still haven't seen it yet? even on IMDb. i have read reviews by people and external reviews by matthew rettenmund (madonna encyclopedia author) and everyone seemed to say it was good but not fantastic.<br /><br />i actually thought the film was far more ambitious than truth or dare and had a depth missing in first documentary.<br /><br />i absolutely loved it and cried a couple of times! why has this film not been hyped as much as it should be? any thoughts?
