My sister and I went to rent a movie one day, and came upon this one. We both thought it was more sexual, but it wasn't. Despite that, both of us loved it. Personally, if i find it on sale, I'd buy this movie without hesitating. Makes you think about how much you actually need ALL your senses to live. Very thought provoking.
