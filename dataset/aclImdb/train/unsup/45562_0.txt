Thoroughly entertaining performances from Richards, Theron, and Torn can't save this movie from its sub-par direction and formulaic predictability. Richards delivers his lines with the same quirky mannerisms that I found hilarious in Seinfeld, but if you didn't like it there, you won't like it here. Theron shows promise though she has to create her performance as she is given nothing by the material. Perhaps the funniest moment in the film comes when Torn tells his sob story after he puts himself on the stand. I got the impression Jeff Daniels wasn't trying very hard in this film, but you can't blame him given the tired storyline and studio-oriented vision. The script was most likely written by a computer, or more likely a desperate, soulless, sellout of a hack with a talent for gag suppression. For diehard Michael Richards fans only.
