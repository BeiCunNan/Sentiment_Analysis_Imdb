Just to counter 'some' of the reviews here on 4400 that have titles like 'Awesome' and what more; this show is beyond terrible.<br /><br />I just finished the first 30 minutes of the pilot. That may not be a lot, but it was quite enough. First off I see a bunch of actors delivering what appears to be script. The Clich√©-ridden dialog ranges from "I'm worried about you Tom" and "Is it supposed to be that bright?" The latter referring to a fastly closing comet as if the character already saw the episodes of this series and suspected it may not be a comet at all but rather an extra-terrestrial 'Ball of Light' made by a wannabe CGI-expert who normally does the catering.<br /><br />The Intergalactic marble is counter-measured with ballistic CGI missiles. In clear sight we see the missiles hit the object somewhere beyond the moon. Not only did it take these missiles just a few seconds to get there, they must have been the size of a small African state to be visible that far away. Despite their gigantic size, the SGI-Missiles have no effect and the Ball of Light conveniently descends in the back-garden of our protagonist's Observatory of Stray Alien Objects. It must have had a map.<br /><br />After the Ball of Light delivers a couple of thousand CGI produced actors, the contest for the Worst-Wooden-Dialog-Award continues. Some of the CGI-actors turn out to be real people and they are held hostage by Homeland Security for 3 weeks being thoroughly interviewed while none of the returnees remembers a damn thing of their trip in the ball of Light. I'm sure this made for excellent conversation during those interviews.<br /><br />Eventually the returnees are set free. One of them is a woman who's been gone for 10 years and thinks it would be a good idea to visit her daughter and husband after so long. When she gets to the house where her husband and daughter live, the screenwriters truly run out of inspiration and quickly down a six-pack of tequila flavored beer. Seeing his wife return after being gone for ten years, being abducted by aliens no less, the husband, in no more than 4 lines, tells her that 'alas things have changed for him' and adds a hasty 'sorry' as if he was sending some kids away who tried to sell him cookies. Without a single real-life emotion, the woman turns around and departs.<br /><br />I don't know what the people that find this show even remotely enjoyable are on, but I wouldn't mind trying some of it.<br /><br />This is considered good TV? Astonishing.
