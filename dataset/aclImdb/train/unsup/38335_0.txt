I could see a train wreck coming so I didn't bother to watch the ending of this piece of trash. Given an intelligent editor before the script was finished, there might have been a good movie. It rambled all over, and when everyone came together I could tell it would get worse. At least those of you who haven't seen this won't have the ending spoiled by me! The people who reviewed this movie and said they liked the effects and the props were clueless. I was seriously annoyed when I saw that idiot US Paratrooper officer (played by Michael Madsen). The paratroopers were elite troops. Clowns just didn't make it that far. Also, I noticed that his second in command had 82nd Airborne patches, while his superior had 101st Airborne patches. Every time I saw the US paratroopers together they were wearing a mish-mash of uniforms.<br /><br />I imagine the Brits who know a thing or two also detested the poor props.<br /><br />Anyway, don't bother with this stinkeroo.
