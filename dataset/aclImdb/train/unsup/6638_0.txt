i just watched this movie last night and i was very very disappointed, what happened to the original cast? this kam heskin actress is no good n this movie,she acts very awkward and seems out of line always,i cant feel inspired. Why are they messing up with this movie it seems this is a very low budget movie. The original cast are all marvelous why are they replaced? The only thing that i will watched this movie is Luke Mably who seems not happy also doing this.Why are they turning this movie into a joke. All the things showed here are all disappointing except for Luke who still perform a great job. I will rate this movie negative.
