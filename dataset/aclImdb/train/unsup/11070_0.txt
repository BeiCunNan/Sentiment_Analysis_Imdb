I love James Spader - that's why I sat through this movie - not once (years ago), but twice (very recently). Sure, he's gotten sort of doughy in recent years, and is now in that awful TV show, but in this movie he is just so damn appealing: the most expressive eyes, those succulent lips. Yum! Susan Sarandon, OTOH, is way overrated as both an actress and a sex symbol. First, she's not at all attractive physically. The big, baggy bug eyes bothered me most. I found her character repulsive, crude, pathetic and incredibly annoying. Her crackling laugh in the bar scene made me *so* want to smack her. Her desperate "trapping" of him at the bar was painful to watch. How sad that she had to get him plastered and dupe him into coming home with her. Then, she just about rapes him. He resists, but later decides it'll take less energy to just let her have her way with him. He seems disgusted with her the morning after, and leaves callously, saying he won't be back - YET, we're to believe that within the next day he's become smitten with her and discovered he can't live without her? PLEASE!! Age is not the issue. She's crude, classless, unlikeable, a filthy slob, a drunk and a disgusting chain-smoker, yet this handsome, wealthy,young, successful, opera-loving, and impeccably neat "catch" falls hopelessly in love with her. ABSURD!!! It James Spader weren't in it, this movie would have gotten a -10!
