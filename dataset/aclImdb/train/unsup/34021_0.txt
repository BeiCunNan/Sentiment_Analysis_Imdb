For me, this bar scene is the most enjoyable moment of the movie. Otherwise be ready for 90 minutes of boring dialogs, sad locations, strange frames and an empty story. <br /><br />Even though all the cast is pretty good and the plot appealing (a drama of cheating between longtime friends), unfortunately, they are helpless to save the movie.<br /><br />What you see is actually characters talking about their past, with dialogs beginning with "Do you remember" or "Whats's going on". OK, the two friends are so closed since childhood that this past means a lot in their adult life. <br /><br />But, a movie is by nature visual, catching what happens in front of the camera. When there are only abusive close ups of endless speeches, you don't got anything. <br /><br />It would have been a better choice to shoot all those past stories instead of hearing them.<br /><br />In conclusion, movies have their rules. Don't apply them and the audience will leave.
