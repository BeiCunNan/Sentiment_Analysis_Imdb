Pretty simple: Why can't Hollywood make a movie with positive Asian roles? <br /><br />This movie has so many stereotypes it makes my stomach churn. And for what purpose? To tell a story so that the white guy looks good? It even makes a few outdated stereotypical references to "Empress Dowager" and "Special Fortunes (cookies)". Blech!<br /><br />Production values are pretty good except for the fact there aren't any subtitles. I like the shot where instead of showing the manager's reaction, we see his hand fall by the doorknob. Musical accompaniment evokes empathic feelings for the central character Lee, especially at the end. <br /><br />Back to the main point: There aren't any positive Asian imagery, particularly for Asian males. Every Chinese person in this movie is either poor (Lee, the cook, & the busboy) or an a**hole (just about everyone else).<br /><br />Why can't Hollywood make a movie with positive Asian roles?
