This was a very creative cartoon for the early 1930s! The hateful musician father owl waits for his wife to give birth to baby musician owls. 3 of them sing or play instruments. But one owl sings "I Love To Singa." The mother owl faints. The father owl puts him out. Then he ends up on a 1930s version of the Gong Show, Showtime At The Apollo like radio show. There is a hateful bunny gonging bad talent and making them fall through the stage. There is an overweight chicken who is too fat to fall through the stage, so she gets shoved through the stage. Then the baby owl sings his song and puts a smile on the hateful bunny's face. Then his parents show up and he sings a sadder song. The hateful bunny is about to gong him off until he gets back to singing "I Love To Singa" and wins first prize. Look for clips from this movie on the movie "Looney Tunes Back In Action."
