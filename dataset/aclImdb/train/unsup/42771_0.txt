Yes I remember going to a country drive-in to see this movie. Vampire Slayer.So what if it was school holidays. I was not going to miss this. Well sad to say it was a crummy C-Grade. 3/10 ..Years later we got a second installment .Well just as before I had to see it.Groan..I didn't expect the "sequel" to be any different (but wait what a difference time makes ) low and behold my current favorite TV serial was born. I am glad some-one saw promise in this old C-Grade movie.Cause I never would have!
