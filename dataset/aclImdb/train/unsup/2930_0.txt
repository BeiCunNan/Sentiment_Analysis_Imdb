This was a fine example of a British film, well acted and directed, an excellent storyline and no slip ups or confusion as sometimes arises in plots like this. Herbert Lom gives a spellbinding performance as the twins, and the rest of the cast are marvellous too. Everyone gives 100% and we enjoyed it very much. It should have got some awards. Please do watch it, if you get the chance. you wont be disappointed. A fine cast of actors doing a brilliant job with a first class director. Superb. I had not been aware of this director before and as he wrote the script too, (oh yes, I forgot to say excellent script) he has excelled himself. Why no proper recognition ? I had not even heard of this film before. It was shown at a quarter to three in the morning! The photography was well done and the matching was excellent too. This film should be acknowledged as a classic British film.
