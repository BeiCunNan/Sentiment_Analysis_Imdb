A group of people gathered on an isolated island filming a mystery movie fall prey to a killer who dispatches of them according to the movies murders. Brief, fast paced thriller with some scares, some good gore, and a clever premise (remind anyone of Scream 2?), doesn't try to pretend it is anything by a mindless slaughter of young people. Rated R; Graphic Violence, Nudity, Sexual Situations, and Profanity.
