I just watched this movie today on cable and was pleasantly surprised. Not being a big fan of Pierce Brosnan, I was a bit apprehensive to even watching this movie. However, the movie started at a nice pace and continued that way throughout, making it very entertaining.<br /><br />Brosnan and Selma Hayek are diamond thieves and lovers. Woody Harrelson is an FBI agent who is duped by Brosnan and Hayek and they become his "white whale." The thieves disappear to the Bahamas to retire. Harrelson then catches up to them because a cruise ship is in port that is displaying one of the world's largest diamonds. Don Cheadle, a local mob boss, then attempts to hire Brosnan to steal the diamond for him.<br /><br />The movie is then a series of cat and mouse type charades between Brosnan, Hayek, Harrelson, and Cheadle. The acting is great from all these stars; Harrelson and Cheadle are both hilarious. Also, Naomie Harris absolutely sizzles in her role as local Bahamian cop and love interest to Harrelson.<br /><br />If you like light-hearted thrillers with a little romance thrown in, you will enjoy this film. Perhaps one of the greatest attractions is the locations; filmed in the beautiful Bahamas. Rating 8 of 10 stars.
