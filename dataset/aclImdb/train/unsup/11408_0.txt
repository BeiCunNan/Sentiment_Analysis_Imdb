I love this movie, Clint Eastwood is fantastic. It's a very dark, mysterious movie set mostly at night. Within the adult scene in 80's New Orleans. With Clints character's sexual cravings he begins to cross the killers domain and realises the killer is not only very much in touch with him, but similar to his desires in many ways. It's a great story, simple stalker type movie but done superbly. Twists and turns throughout the film. It's a forgotten or perhaps not known very well Eastwood gem, not a dirty harry shoot em up though, a more dark, personal film involving Clints life orientating between father to his girls and his seedy sexual desires in the night of New Orleans, to his non stop crusade to bring a dark and mysterious stalker to justice. A wonderful film, great acting and suspense throughout. Very enjoyable. 10 out of 10
