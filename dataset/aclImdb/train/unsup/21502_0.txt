Holy crap, this is the funniest movie ever made, and my number #3 favorite movie of all time (second to The Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers, of course). What a heck of a cast! Martin Short, Dennis Quaid, and Meg Ryan are some of my favorite actors/actresses. How can you watch Martin Short get drunk in Tuck's office and not laugh?! Twistin the Night Away! BABEEEE! I am gonna buy the freakin thing someday, but nobody sells it! It must be one of those hard-to-find classics. Anyone who watches Innerspace and doesn't laugh, they don't know what humor is. Ya'll.
