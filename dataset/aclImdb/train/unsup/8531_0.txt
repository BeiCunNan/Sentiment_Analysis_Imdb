For the life of me, I still can't figure out why Traitor is getting such poor promotion, but if I were the studio I'd be trying my damnedest to get people into the theatre to this. It has got a great cast in Guy Pearce, Jeff Daniels and the lead role by Don Cheadle. Don't be fooled by the commercials that say that "Traitor is this year's Bourne Ultimatem", because this is clearly not true. While there is plenty of mystery and conspiracy to go around, this is a completely different situation that really makes the viewer think at the end of the movie. The great thing about Traitor is the fact that politics aren't heavy-handed or one-sided a la Syriana or any of the other cookie cutter political thrillers out there. The film really allows the viewer to draw their one conclusions based their own individual moral compass. I would say that anyone who is NOT looking for just another Michael Bay-esquire popcorn flick should totally love Traitor.<br /><br />-J.
