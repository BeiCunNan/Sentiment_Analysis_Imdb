** spoilers** Yikes.. what a piece of mush. Elevating the original event that much more aloft. Good old Nick's got that sad eye look on his face and Ryan acts like a dingbat here. Gives me the chills.<br /><br />And the angels stands on top like statues or batman on top of the towers.<br /><br />this reminds me that almost (85-90%) every modern (post 70's) Hollywood film have a very similar style in pacing and editing. It's as if the director/editor came from the same school. The story and the characters moves along like a bell curve to the 3 revolving doors ending : tame, lame or happy.<br /><br />I had this at 6/10 .. but what was I thinking. Go see the original.
