It goes without saying that this film is a total "Witness" ripoff, except now the tough-guy cop is a woman (Griffith) and the religious setting is within the Hasidic Jewish community instead of the Amish. Oh yeah, and the difference in acting (i.e. "Witness"= superb, "Stranger"stinko).<br /><br />The first scene shows Emily Eden (Griffith)and her partner in front of a club, reminiscing about their "rock" days, and how bad they are. They're apparently waiting for some thugs to walk into the bar to arrest them. Once the said thugs arrive, they follow them at about six feet behind, yelling about "back-up", and apparently the thugs are so dense, they don't hear them and bolt. Eden's partner ends up getting knifed as he cuffs the guy while winking at her (saucy!), and ends up half comatose in ER. 10 minutes into the movie, you begin to envy him.<br /><br />This movie was poorly written, directed and acted. We cannot buy Griffith as a tough talking rebel cop with that Betty Boop voice of hers, and it's easy to see why "Stranger Among Us" is one of the top 10 "butt of movie jokes" films of all time.
