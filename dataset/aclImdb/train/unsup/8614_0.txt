I must say that I was very skeptic about this movie, especially after I watched Cinderella 2, which was really not very good. But this movie has that Disney spirit, and the songs sang by the characters from the cartoon, which is really rare in Disney's new cartoons, and I miss that. The plot is interesting, and it's also very funny, I was laughing really hard on some of the scenes. The only flaw of the movie is that it completely ignores the sequel that was made before. So this is more like Cinderella 1 1/2 than Cinderella 3, because it clearly ignores some things that happened in Cinderella 2. Anyway, all the fans of Disney should watch this cartoon, they won't regret it!
