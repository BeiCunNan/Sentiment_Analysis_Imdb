Much better than I expected, especially for the paltry $500K it was suppose to cost.<br /><br />Compared to other movies without big dollars or big names, it was much better than those were.<br /><br />But the content was what I really enjoyed. I loved how they treated the subject. Neale Donald Walsch was surprisingly very good as the lead actor!<br /><br />The direction kept the movie fast paced and all of the plot elements were covered by the end. some of my friends wanted it to go on.<br /><br />I would have liked to have a bit more background on the Indigo children too.
