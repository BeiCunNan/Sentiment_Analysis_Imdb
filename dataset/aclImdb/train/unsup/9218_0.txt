Turn back! Avert your eyes! You have the wrong idea! This movie is just an hour-and-a-half long after school special. They should never have given this movie this title. They only did so to lure unsuspecting youth into concerning themselves with its content, only to disappoint you into watching a hammy story with no real plot twists and pseudo-Christian morals galore. I'm almost positive this movie's production was sponsored by some right-wing-mothers-against-some-thing type of organization. Poor quality and poor story only compounds the fact that it is a total lie. Thank god I pirated it. I give this a big 10 on the Delete Factor. rm -f /The.Anarchist.Cookbook.Movie.avi or Drag and drop it directly to the trash bin of your choice.
