The reason this film is so good is because it is a simple film with a simple message: (For most people) Life isn't easy...things don't just land in your lap. You have to work damn hard and if you are lucky you will be successful. And if you are successful, you might even be happy. Which is wonderful! Not to say people don't find happiness without success and money.... but by god it helps! :) Will Smith is fantastic. I've always been a fan but never really considered him to be a great actor, more a great entertainer. I always thought that he was on screen how he is in real life and never really had to try too hard at acting. This film proved me wrong. He is a brilliant actor in a brilliant role with a brilliant son who is also.. brilliant! This film isn't something that will change your life or be considered amongst the great films but if you want to watch a great story acted well then this is the film for you.<br /><br />It is not as sad as everyone makes out. Yes I bawled my eyes out whilst watching it but it's not the saddest story ever: there are worse things happening in the world than people who can't afford their rent. But let's not get political.<br /><br />Cracking film. Go and see it. My guess is that Will Smith will be pipped at the Oscar post by Peter O'Toole (if they are both nominated) but he won't care.
