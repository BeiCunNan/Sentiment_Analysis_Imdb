The storyline of this movie was close to the biblical story of Exodus. There were certain embellishments, as to be expected.<br /><br />The animation was not all that great. The effects of the parting of the Red Sea was good, but the general drawing of the people in the story left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />The music was, in my opinion, the weakest link in this movie. I honestly could not tell you a single line from any song. It was very forgettable -- and rather contrived. For no apparent reason, a song would break out.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this was a good movie. It is nice to be able to go to a movie and not be assaulted by vulgarity or sexuality thrown in just to appeal to the masses. I liked the fact that part of the believer's heritage is written about in the mainstream media.<br /><br />Overall, this movie got an 8 from me.
