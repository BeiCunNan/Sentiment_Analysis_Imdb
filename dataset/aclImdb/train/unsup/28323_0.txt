This is a fair to reasonable movie about a recluse experiencing strange sights and phenomenon in her apartment. How can she leave when she's more terrified of going out? Claustrophobic in its execution, it turns into a ghost story instead of delving into whether the things happening or just illusions are just in her mind, but therein is the motivation of the script. Where it falls apart for me is the introduction of the pseudo-intellectual ghost-hunter more interested in selling gear and a lot of paranormal mishmash, none of which makes sense or is close to the real thing, but then for the sake of story-telling, film-makers rarely care about keeping it real. Cute and attractive, Jillian Byrnes gives a very good performance, and the directing style keeps in atmosphere throughout, but like I said, it is only in the plot and how believable it is that I find fault. Does the movie have its scares? Yes, but they are from the talent of the director working with the material given him by the writer.
