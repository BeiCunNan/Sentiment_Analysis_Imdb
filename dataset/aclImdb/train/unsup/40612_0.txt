Seeing a sequel is not always the best option. When you see a movie for the first time, it is usually good, but when a part two is released I become a skeptic about weather or not the sequel will be any good. After all the first movie was good, why wouldn't the sequel be? Since I am a big Eddie Murphy fan I like to see all of the movies that he plays a role in, and I recently saw the sequel to Dr. Dolittle 2, directed by Steve Carr (III). A great comedy focused on animals, and a Dr. played by Eddie Murphy who can hear what they are thinking to themselves. A great big bear who is a circus bear, but would like to be free, and find love. Dolittle and his family take a vacation to a cabin in the woods where the bear would be set free; however the bear begins to realize that the wilderness is not "his cup of tea", and wants to be back at the circus. The plot of the movie is all about this bear, and his daughter played by Kristen Wilson finds out that she too has a special gift like that of her father.(Eddie Murphy) It is a great sequel, just as good as the first. Eddie Murphy is a great actor in yet another great movie.
