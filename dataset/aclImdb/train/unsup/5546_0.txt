Just dreadful "comedy" about two young men who pretend to be gay to avoid being drafted.<br /><br />The comedy is horrible--very childish and stupid. The view of gays is simply unbearable--all limp-wristed, mincing, lisping men. Basically this film reinforces every single gay stereotype known to man. As a gay man I got so offended I had to stop watching half way through. It doesn't help that the print I saw had color that was so faded it looked like the film was in b&w.<br /><br />I suppose, in a way, this is useful in a historical context (i.e. to show how negatively gays were thought of in the late 60s). But its entertainment value is nil and it's so incredibly offensive it makes "Boys in the Band" look like an uplifting, liberating gay movie.<br /><br />For gay film completists only but be warned again...the view of gays here is deplorable.
