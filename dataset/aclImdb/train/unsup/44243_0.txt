Truly appalling This is an action movie by numbers... but the action isn't very exciting and the plot holes just annoy. For example, when rehashing the well worn cliche of hero deals with gang on bus, the violence is totally disproportionate to what the gang has done......and these little explosive devices that magically only take out one person (even knowing which way round they hold a saucer) are frankly dull<br /><br />A bad plot with terrible acting and only semi-amusing stunts
