Dinner With Friends is perhaps one of the best written plays about marriage & the reaction of one couple when there best friends split up.<br /><br /> Dennis Quaid & Andie Mc Dowell are a happily (even tho they squabble a lot) married couple. Dave Kineer & Toni Collete are there best friends who are going to get a divorce. We find out all about why this is occuring & the reactions of each couple as they go there separate ways, The acting is near flawless. Norman Jewison directed, & he always gets the best out of him performers. Since this is an adult comedy drama, it is not recommended for youngsters, it has no action & is too mature for them. The only others in the cast are the couples children & they are nicely portrayed. a **** rating from me. This is on HBO only, at the present time, & is another winner from them<br /><br />as always Jay Harris<br /><br />
