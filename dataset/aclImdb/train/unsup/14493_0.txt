The movie is delicate and the choreography's are amazing. It might not be perfect but many people vote it without any dance knowledge.<br /><br />I loved to see that she used Brazilian music, which is great. Also the courage of Lisa Niemi to produce this movie with a very low budget deserves a lot of credit. Fortunately I could find it here in Brazil and appreciate it. I hope it gets everywhere so people that loves dance can see a very nice movie that goes a little bit different from the many clich√©s of struggle beginners.<br /><br />The scene where they are warm up and the fog starts, really gives us the impression that the entire room is boiling.<br /><br />It is a pity that we cannot see the complete choreography of Without a Word. That was the only promise that the movie did not accomplished.
