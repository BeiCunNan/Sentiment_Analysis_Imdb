I saw this film just the other day, sitting underneath the stars in a park with loads of other people, watching the movie on a big screen. There is absolutely nothing like it in the world to be able to enjoy a movie with others. This film is amazing in the way that it can get everybody up and dancing; you should have seen and heard our rousing rendition of "You're the One That I Want", it was beautiful. I think that the casting in the film is superb, and the songs are great too.<br /><br />We all know how successful "Grease" has been, it is a movie that has stood the test of time, and I love it. Sure, some parts do drag on a little bit, especially, "Hopelessly Devoted to You" which always gets on my nerves for some reason, but other than that, it's a great way to spend an evening. Although it does look dated, the story is timeless and will always be used in films. The dance routines, the songs, everything is amazing. My favourite scene has to be the finale, as it's a really uplifting song and a good old happy ending which makes you go away with a big smile on your face.
