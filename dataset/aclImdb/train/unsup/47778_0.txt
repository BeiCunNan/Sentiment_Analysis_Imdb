I Love You Alice B Toklas may have been cutting edge social commentary in 1968 but now it looks as weary and worn out as its dramatic counterpart, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. By the time you've heard Harper's Bizarre sing the title tune for the third time you'll want to strangle 'em. Sellers is reasonably good, though he tends to rely too much on the vocal tics that were his Achilles heel throughout his career. Better than The Guru, but not by much.
