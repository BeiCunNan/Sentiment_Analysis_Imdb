I believe I'm one of the few people who are huge fans of this movie. It's not a great movie but it excels in it's 1980's cheesy-ness. Forget John Hughes and St. Elmo's Fire, if you are looking for the quintessential teen movie, it's Zapped. Scott Baio gets hit on the head and gets telekenisis powers, Willie Ames is with him as always, Scatman Crothers gets high and rides a bike through a field, girls shirts rip off. I have devoted my life to make sure as many people see this movie as possible. And the song they play at the prom, "Got To Believe In Magic" by David Pomeranz. It's beautiful, I've used it in video projects and a play I directed. It's a horrible movie but it's not in the so bad it's good category. It's a movie I can watch repeatedly and enjoy even though it is pretty bad. Stay away from the sequel you will only get scorned.
