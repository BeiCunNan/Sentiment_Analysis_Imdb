Heaven and hell are fighting over a soul once again, and of course they send their representatives over to Earth to try and make the soul go in the "right" direction. The soul in question is a has-been boxer Many, who for much of the movie is uninteresting and unappealing. The agents from Heaven and Hell happen to be women, and the two otherworldly planes and their agents have been modernized, using cell phones and operating like modern businesses. No, it is not at any point for, new or imaginative.<br /><br />There is only one interesting turn of the plot the movie, and it's more of a sidenote, not elaborated on in the least. The majority of the movie is spent on absolutely nothing. The angels never get a good fight going, there never seems to be any actual battle for the soul which is supposed to be ultimately important. No, I'm not referring to actual physical battles, rather to battles of wills. Instead, there is an absolutely needless and gratuitous bloodbath near the end of the movie.<br /><br />Add in a highly questionable note that women are of a lesser value than men, and you have Sin noticias de Dios: an absolutely uninspiring and boring movie without pretty much any content at all. Agustín Díaz Yanes as the director and writer is completely lost on what makes an interesting and appealing movie, and as a result of his ineptitude, the actors are fumbling on screen as well without any personality to show. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities in the film at all. If Hell existed, this movie would be going to the lowest levels.
