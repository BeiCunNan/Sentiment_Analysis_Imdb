I just got back from the con movie/drama/mystery/romance/comedy, The Brothers Bloom, and I got to tell you, it's one of the best films so far this year. Adrien Brody and Mark Ruffalo are excellent as brothers Bloom and Steven. As kids, they were troublemakers getting kicked out of orphan homes because of their appalling behavior. As a kid, Bloom falls in love with a girl. As kids, Bloom and Steven only talked to each other. When Steven realizes Bloom cannot talk to her, he plans a con with the first step being Bloom talks to the girl. Steven ends up making money off this con. Fast-forward to adulthood. Steven thinks up brilliant cons which Bloom participates in. The great thing about the cons in this movie is that the cons are brilliant, but unlike most con movies, the cons are believably brilliant. Rachel Weisz is hilarious as the wacky Penelope, a woman who collects hobbies. When Bloom talks to her, he figures out she has some amazing talents. She participates in the con. The twist is Penelope does not know they are participating in a con. Rinko Kikuchi (she played Chieko Wataya in Babel) is excellent in her almost wordless role as Steven's personal assistant, Bang Bang. This is a fantastic movie with a fantastic mix of genres and a lot of great performances. This movie has something for everyone, so no matter what you do, go see it.
