It's been a very long time since I've seen a movie with my children that did not have to rely on gross-out humor just to get a laugh. "Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles" is a FUN movie.It's fun to let go and get in on the silliness of the jokes. Critics should not be comparing it to the first or even the second Dundee movies. This film is wonderfully different than both of them, and uniquely funny and endearing all on its own. Yes, Paul Hogan's Mick Dundee is still the same--still sweetly naive. Why critics feel the need to rip the character up for that just goes to show how jaded our society has become when people can't appreciate and embrace a quality like that in a film character. I, for one, love that my children can sit and watch a character who is moral, who is loving and attentive to his wife and child, who seeks out new things and learns from them and for the most part who sees the good in people. What's wrong with sending our children THOSE messages?
