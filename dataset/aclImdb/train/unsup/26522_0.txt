When this film came out the idea of massive imprisonments in the US seemed remote. In the past there may have been a will to oppress but it was counter-balanced or diffused by ineffectiveness or inefficiency of the government. Technology has provided athe means; political crises have strengthened the will.<br /><br />In the volitile political climate inside the US one can easily see how a regime could get out of hand and with the use of technology start mass imprisonments and keep inmates in line with thought control and torture, here for a second pregnancy. <br /><br />The danger with making films of this nature is not that it envisions a brave new world which those of good conscience should work to avoid but that it might inspire those personalities like that of Prison Director Poe (Kurtwood Smith) to the means and methods of more effective repression.<br /><br />Do works in the bleak Orwellian futuristic 1984 genre warn or provide a model for action? Is fortress a warning or a prophesy?<br /><br />See the film.
