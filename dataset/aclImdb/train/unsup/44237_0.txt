I've read all the comments posted here and am not surprised to find that almost everyone finds it to be an obnoxious movie. I watched "Passenger 57" first; kept wondering why Snipes was so thug-ish during the whole film, till he walked into the sunlight with the pretty lady. Then, found a VHS of "The Specialist" and subjected myself to another two hours of junk, with "The Italian Stallion". Double UGH ! I think I was so shocked from four hours of this kind of "action" movies, I was paralyzed, unable to get-up and switch from "video" to satellite-TV. Didn't really have to get-up - I could have clicked it all away. Problem is, out of all those satellite-channels, there was nothing good or nothing I hadn't already seen....<br /><br />....I blame myself....<br /><br />I was enlightened with how many users knew so much trivia about "The Specialist". I had never heard of the film; I got a good education on it. $15-mil for Stallone ("Ray Quick") ??? If his career is on the skids, why does he command such a high fee? (Not surprised to learn he has done porn in the past; that's not my being dumb, just haven't been that interested in him since "Rambo".) $45-mil to make the movie? WOW ! Just think how many good things all that money could have done. I didn't see "Anaconda," and am now glad - so, I wasn't aware that Luis Llosa directed both films. I'm not one to worship at directors' doors. One good movie doesn't mean they ALL are going to be good. One-at-a-time, please....<br /><br />For a long time, I've been wondering why actors/actresses think whispering their lines is sexy, or demonstrating they know how to emote. Stallone should have pitched his voice at a higher tone, and stopped trying to get all those weird mouth-movements onto film.<br /><br />On the other hand, James Woods ("Ned Trent") needed a muzzle for his hollering - or someone in the sound-booth to turn-down the volume. I am hoping his beyond-over-the-top screaming was done for camp. The only positive comment I can give for these two actors is, I'm glad age has filled-in their faces....both were always gaunt-looking. I was also surprised to see that Stallone is no taller than Sharon Stone ("Munro-Hastings"). The sex-scene in the shower exposed his backside, no bubble-butt, guys....<br /><br />Let's face it, Stone hasn't done anything good since "Basic Instinct." Her entire career has been one of every actor she's appeared with, with their hands all over (and inside) of her body. "Instinct" was a first-time shocker - enough, already ! I must also comment that micro-mini skirts were not in style for the 90s: a huge, veiled hat and a dress that hardly covered her panties, in a church?<br /><br />Like many, I didn't recognize Rod Steiger ("Joe Leon"). Sad deterioration. I finally remembered Eric Roberts ("Tomas Leon") from "Runaway Train", A "pretty-boy" type he is not....now.<br /><br />"Paul Andrew's" comment says it all for me, although I agree with the majority of the other comments. I don't even consider the few opinions who thought it was the best film ever made - in just the period of the 90s ?? Wow! again...<br /><br />I found no redeeming nor entertaining qualities for "The Specialist," except for how hard the special-effects artists were hitting it, and the pretty colors the explosions made. If this is the best Llosa can do with all that money and directing-scripting, no wonder he isn't getting any work. I found the sets and locations to be colorful, but that doesn't replace a good STORY........the only good thing I found in this movie is, I saw it free......
