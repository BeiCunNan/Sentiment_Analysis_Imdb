Little Britain is just an great show,with brilliant sketches and good jokes.The humor is truly great,with a lot of characters which are again,great.Some people may not like it(Don't like it!) but they should not complain.It is a great show which hopefully will continue for years to come.<br /><br />Matt Lucas and David Walliams are brilliant actors and Little Britain is just one of the greatest comedy-show ever! The new series -Series 3- maybe less great then Series 1 and 2,but its still great.I like the surviving characters the most.My favorite characters:Lou & Andy.These sketches are just a masterpiece. You should watch this.<br /><br />My rating:10/10.
