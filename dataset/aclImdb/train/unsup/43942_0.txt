Ha ha he he he. This is laughable. There is NOTHING worth watching in this pile of badly made cheapo trash. Even if you enjoy a good 'bad' movie (which I am partial to) this should be avoided. The only truly special thing about this film is the incredible soundtrack. Even random music plucked from a library catalogue would have occasionally hit the mark, this is so way off you may think that the guy writing it knew he wasn't going to get paid! <br /><br />The 'story' as such revolves around a typical stalk and slash formula without the benefit of an explanation as to why he's slicing and dicing the 'young' folk.<br /><br />Nudity and cheap effects just don't cut the mustard even in the straight to video days of the 80's.<br /><br />Avoid!
