It would seem that no popular cartoon or comic book hero is safe now. Nothing is sacred! Brian Levant's "The Flinstones" follows a plethora of animated features cum screen sensations from "Batman" to the other recent Hanna and Barbera production, "The Jetsons".<br /><br />Though that well loved space age family did maintain its animated status, "the modern stone age family" was not as fortunate. John Goodman, reputedly at the insistence of Steven Spielberg, got the choice role of Fred, the great big lovable oaf who has a heart that's every bit as soft as his head. Elizabeth Perkins plays stern wife Wilma, Rick Moranis is old pal Barney Rubble, and comedienne Rosie O'Donnell ("A League of Their Own") is Barney's wife Betty.<br /><br />While everybody looks the part, and no expense has been spared in re-creating Bedrock, none of the characters are ever interesting enough to hold your attention for more than ten minutes. The cartoon-esqe plot, with villains Cliff Van der Cave (Kyle MacLachlan) and sidekick secretary Stone (Halle Berry) framing Fred for embezzling, is painfully stretched out for ninety or so minutes with the assistance of a subplot involving the Rubbles' adoption of a darling little Neanderthal named "Bamm-Bamm". In fact the only interesting and genuinely entertaining character is Fred's talkative piece of office equipment, the "Dictabird" (voiced by Harvey Korman).<br /><br />All this is not to say that Brian Levant has let us down, as he has been very true to the original 60's cartoon series, and both Jim Henson's creature creations and William Sandell's production design are a credit to their collective geniuses. However there is very little one can do with a show that was never really meant to leave the T.V. set.<br /><br />I guess the novelty wears off all too quickly, unless you're a "Flinstones" freak or a minor. Look out for cult rock group the B-52's, appearing as the BC52's. Also an enjoyable guest appearance from Liz Taylor.<br /><br />Thursday, September 22, 1994 - Balwyn Cinema
