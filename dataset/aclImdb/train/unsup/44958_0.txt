Apparently one of the ways you can choose to die when you're sentenced to death is to watch this movie. No one has chosen this route because it too painful a way to go.<br /><br />This movie is really bad. It should in fact be banned. The video store where I rented this from should really keep movies like this behind the counter, anyone could just pick it up, and rent it.<br /><br />Basic story.. Underdogs who can't surf have a week to learn how to surf and beat REAL surfers who probably have been surfing all their lives, at the World High School surf championships in Costa Rica. And there seems to only be 3 teams that enter this contest. The local team from Costa Rica. Laguna Beach Team B(<----underdogs) and Laguna Beach Team A (The bad-guys).<br /><br />This movie sucks so much I can't believe I'm using more then 3 paragraphs to let you know how much it sucks. There's notions of bestiality, lame fart jokes (I thought that fart jokes are alway funny.... I've found a movie where it's not), and a pretty crappy brave-heart imitation. Something about "You can take our lives, but you can't take our SPIRIT!!!). This movie should really be banned. After I've finished this "review" I'm starting a web site where people sign a petition to get crap like this outlawed. If I could give this movie a minus score, I would.<br /><br />Don't watch it, please, I beg you.... you'll thank me later
