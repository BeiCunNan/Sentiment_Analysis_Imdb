I disagree with the last review about the movie being original, as it seems more of a whimsical version of 'Went the Day Well?.<br /><br />The cast are as stiff as a Huns helmet. Caine hardly moves his neck, is he acting or went to bed in an odd position? When the German stars playing with his organ in the church it becomes all too obvious this was supposed to be a send-up.<br /><br />I tried the whistling trick with two rottweilers & ended up with my left arm amputated below the elbow & months of rehabilitation, I tried it again with two Yorkshire terriers & ended up with a missing testical.<br /><br />Anyway when seeing this when it first came out it already seemed dated & cheesy.<br /><br />I think most of the 'Carry On" cast were still alive at the time & would have been a great help/support in bringing a giggle to this long slow movie.<br /><br />An opportunity missed alas. Oooh vicar
