I find this movie to be really funny on many, many levels. Sure, I think it's a bit much at times, but there are so many great moments in this movie! Also, it reminds me of my college days as both a punk and a theatre major who partied way too much with way too many weird people like Gnome. I guess it's all this truth that I see within this movie that draws me to it, and I frankly enjoy the inner-dialogs. It's evidence of the naive yet self-centered people we were at the time.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good movie that doesn't demand too much of your own psyche to understand it, then give this movie a watch - besides, Donal Logue's performance is NOT to be missed! He has the best part in the entire movie.<br /><br />Does anyone know if they filmed this in Vancouver?
