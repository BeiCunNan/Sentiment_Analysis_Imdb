Finally, a movie with socially important messages. Yes, it is devoid of violence and vulgarity. Really beautiful settings and magnificent animals. This leaves viewers with a sense of hope and promise. Predictable? yes but so well crafted. The acting was very good and believable. Comning from a family with a small farm, and having a father that too put his hope and faith in race horses, I really connected. Famileis will find many lessons and can use them to make their own lives happier and more complete. I would recommend this to anyone wanting clean entertainment and good feelings. I believe that life can really be this way.
