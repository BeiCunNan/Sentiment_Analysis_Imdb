I read the reviews of this movie before watching, and honestly I was confident that I would like the movie despite the overwhelming bad reviews. After all, folks were very hard on the Riddick series of which I am a big fan. I also really enjoy watching Vin Diesel. In my opinion, he has the kind of screen presence to make great movies. He also fits well with the sci-fi genre because he plays mysterious characters so well.<br /><br />However, the bad reviews for this movie are really true. The movie makes almost no sense. I appreciate when some movies wait to fully explain things in the end, but this movie makes one feel like an explanation is coming at some point -- yet it never comes. At the end of this movie I was truly dumbfounded. It was like reading a book that had pages ripped out of it. I feel so cinematically violated. Better luck next time Vin. You're a great actor in my opinion, and I hope to see you in more great sci-fi.
