Half the actors mailed in their performance, the other half couldn't act. Cheesy beyond belief. Horrible plot. The relationships between the characters aren't fully developed or explained. Don't even let me get started on the complete lack of any real scientific reality. I know it is a B-Movie, but at least make it plausible.<br /><br />Rutger proves yet again that he is if anything, utterly incapable of picking a real role. He must have been lucky with Blade Runner. He totally mails in this one. Guess he was looking for a paycheck.<br /><br />It was so bad I just had to sit through it for the sheer joy of seeing ineptness in action. If you like to see really really bad movies... this one is for you.
