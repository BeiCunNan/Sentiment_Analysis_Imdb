I first seen this film in the early 80's and i loved it, its a real tearjerker and any chick flick fans out there will surely enjoy this film, i never get bored watching this film, but get the box of tissue's at the ready :)<br /><br />Rex plays the part of a 17 year old guitar instructor named Michael and a 13 year old girl named Jessie falls for him, she manages to get his attention and they fall in love, he thinks she's 16 years old as thats what she told him, but you'll have to watch the movie for yourself to see what happens when Michael finds out Jessie's real age, a highly recommended film.
