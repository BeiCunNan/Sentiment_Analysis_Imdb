A few weeks ago they started to show reruns of the flying doctors here on TV and I couldn't be happier about that. Every Saturday-evening I'm hooked again. I used to watch this show as a young teenager every week and now I'm watching it every week as a young adult and I'm still loving it.<br /><br />It's very exciting and has some great acting. It's a kind of show where you really start to care about the major characters. The pacing sometimes is a bit slow, but I don't mind at all. This way you can really get sucked into the story and start to know and care about the people involved. Something which doesn't happen in most shows nowadays. I really hope that the reruns are going to last a long time, because The flying doctors is really a one-of-a-kind great show.
