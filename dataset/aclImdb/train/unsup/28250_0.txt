Well that was probably the idea when Japan created the character back in the 50's. The character keeps getting brought through the 60's to the 80's, and now it's 2009.<br /><br />Set in the future, a scientist(voiced by Nicolas Cage) is drowning in sadness, cause he lost his son(voiced by Freddie Highmore) in a laboratory accident, almost a year later he builds a robotic replica of his son(also Freddie Highmore). But when he turns out to smart for his own, The scientists starts to feel guilty for trying to play god, and demands he be taking away. But the boy discovers he is not quite like other boys. He hears what they said, and he quickly runs away. And tries to get used to being a robot, during that he comes some outcast kids at a junk yard, he soon becomes apart of there family, but does not tell them he's a robot, cause he doesn't want to feel like a freak. He also gets the name Astro. But what happens when an evil pollition(voiced by Donald Sutherland) slowly closes in on him? <br /><br />Awesome animation, since The Incredibles and Meet the Robinsons. And such great actors doing awesome voice over. Astro Boy is really a must see for kids and adults.
