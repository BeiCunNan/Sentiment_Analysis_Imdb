This movie was almost unwatchable... the only thing that keeps you from banging your head against the remote is that you want to see the "were-crocodile" for the laugh itself.... It had the clich√© "token black guy" (in the Pacific Northwest.. yea!!! We'll stay away from there then, lol...) with the farmer's daughter white girl. They can never act either, they just have to be "black", and half the time they can't even pull that off.... (See Get Rich or Die Trying' for an example, he couldn't even play himself convincingly).... of course all the typical stuff is here, but in bad taste.... Lakes, woods, naked chicks, pot, camping, full moons, about the only thing they missed was rain... Garbage.
