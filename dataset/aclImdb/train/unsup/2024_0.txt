So Close is nothing like Charlie's Angels. Three beautiful women in the lead, two of them contract killers and one police. There is some drama-plot involved but that doesn't hold too well. Sometimes there are a few silly minor things but all in all the movie was very entertaining. Fight choreography was at least very interesting and quite original.<br /><br />Rating: 7/10<br /><br />
