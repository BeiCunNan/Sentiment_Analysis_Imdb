Stand out to me in this episode was always Phyllis Douglas as Yeoman Mears.<br /><br />Why was she on the shuttle? A quick check to see what else she had done, surprise, surprise, she is in Gone With the Wind as baby Bonnie Blue Butler.<br /><br />Scarlett and Rhett's prized baby girl. It is to laugh.<br /><br />Near 30 years on, she is tangling with a Vulcan.<br /><br />This episode should also be noted as not following thru with the incorrect notion that all the guys in the red shirts are killed (both victims of the planet's monsters wore yellow shirts) and likewise the equally inexplicable idea that all the black guys were killed (the minority in this case survived).<br /><br />In truth, this episode watches like a strange predecessor to the disaster movie; who will survive, who will die? The three cast members will survive, the woman should survive so there won't be any calls of unfairness to women and Don Marshall should survive, which he did.<br /><br />Not a bad episode, actually.<br /><br />Wish there had been more episodes with Phyllis Douglas in them tho.
