The movie diverges sharply from the short story by Henry Kuttner, and falls prey to every single ET-based clich√©, complete with floating objects and overzealous FBI agents, ancient Tibetan prophecies, etc. <br /><br />The original story was more akin to "Childhood's End", whereas the writers decided that every movie must have good guys and bad guys, and a crisis and a phony car chase. This results in a story that feels forced and fake, without any flow or sense. At many times I felt that items were "pasted on" in failed attempts to create humor or tension, but they were silly.<br /><br />Give this one a miss.
