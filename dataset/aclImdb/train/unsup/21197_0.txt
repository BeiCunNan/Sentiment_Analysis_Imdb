this is kind of a spin off of fatal fury. here, we have a big corporation, weird loves between family members, and generous jiggilation from the babes. now, i know this isn't a very good title, but its fun to watch when you get the chance. the animation is good, the story is ok, and the fighting scenes are radical. overall, this is a title to see, but probably not to own.
