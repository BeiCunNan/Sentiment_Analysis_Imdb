this is the only show ( at least i watched until now ) that not only helps to know how our favorite stars are... but also helps to develop the craft for professionals ( being and wanted to be ) and know the difficulty of the craft for non-professionals, you may ask why general public should know how difficult the craft is and that is because they are the people who comments ( usually bad ) on them.<br /><br />i really admire James Lipton a lot , i never admired a interviewer before. what i really like him about, is the way he presents himself dominating even in front of legends. i really show my gratitude for that kind of admiring attitude.<br /><br />i recommend " 100th guest special " show ( if u have not seen )bec it is the only show where u can clearly understand how actors are.., i mean he complete mixture of sentiments, humor, professionalism, attitude, he way they were, etc.., and for general audience, it is Aone ENTERTAINMENT, especially when they show JULIA ROBERTS in between smiling, VOW... the amount i like is just doubled like hell, vow, hats off to Julia Roberts, well not only that, u will be finding your own favorite stars doing stuffs like that especially KEVIN SPACEY, STEVEN SPIELBERG, ROBIN WILLIAMS, JERRY LEWIS, man the list goes on...<br /><br />great TV show - inside the actors studio <br /><br />inside the actors studio's best - 100 guest special<br /><br />continue enjoying the show<br /><br />see u guys...
