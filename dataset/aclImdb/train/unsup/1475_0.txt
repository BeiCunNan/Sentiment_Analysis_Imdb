Saw the movie, and up to the point,where the 2 Guys in the Ferrari show up it's good...but then... The Jaguar's brakes stop working he crashes in the back of the Ferrari, speeds up again and crashes again...come on! Never heard of an N or Handbrake? = Faild in the 1st Driving-Lesson...and then, just to top the Joke...Terry comes back...Is this a joke review of the 1st Scenes, where they where sitting in the Cinema (I think it was Jason) The last 10Min. spoilt the whole movie. Trash.
