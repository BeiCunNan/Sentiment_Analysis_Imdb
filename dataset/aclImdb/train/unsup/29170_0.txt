Every day from school, from 1991-1993, I would always run home from school to see the latest episode of Darkwing Duck. This action-adventure-comedy was the highlight of my youth. Back then, I loved the characters (especially Steelbeak and Darkwing himself), the majority of the story lines and the good IL' classic Disney feel that somehow lacks in today's Disney shows. The villains were always interesting, and the shows humor wasn't centered on bathroom humour, unlike a number of new animated shows.<br /><br />Twelve years later, after finding some taped episodes, I am still in love with this wonderful show and glad to see there are lots of devoted fans out and about. I hope to see it returned to its former glory in some form or another.
