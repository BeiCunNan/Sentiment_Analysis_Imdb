Pretty Cool Too made me laugh. It's campy comedy with nudity. That's a winning formula in my book. Plenty of babes run wild on camera. Many of them are head turners. My favorite was Jennifer Day. She is the cat's meow. If I ever saw director Rolfe Kanefsky in a bar I would buy them a beer and say I was a fan. Once again my GF complained that Pretty Cool Too was mindless nudity in a plot less movie. She has poor taste in movies. She thought Animal House was stupid. Pretty Cool Too has plenty of laughs and nudity if you are in to that sort of thing l am. Rolfe Kanefsky wasn't trying to make Ghandi. This is a great rent when you want to tune in and tune out without having to think to much.
