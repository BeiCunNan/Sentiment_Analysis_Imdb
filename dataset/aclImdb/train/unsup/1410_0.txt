Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff star in this atmospheric thriller. Lugosi is effective as Dr. Vitus Werdegast and Karloff is diabolically evil as the satanic Hjalmar Poelzig. David Manners and Jaqueline Wells co-star as two American honeymooners caught in the conflict between Lugosi and Karloff. The camera angles and lighting make up for the lacking plot line. The dialogue is laughable at times, but the actors manage to hold their faces straight while saying it and do a pretty good job with the rest of the film. Joan and Pater Allison(Manners and Wells) are vacationing on their honeymoon in Europe. They run into Dr. Werdegast on a train and decide to share a cab to a town. Along the way the driver crashes the car and the four survivors(Werdegast's servant survived as well) head to a house that Werdegast knows. It is the house of Hjalmar Poelzig, an old acquaintance of Werdegast's. As the night and next morning ensue, Werdegast's and Poelzig's sordid past is revealed, and Poelzig also decides that he must have Joan for a satanic ritual. The finale is explosive as Werdegast makes his last stand against Poelzig and the honeymooners try to escape from danger. This film co-stars Harry Cording(A universal regular) as Werdegast's sidekick, a very attractive Lucille Lund as Poelzig's innocent wife, and Egon Brecher as Poelzig's servant. 8/10
