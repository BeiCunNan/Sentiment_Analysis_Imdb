Don Coscarelli's original PHANTASM is one of the best horror/sci-fi movies of all time. I'm not going to just reiterate the story like every other post out there has done. All I'm going to say is, if you have any imagination at all you're going to love this film! This is the one that introduced the killer spheres from which the other films in the series have elaborated upon. PHANTASM is an atmospheric thriller that will make you jump, laugh and possibly scream. The music is excellent as well. If you've only seen an old, crappy video rental and dismissed this as "some lame 70s flick" then you have not experienced the glory that is<br /><br />PHANTASM. Check out the special edition LD or DVD, then maybe you'll learn to appreciate PHANTASM and give it the respect it deserves. 10 out of 10 - perfect!!!!!!
