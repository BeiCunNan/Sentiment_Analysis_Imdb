This DBZ movie is the best one out of all, and this movie could be used as the soul to a live action movie!! This movie had the best music and action. Other English DBZ movies are good but are better left Japanese, for example; The History of Trunks. FUNimation outdid themselves this time, as this movie is so enjoyable thats its only drawback is that it ended. I could see this as a Live Action movie to see if more would work. Broly himself is an amazing character, as he does a good job pretending to be good then losing it when Kakarot aka Goku shows up. When he and Goku meet face to face, the movie really takes off. This movie is worth everyones time and makes a great source for entertainment.
