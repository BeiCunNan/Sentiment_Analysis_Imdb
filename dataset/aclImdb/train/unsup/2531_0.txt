The main character, Ester, arrives in Hollywood and can not get a job as an actress. Of course it does not help that she has no acting experience. This aspect of the film made it hard to watch at the beginning, but once she makes it the story gets better.<br /><br />I liked the loving relationship she has with her husband and the I also enjoyed the location shots. It is interesting to see what Hollywood/Los Angeles looked like in the 1930's.<br /><br />If you like classic films it is worth renting.
