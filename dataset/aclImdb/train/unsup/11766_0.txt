Now, why would they have a sequel? I'm curious. The family has already had an adventure by saving the dog from the first film. You'd think "OK, they live happily ever after". Nope. <br /><br />LITTLE SPOILERS<br /><br />Beethoven falls for another St. Bernard. And they have puppies together, but Beethoven's girlfriend's master wants the puppies. The kids take the puppies without her permission. And she stalks the family to get the puppies. The family goes on a vacation. The children all learn morals of life. The parents fall in love again. And Beethoven cries over his girlfriend. And the woman happens to bump into them again. I mean, how more silly can you get? What are these family's chances of having to save their dog once again? We'll never know until the third one.<br /><br />2/10
