Very watchable mid period classic hardcore. The mother/son incest theme I can take or leave but it was convincingly done. Kay Parker as the late 30 year old mother was spot on and gives an excellent performance, with and without cock in her mouth. Her son, played by Mike Ranger is fine but looks a little older than the 19 years accredited to him. There is not too much storyline and everyone seems relaxed and happy with their respective roles. Very well paced, there is for once not a scene that outstays its welcome and with varied cinematography and music (occasionally none!) this looks and feels like a laid back late 70s enterprise. Oh, some great shots out on the streets of San Francisco too as a bonus.
