I picked this up at the rare video store on VHS since it seems it's not very well known or even on DVD.<br /><br />It's a surprisingly refreshing Supernatural horror film with elements of the 'Giallo' mixed in. Well directed, even creepy at times it is very interesting.<br /><br />The plot deals with a professor who uncovers a sinister plot. Filled with good camera-work, colorful elaborate lighting and scenes in old city centers of Europe, it is enticing for the horror fan.<br /><br />If you liked this, I'd recommend: Zeder (1983)(aka "Zeder - Voices from Beyond" or "Revenge of the Dead"), The House of the Laughing Windows (1976), Suspiria (1977) and One Dark Night (1983).
