Although I may be ashamed to say it, there was a time in my life where I thought the 3 Ninjas movies rocked. My personal favorites were the first one and the one where they go to Japan. When I finally surpassed that dark age in my childhood, I decided to see one again just for plain stupidity. I noticed all the elements present in a bad movie. Then, Mega Mountain was aired on HBO, years later since the last time, and saw it for whatever reason you could think of that included weed. Stupid jokes, stupid plot, stupid acting, stupid kids making stupid moves to stupid bad guys. That's all there is to it. Just like the previous ones, but this time they step it up a notch, by adding the incredible martial arts moves of that kung fu legend, Hulk Hogan. There were really memorable moments, like the one where a bunch of people puke after riding a ride turned nightmare (actually, they were puking over being extras for this movie). The movie's plot was probably stolen from a rejected script from Beverly Hills Cop 3, and later rewrote to achieve that disgusting kiddy tone. This is an insult to any audience, including babies. You can't even make fun of it while watching it (it's that bad).
