I remember this movie only because my sister and I were the original latch key kids. My older sister and I used to watch TV from the old channel 5 ( pre- Fox network ) TV out of Washington DC. They ran great late afternoon movies and reruns I watched for years before cable. Anyone who grew up in the channel 5 area during the late 60's knows hows what I mean. The Untouchables, Highway Patrol, The Big Valley, Dear Lord where are these great reruns today?? But I digress.. This movie scared the living crap out of me, and I remember my sister teasing me for months. I remember so little about this movie, but it scared me bad enough I've never forgotten the title. Netflix doesn't have this..anyone know where to get a copy of it? I want to face my fear!!
