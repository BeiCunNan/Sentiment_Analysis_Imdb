This is by far the best Poirot of late.<br /><br />The fast-paced, complex plot and exciting cinematography make Taken a far more interesting film than preceding ones which were overly naturalistic and dialogue heavy. Who wants to hear the Hollow's Henrietta discuss what a complex person she is when action and interaction speak louder than words? The actors of Taken are well cast and the characters are great fun to watch. Also, the murder-hook followed by the long question-and-answer routine in many of the previous ones was too linear and formulaic, which makes you question why they were adapted from the book at all. This film mixes it up very nicely, there are no lulls or boring parts that last longer than a couple minutes. This is a film you can watch more than once.<br /><br />The few changes that were made from the book are for the better, especially if you remember how disappointing the very end of the book was. My favorite things about this film is the dramatic flair of the characters and the camera movements as I stated above. A good director can make all the difference.<br /><br />One minor thing that bothers me is that the home version of this film seems to be shortened. For one, the scene with Lynn and Rowley in the kitchen is missing.
