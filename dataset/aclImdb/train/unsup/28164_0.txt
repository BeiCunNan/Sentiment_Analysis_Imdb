i had never watched the south park series before seeing the movie. a friend put the movie on and i was blown away. by the time the first musical number started, i was rolling on the floor laughing. i couldn't believe how smart and stupid it was at the same time. <br /><br />i feel like south park actually explores a lot of social and political issues way more than other serious movies that try to get deep.<br /><br />some of the movie is really really stupid and that is funny. and some of it really does address bigger issues, including censorship, war and religion.<br /><br />somehow fart jokes just make it work. don't ask me why. <br /><br />if you are an independent thinker who likes ridiculous comedy you will love this movie!
