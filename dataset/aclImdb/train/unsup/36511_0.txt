Dinner guests for a professor/archaeologist find out they're on the menu instead when the undead, from a crypt unearthed by their host, come a calling.<br /><br />While this might appeal to zombie fans(..and, from what I hear, this flick has quite a following), I thought it was rather poor with no real explanation as to why the dead would rise and behave in the fashion of George Romero's zombies eating flesh and innards. Bizarre angle where a "young boy" Michael(Peter Bark who actually looks older than the actress portraying his mother)lusts after his mommy Evelyn(Mariangela Giordano, who really loves to widen her eyes)groping her sexually in one scene.<br /><br />The zombies are often merely extras wearing Halloween masks..that's how effective some of them aren't. There are scenes of gut-munching and neck ripping for the fans who desire this sort of thing when they watch their zombie movies. Some nudity and sex. There's no plot to speak of other than one dimensional characters in search of an exit off the grounds of their host's castle with slow zombies lumbering after them.<br /><br />An eerie electronic score(think "Forbidden Planet")does add ambiance where the film often fails to deliver.
