The film was certainly interesting with its use of camera work, funky shots and general creativity, but more often than not, that 'funkiness' was used to excess. Cropped images linked together, lens tricks, and so on distracted from the picture more than aiding it.<br /><br />(Minor spoilers may follow.)<br /><br />The story itself has very little to do with the plot outline as listed on the main details page for this film. The Japanese anime-watching character (Adam Goldberg) was minor in this film. The picture revolved around a metalhead-type loser (Jake Busey) whose dream of being with a porn star (Jennifer Tilly) leads him on a strange road trip after he is dismissed by his girlfriend (Natasha Lyonne). Along the way, he picks up Jules (Crispin Glover, in another obscure yet excellent performance), a bird-loving, awkward man.<br /><br />The writing was at best mediocre. Many portions of the plot which should have been expanded upon were summarily discarded. This is the first thing I have seen from Salome Breziner; if this is any indication of Breziner's style of writing/direction, then I'm not in any rush to see anything else.<br /><br />This was based on a book by Bruce Craven, and perhaps it was just a poor adaptation. Not having read the book beforehand, I just don't know what the main culprit was in this film's set of problems. Regardless, this was not a film I would consider overly enjoyable.<br /><br />*1/2 of ***** for some good work by Eric Roberts, Jennifer Tilly and Crispin Glover.
