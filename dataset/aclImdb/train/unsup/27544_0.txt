While I agree with many of the comments regarding the first few episodes, what most people have missed was the amazing turnaround of this series.<br /><br />First of all, I'm surprised that so many film and sci-fi buffs failed to recognize that despite the show's early rushed production and acting problems, the sound editing and writing are surprisingly good. The show sounds amazing, and the music editing shows what an extremely editor/team can do on a low budget.<br /><br />Since most people stopped watching about the 2nd or 3rd episode, I have to say that the pilot and the wedding / joybug episode were the absolute worst of the lot. There is no hiding Gina Holden's bad acting in those episodes, and it seems like they rushed through the shows on the first take like a soap opera.<br /><br />However, as the season progresses, the show gets remarkably better. The first sign is the episode with the Hawkmen/Dactyls called ascension. Even though the cheese factor in this episode is through the roof you can see that the plot line is starting to come together and get very interesting.<br /><br />The comic-action mood of the series has also finally blossomed. The Baylin character is actually quite funny and Flash has found his place as a hero who is comfortable with his ignorance and makes up for it with a second helping of courage, kind of like the O'Neill character in Stargate SG1. In fact the whole show is starting to feel a lot like Stargate SG1, with the four person save the world team, excellent writing, great mythology, straight-and-narrow good heroes, and of course impossibly hopeless situations that the heroes always get out of unscathed at the last minute.<br /><br />The pinnacle of the season so far has been the "sorrow" episode, which basically tells the story of how Mongo got to be the crappy place it now is. The writing and music are fantastic, and Anna Van Hooft gives an almost tear-jerking performance as she deals with the complicated reality of her life. In fact, the show has started to focus a lot more on her now, and she steals almost every scene she is in. The dale character is also benefiting from Gina Holden's improving acting skills, and it is fun watching her want so badly to be an action hero and contribute to the team. I think it would be totally awesome if she somehow became an honorary Omodrian or took fighting lessons from Baylin. <br /><br />I also have to say I'm pleased with John Ralston's courageous interpretation of the Ming character. He is not afraid to try really risky over-the-top stuff and the cringe factor is off the charts (resulting in what I think is way too much unfair criticism.) I for one admire the enthusiasm the puts into this almost comically unstable character.<br /><br />If you haven't watched Flash Gordon lately, I encourage you to take a second look, the show has undergone a vast improvement!
