Yes, this is really a line from this extreme "no budget" movie. And actually one of the better ones. I do like independent films and I don't mind low budget films IF they have something to offer. This one, well, it may have something to offer to someone, but I can't imagine who.<br /><br />I think this film is less than 60 minutes. I found myself pushing the button on the remote a few times to see how long was left. I was determined that I would watch all of this. That is, until I saw there was still 21 minutes left, and decided that no, I could not possibly subject myself to the rest of this.<br /><br />The story is that of Mulva, an extremely challenged young woman, who is a chocolate addict (I guess, otherwise why would she brush with Hershey's Syrup?). She is delighted because it's Halloween and she's going trick or treating with her overweight friend. And then zombies come to town.<br /><br />Supposedly this story takes place in Tromaville. I'm surprised that Troma allowed the makers of this "film" to use that as it gives Tromaville a very bad image.<br /><br />This whole thing looks like it's made with a video camera and a bunch of people that may have had fun making this but who display absolutely no talent whatsoever. This is billed as a horror comedy, and it's not funny or scary. Mulva speaks with such a speech impediment that it's usually hard to understand anything she says, and she made my eyes hurt.<br /><br />I picked this up in a bargain bin at a local specialty rental store. Maybe I should be more careful at what they offer in the future. I suppose I can trade this in next time I go to Half Price Books, but should I really subject anyone else to this? I should probably snap it in half and toss it in the garbage where it belongs.<br /><br />1 out of 10 and don't even consider seeing this one.
