I give it a 9 out of 10 because nothing is perfect. My partner who never watches these movies decided to sit down for this one afterwards said that was a great fantasy alien thriller. Woohoo there is hope for him yet. Jim Caveziel is so perfectly cast or was that acting omg yes he did do a super acting job in this as does Sophia Myles, John Hurt, and the always a pleasure to watch be the brute Ron Perlman whose part was to short. This is one of those rare finds a well written and directed film, small on budget big on thrills. Original script, very very good top notch FX, the alien creature is ghastly and convincing. You just have to see it, I don't like spoilers, pop some corn, put it in and crank up the sound.
