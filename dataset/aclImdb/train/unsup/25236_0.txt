Fun to watch an early "talking" but the acting is marginal and the fight scene laughable. Fun seeing Montgomery and Crawford in the earliest part of their careers. But you can tell western electric was still playing around with sound trying to get the levels right. Sometimes background music overpowered dialogue.
