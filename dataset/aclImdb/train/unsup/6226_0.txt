This delightful female cast, brings back to the screen an excellent, entertaining, funny, and dramatic wicked elegance of The Full Monty phenomenon with a feminine twist. Julie Waters in a Supporting Actress Oscar performance together with Helen Mirren easily capture the British wry humor and the typical stuck-up attitude of old English propriety its predecessor. There are great moments of laughter and sobering moments of reality and realization of sacrifice, loss, betrayal. One of the best movies of the year. Nine out of ten stars.
