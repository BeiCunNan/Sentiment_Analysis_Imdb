This was not the best movie; but it did not have the run of the mill concept in the storyline or the acting. Good job by Ving Rhames, Jim Brown and Terence Howard. I love the message this movie embodies; it sends out an inspiring message to the disillusioned and the ignorant. It's a positive message that can change lives if people learn from the message and apply the wisdom attained. Honestly, I love what Jim said to Ving about the ignorant killing each other, and about being smart instead of tough in the streets. Kudos to the people who worked on this project; there needs to be more movies made with the same or similar practices and ideas. There was a movie named " Saving God One Soul At A Time " Ving Rhames stars in this movie also which I've found to have a similar message. If anyone enjoys this movie you will definitely like " Saving One Soul At A Time " as well.
