this is by far the best Hindi movie i've ever seen. OK maybe a BIt exaggerated but HECK!!! this movie made my DAY!! HECK it made My LIFE....so well thats that...<br /><br />what wasn't in it to make it excellent? acting,dialogs,story,direction,song everything well managed. Never before have i seen SUCH Perfect placement of SONGS and background scores....Shankhar-Eshan-Loy have just created some of the best tunes ever.....every time the background theme started playing my heart started to melt....<br /><br />This is a movie Bollywood had been long waiting for.... a perfect ROmantic movie with Comedy and Family values... Great ENough to entertain the entire family... Not just the American-Indians but also the Gujratis, Panjabis, Christian-Indians and all the Indian population and the Indian movie lovers.....<br /><br />Kal ho na ho is a MASSIVE entertainer... i know its 3 hours long but still every minute of it is PUT to correct use.... this movie proves in every way that it is better for Hindi movies to stay Hindi with u know reasonable drama comedy songs dance and all that.I am not saying that Hindi movies should not make movies like Maqbool and other serious movies... I am just saying that Movies like KAl ho na ho, Dilwale Dulhaniya are the PRIDE of Indian cinema...So the industry should not forget that...<br /><br />and the even more BETTER thing about this movie is that You can watch this movie like GAZZILION times... every time i see it i love it... its funny and superbly written... Karan Johar is more of a BETTER Writer...... his dialogs are so FUNNY....... like the reference to Preety as MAA-mother.... and the emotional scenes..........how well written.......no matter how FIlmy...there were tears in my eyes so thats the BIG thing.......<br /><br />the leading lady PREETY ZINTA proves herself as a BETTER actress... this is a ROLE she was born for...She is JUST way toooooo BRILLIANT... no one could have been better......and i mean NO-One...Thanks GOD kareena Refused this film... Shah Rukh Khan is PRobably the SUPERSTAR of Indian Cinema...i bet there will be a Shah Rukh Khan day in India in the future.... and as for his Perfromace....... i guess he is being himself.... u know..people say he is being over the TOP...well he is..because his Character indeed is Over the Top so why not.... Shah RUkh is a KEY to this movie.... HE is absolutely Fantastic...i wont stand a word against him... now comes SAIF....... God for some years we did think his days in Bollywood was over.. NOW see how brilliant actor he has become......... he is just Magnificent...such a superb comedic timing...he is really talented this man... JAYA Bachan..... SHe is PERFECT..... she puts life and SOul to this character... she plays the IDIOL mother to such Perefection that i bet every viewer were going like "why don't i have such a understanding mother" in their heads..... and the rest of the cast is totally fabulous.... they are so good that i for times believe that this movie could have been totally different if one of them weren't their... like JIYA for instance....she made me cry... Dadi she made me angry... Sweetu and her SIS mad me laugh.........<br /><br />all in all this is a Perfect Romantic Comedy for the WHOLE FAMILY(really hard to find in this generation)..........I wouldn't change a thing about this movie.... 10/10 I hope you feel the same....
