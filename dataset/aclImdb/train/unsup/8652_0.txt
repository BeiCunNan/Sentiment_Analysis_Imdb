Karen Silkwood(Meryl Streep), is a nuclear factory worker who discovers the unhealthy factors in that plant. She would never back down on anything, and she appears to be straight-forward with the problem. At least she's got a good sense of humor on her. Especially when she flashed the boss. The true story of the life and death of Karen Silkwood really got me intrigued. Living with two co-workers: Drew Stephens(Kurt Russell) and Dolly Pelliker(Cher). These people are very tight, until Karen was given a raise to work at a higher branch. They jealously of other workers probably made them try to make Karen really sick. Going to the reporter from the New York Times was indeed the boldest thing she has ever done. That night she was going to meet with that reporter immortalized her, forever. I don't think the medication made her run off the road. I say someone from the factory did that. She was murdered! After her death, that plant was history! I would like to know more about Karen Silkwood, other than just the movie, she is definitely a hero! 5 stars!
