This movie is one of the typical liberal attempts to rewrite history. It has slaves,Indians,Mexicans and mixed races. Events run from the battle of the Alamo thru Indian wars to the Civil War and then gets to womens suffrage. It's main characters are a rich plantation owner that is part Indian and his daughter who own slaves and her anti-slavery friend that has a slave? and hates Indians. It tries to combine much to much political correctness in way too little time. Of course men are at fault and bashed every 15 minutes. Although most men depicted are wimpy and unrealistic for the time period. I have my disdain for men but I hate to see history warped as this movie depicts. (A regular housewife points out military strategy to General Sam Houston?) Please! Not to mention 50 raiding Indians 15 feet outside a house afraid of 3 women with guns they aren't firing? Half Indian rich plantation owners? I doubt it. Slaves married to Indians? Sheesh. And how did the Indian chief get 50 years older and the girl only gained 10 or 15 years in the same time span? I had to watch this film in 3 sittings as it was laughable to the point of disgust.
