OK let's get something out of the way: this movie is not about introspection of the human soul or whatnot. It's a movie you go see for three basic human needs: sexy sex opposites, cars and stuff blowing up.<br /><br />The movie doesn't aim at any more than this either. There is a small backstory/revenge episode with the main character but what is really interesting are the set pieces, the action, the unprecedented frenetic car combat that takes place.<br /><br />Let's be honest here, if you've been a fan of Mad Max, Death Race 2000 and its ilk, there hasn't been much to your taste in the past, oh, 20 years. Death Race remakes the original without any sense of self-righteousness. It gives the audience big explosions, crazy chases, a lot of bullets, sexy damsels and a satisfying end to one wild romp of a movie.<br /><br />It won't redefine your perception of a good movie, but it may stay with you as one of the most entertaining movie of its genre, if you can call it that. Car Combat movies don't get much better than this and quite frankly, I don't see why they should. They're all about the action after all.<br /><br />So unless you terribly mind turning your brains off to enjoy the show once in a while, chances are you'll have a blast watching Death Race. So for what it's worth, I recommend it.
