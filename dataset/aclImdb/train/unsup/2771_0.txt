I think that the new episodes really betray totally the ideas of Agatha Christie and most of all became less logical. The new authors seem only interested in putting homosexuality themes, morbidity, and similar. These don't own at all to Christie. I'm not a puritan, I don't care if I see a movie with these theme in, but why put them here? They have changed lots of lines, and worst of all changed significantly the plots. In this way then the plots don't work anymore, it lacks logic, it's hard to get the motivations of the characters.<br /><br />In this episode Hunter puts a bomb, Scotland Yard confirms it to Poirot, but... nobody knows it??? Scotland Yard tells it only to Poirot, on request?? Don't you think it's rather absurd? And why did he put the bomb? Because his sister didn't want to share the money with him? It wouldn't be a little more logical to kill the husband and in case next his sister to inherit from her? And why put a scar on his face? The bomb's exploding anyway, just content yourself of the wounds that you get from the explosion... Sorry, I haven't read the book, but I think anyway that the story doesn't work, it's not only a matter of nostalgia or defense of clean Christie's style. It's only, simply, totally WRONG, it's not cinematic!
