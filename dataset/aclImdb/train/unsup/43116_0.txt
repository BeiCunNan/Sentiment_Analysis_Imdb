You know, I thought I had seen it all--San Franciscans protesting going into Afghanistan after witnessing the devastation of the 9/11 attacks, the daily drum-beat of every metropolitan newspaper blaming the US for all the world's atrocities (led by the fanatical liberals at the NYT), the Cindy Sheehans of the world blaming our president for war crimes, and on, and on, and on-- but I will never understand the likes of people that claim they "love this country," "support the troops," and believe in national security, meanwhile stabbing our leaders in the back every chance they get with the daily gratuitous, ad hominem attacks and movies like Death of a President. And all in the name of "art", "satire", dissension, or whatever lame excuse liberals use to justify their perverted ideology. We are at war people! Even if it's not a declared war, our people are out there dying in a hellhole that is Iraq. Regardless of how we got there, anti-patriotic propaganda like this uncalled for. Dissent, yes; undermining our country during these times is really ridiculous!
