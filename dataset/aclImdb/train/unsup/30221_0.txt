This is about Spain in the 70s, with the falangists still in power. A salesman of dictionaries about the civil war is about to be fired. But his boss gives him another opportunity: Start making porno films together with your wife for my company.<br /><br />They start doing so, but there are conflicts of course. This movie can't decide if it is a comedy or a wannabe tragedy and it ends in neither. This could have been mostly funny if the creators had done more of the 70s feeling, but they don't. And in the end you laugh more at the persons you ought to feel sorry about. <br /><br />Not a must.
