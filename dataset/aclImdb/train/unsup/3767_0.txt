A man's wife mysteriously disappears at a gas station in France, and the man obsessively searches for her for years, led on by the psychopath who took her in a cat and mouse game. <br /><br />Nicely photographed in color but with actors going a bit overboard while obviously trying to be "realistic". Some very good scenes, but the ending fails to pay off on all the suspense that has been gradually built up, and is more sad instead of terrible.
