I thought this movie was great! It was very cute but kind of cheesy, I think thats what made it good. It had a great love story in the middle of a mildly sensible crime story.<br /><br />The story of a rich prude, bored with her life, who finally finds something interesting to fulfill her time: skating. But when a man comes to replace their beloved skating rink with a mini mall, she will stop at nothing to stop him. Her skating friends and boyfriend are the only ones who will stick with her. All the while, she has time to practice for a roller boogie contest with her boyfriend and blow away her fellow contestants. Classic!!!
