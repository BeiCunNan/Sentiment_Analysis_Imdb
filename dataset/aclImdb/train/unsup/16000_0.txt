While in the taxi, He loses the only 20 dollar bill he has in wallet, which seems to set off bad Karma for our hero. He is thrusted suddenly in a Soho nightmare of bizarre characters and incidents that have him a wanted list crimes he didn't commit. After Hours is a Dark and strangely funny movie that a lot about the karma we create for ourselves in our own lives and the exit out!!! Very funny movie
