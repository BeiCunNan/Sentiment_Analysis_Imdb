Aficionados of film noir find very few movies in the cycle without some interest -- even the poverty-row programmers that come in just under or over an hour tend to have something to sustain interest. Shoot To Kill, alas, is not among them. Though the script contains some twists, the director handles the narrative structure so clumsily that they come not as surprises but as irritations. And the totally unknown cast (and crew) goes through their paces without a spark of originality or inspiration. It's hard to leave a movie without a positive note to be sounded, but Shoot To Kill serves as a reminder of just how depressing bottom-of-the-barrel filmmaking in the postwar years could be.
