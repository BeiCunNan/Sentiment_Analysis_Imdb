"Midnight Blue" is a rare case of a soft core flick that is interesting not only because of the sex scenes, but for the plot.<br /><br />Here the cinematography, acting, and even clothing looks very early 90's and that could be labeled as a negative point but when the story starts to develop and some of the sex sequences get steamier, you can truly find yourself enjoying it good time.<br /><br />It had been said that the Director uses some Hitchcock references and it's true but it's hard to use a solid plot on a film like this. Still, the result is more than satisfying.<br /><br />There are hot women, good sex, and interesting plot. This is a classic by all means.
