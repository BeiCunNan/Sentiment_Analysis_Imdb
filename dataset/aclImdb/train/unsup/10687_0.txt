Hoping for another Academy nod, Jean-Xavier de Lestrade unsuccessfully tries to duplicate the gritty, grainy realism that won Maha productions its first Oscar.<br /><br />De Lestrade's earlier cinematic critique of the US justice system, "Un Coupable Ideal," won the 2002 Academy Award for best documentary feature.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Maha's second movie about a murder on a Sunday morning fails to capture any of the reality of the North Carolina murder case, and ends up being nothing short of fantasy. <br /><br />The filmmaker has bent over backward to create the impression that the accused killer, Michael Peterson, is the innocent victim of a wide-spread conspiracy.<br /><br />Jean-Xavier de Lestrade's strangely biased movie masquerading as a real-life documentary represents a tragic fall from the honesty of his other work.
