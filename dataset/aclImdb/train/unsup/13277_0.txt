Unbelievably bad. It's like, you should pardon the expression, a photo layout in Playgirl which no female ever seems to buy or see wink wink wink. The thin non plot just seems to consist of contrived opportunities to look at Michael Baldoz with his shirt off. What they saved on wardrobe for Mr. Baldoz they more than made up for with the body waxing (baldchest?) The boys are miners in this brilliantly lighted mine with twenty foot ceilings and gravel just waiting to be scooped up. They don't even break a sweat what with constant daubs from the body make-up sponge. Soft core porn for the guys who buy Playgirl. How do these movies get made?
