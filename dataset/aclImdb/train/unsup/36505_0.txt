I *have* to see plausibility in a film. even sci-fi stuff with half-man half-beast stuff has some plausibility what with DNA tampering possible.<br /><br />but this clich√© laden namby pamby cutesy thing is the first time I give a NEGATIVE number on the plausibility meter.<br /><br />rich white guys from the south don't marry their servant's black daughters no matter how good looking they sound and look. and they don't get shipped off to Vietnam and get shot rescuing an orphan. if they're in Vietnam, THEY'RE the one barking the orders having graduated from ROTC.<br /><br />and rich southern gentry don't will their vast art collection to former black employees either.<br /><br />I just couldn't get past all this ridiculousness to see any poignancy in the film. way too much hooey to see any 'message'.
