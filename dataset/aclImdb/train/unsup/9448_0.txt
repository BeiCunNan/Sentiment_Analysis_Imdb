I thought this movie was fun to watch while at the same time provided plenty of healthy messages for kids/teens without overloading them or taking away from the movie. If you are looking for the best acting you have ever seen and a serious drama, this may not be your movie. But, if you are looking for an entertaining film, based on a true story with plenty of sound messages and great role models for your children; then this is the movie for you. The characters are believable as well as likable and you find yourself rooting for them throughout the movie. Double Teamed shows that with hard work, a sound family support system and belief in yourself and others it is possible to accomplish your dreams whatever they may be.
