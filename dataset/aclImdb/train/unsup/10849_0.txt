I stumbled across this one as a surprise on my local PBS station; and fell in love with it immediately.<br /><br />Jake's embittered by his situation and not the most likable person as a result. He falls in with a bunch of folks who, in his view, might well be escapees from the Twilight Zone. Conversely, his new co-workers regard his as a stereotype come to life...and an escapee from the Twilight Zone.<br /><br />Watching the Yank and the Canucks learn first to tolerate than take a positive delight in one another is a riot. Judy, the news producer who is Jake's boss and foil, is a delight: Mary Richards as woman of (mostly) steel. Bill, the station manager is a continual laugh as a man who really believes he knows all about Americans but who really needs to get a clue or three.<br /><br />This show is always fun for what is says about Canada and Canadians as much as what it says about us. Ultimately, no one escapes unscathed.
