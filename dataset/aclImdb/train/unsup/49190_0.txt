After watching this movie about a "day in the life of a restaurant," I couldn't understand the high rating it gets on IMDb, but then I noticed that most of the reviewers are former wait-persons who identified with the over-the-top caricatures of the staff and customers of these restaurants.<br /><br />For anyone else it is just a bunch of crude high-school level gross-out jokes. <br /><br />I realize comedy is subjective, but I kept hoping that the energetic (and in some cases attractive) cast might actually be given some sort of comedic situational set-up for the jokes instead of a series of barely (pun intended) connected stoopid gags.
