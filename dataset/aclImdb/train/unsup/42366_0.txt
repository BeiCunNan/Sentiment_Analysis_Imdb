Jules Verne must be spinning in his grave to see his excellent novel turned into a shoddy little romance for those who move their lips when they read. If they can read at all.<br /><br />Ben Cross is a decent actor, as was Richard Crenna, but they were badly miscast in this low-grade, moronic little adventure flick and their hearts truly didn't seem to be in it at all. Small wonder.<br /><br />Unless there is absolutely nothing else on TV except Love Boat re-runs, don't do this one unless you're about half drunk and looking for laughs. Seeing Ben Cross in his silly little uniform with the faggy pink sash -- ye Gods, how could he keep a straight face?<br /><br />I'd give it about half a star. Maybe.
