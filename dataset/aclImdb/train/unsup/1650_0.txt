This silent movie concerns the road to the throne in late fourteen century England of scheming and ruthless Richard Duke of Gloucester. I am really interested in the character created by Shakespeare and the historical Richard both. But trying to make a movie based upon a play in 1912 when cinema was silent is quite difficult; so if you haven't read the play, is possible that sometimes you find yourself puzzled about what is going on, although restored titles summarize the plot well. Mr Warde gives a creepy feeling to the character, showing at the same time a brutal and fearful man, as possibly the real Richard III was. I recommend this movie to all Shakespeare lovers, a long time go I watched the movie made by Lawrence Olivier, like too Keep in mind that this movie was done when cinema tricks, like editing or crosscutting, was yet not in use; so the way of filming is quite simple: they put the camera and shoot all the scenes in a medium shot, there is only a brief shot closer to Richard, reminds me all the movie the Frankenstein made by Edison in 1910. So, if you love Shakespeare, old movies (well transferred to DVD) and tasting the feeling of watching a near 100 years old flick, see it. I give it 7 stars out of 10.
