I wish i could say this was a great Hugh Grant Movie, but I would be lying. Sure he plays a great part here, and it is interesting that Kirsten Scott Thomas is along as his wife Fiona. Now I understand why she was in love with him in Four Weddings and a Funeral in which she also played Fiona :-), but Polanski created a film for Peter Coyote and Emmanuelle Seigner (The Ninth Gate).<br /><br />Cyote is just about the most sleazy person you can imagine as he goes about using and abusing Seigner until she is reduced to nothing, She is willing to do anything to remain with him. Why? That is a good question and what I see as the whole point here. Why remain in a relationship where there was never any love in the first place and there is clearly no love now? Wht degrade yourself to "do anything" to stay together? The degradation continues when they meet Grant and Thomas on a cruise and Grant is panting to get a chance with Seigner. Who wouldn't. But there is a very funny twist at the end before tragedy strikes.<br /><br />Makes you really look at relationships in a new light.
