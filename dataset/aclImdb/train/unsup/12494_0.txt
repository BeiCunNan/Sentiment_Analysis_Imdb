I was looking through a couple of huge tables of VCDs at a store in Chinatown when I came across this film for about 2 bucks. The plot was about a hit-man in New York City hitting the wrong target and then deciding to protect the right target as a means of penance. I figured it would be great to see city through the eyes of a foreign film crew-I assumed it was a straight Hong Kong film. What the film is is a rather tepid film made in English with Richard Grieco as the hit-man and Maggie Q as the target. Frankly I don't care that Maggie Q is topless. Nor does it really matter that this was the first film shot with the HD cameras that would be used in films like Sin City. What I care about is a good story and this film doesn't really have one. Its nothing we haven't seen before and its told rather blandly. Even a TV movie would make the proceedings this dull and confusing. The Two leads are fine, or as fine as they can be with what little they are given to do. Grieco is basically required to be brooding, and he does it well. All kidding aside he's a good actor but after a few crappy parts like this its understandable that his name often elicits a "who?' when its mentioned. The film apparently isn't available here in the US and having seen the movie I can understand why, its a turkey.
