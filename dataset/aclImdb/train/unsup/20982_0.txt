I had never heard of the film To End all Wars when I picked it up at my local library because it looked like a good popcorn kinda war movie and had one of my favorite actors in Robert Carlyle. I must say how wrong I was, do not see this movie as a popcorn film, it is as far from that as something like Schindlers List. It is a very disturbing and powerful film about men mostly Scottish who are taken prisoner by the Japs in World War 2, and are tortured and forced to build a railroad to India on very little food. The movie is filled with great little things as well as all the great big things, my favorite is that one of the characters in called. He is called Yanker, as they say its because he's American and he's kinda a w_anker. The film is filled with wonderful little touches like this making what would have just been a very good film into a truly great picture and one of the best war films ever made.
