I have yet to learn why this superb drama has never been taken out of the archives and released on DVD. It has been suggested that it has been kept under wraps because of the risk of facing the ire of the Christian Right. If correct this is not only ridiculous but indicates that the BBC is pandering to pressure from minority groups.<br /><br />All I can hope is that with the 150th anniversary of the publication of On The Origin of Species coming up next year the BBC will finally do the honorable thing and make this available.<br /><br />Perhaps we should all petition Sir David Attenborough and Professor Dawkins to add their voices to our request?<br /><br />Failing that I suppose we could save our pennies and buy the DVDs from BBC Education I believe they are available for a mere Â£850.00!
