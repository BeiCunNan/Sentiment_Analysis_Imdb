Me and a friend were sitting in the local movie store and decided to just go to the horror section, spin around in a circle, and point at the first movie we saw and then rent said movie. Luckily, or unluckily, we ended up renting "Evil's City". Now, it was completely our intention to rent a terrible movie, so you could say that we were more than satisfied with our choice.<br /><br />There's really only one phrase that can accurately describe what a pile of crap this is: a HUGE pile of crap. The DVD alone reeks of bland, uninspired filth. No special features or "making-of" that would most likely just show the writer pooping out his script. The scene selection offers 4, yes FOUR scenes to choose from. I guess the editor couldn't figure out how to slice this steamer of a movie into eighths or sixteenths. Anyway, DVD features aside, the film itself sucks. The only remotely significant character, who I assume is some kind of angel that wears black, is an Aussie who has about 8 minutes of screen time and then disappears for the rest of the film. You later see his face poorly pasted on a stained-glass window which causes a female character to scream rather inappropriately.<br /><br />The only way you can like this movie is if you love clip-art special effects, shoe string budgets (and when I say shoe string I mean the director literally sold his shoe strings to fund the movie when he should've just wrapped them around his neck and hung himself), and putting emphasis on the wrong syllables. This movie needs to be filed under comedy for the unintentional hilarity that ensues on this whacky adventure all the way from the random beginning, over the mountain of plot less and disconnected exposition and then ultimately to the regret of even wasting your time on this.<br /><br />I give Evil's City a -20 out of 10.
