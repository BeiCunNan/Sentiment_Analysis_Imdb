OK, most of the idiocy here is obvious, but here's what I want to know:<br /><br />How could anyone be so dumb as to think a robot cop who is programmed to act as judge, jury, and executioner would catapult its sponsor to the White House, even if it worked perfectly?<br /><br />Now, I can see how a talented demagogue might be able to whip up a temporary popular enthusiasm for such a thing. However, party apparatuses have a great deal to say about who gets nominated to run for President.<br /><br />The intellectuals, activists, and theoreticians of *both* major parties would be horrified at the prospect of such a vigilante robot army; the Democrats on left-libertarian rights-theory grounds, the Republicans based on conservative suspicion of the Leviathan state and the concentration of power. There is simply no way that the ROTOR project would boost its sponsor's political career. If anything, rather the opposite.<br /><br />So how is this guy going to become President?<br /><br />Yeah, I know, I know; if *that's* what bothers me about ROTOR...
