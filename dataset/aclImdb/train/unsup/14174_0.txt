Barbara (Patricia Tallman) and her brother Johnnie are visiting their mother's grave in a cemetery in the country, 320 km far from their homes. There, Barbara realizes that dead persons are walking again. Barbara escapes from a walking copse, gets in a farmhouse in panic. Then she meets Ben (Tony Todd) in this house. They realize that there are other survivals inside the cellar. All of them get trapped in this house surrounded by dead bodies that eat flesh. The 1968 `The Night of the Living Dead' is, in my opinion, the best horror movie ever made. I have watched the original film more than ten times, and I intend to see it again and again. This remake was a wonderful surprise for me: It is also a great movie, with some minors modification in the story. The actors and the direction are sharp and many actors and actresses look like the original ones. I have watch this remake at least five time. Yesterday I bought the Brazilian DVD. This DVD is great: you have both versions (widescreen and fullscreen) and lots of extras. I regret only that the extras do not have subtitles, so Brazilians that can not speak English will lose this bonus. My vote is eight.
