Why did I even watch this movie? How good could a sequel to a Brooke Shields movie be? The original was no classic but it was bad enough to be enjoyable, had beautiful photography and plenty of sex and nudity.<br /><br />This sequel isn't bad/good...just BAD!!! It has no nudity or sex (hence the PG-13 rating) but it does have nice photography. The plot is so ridiculous I won't even get into it--you can read the plot synopsis on the title page of this "movie".<br /><br />Brian Krause and Milla Jojovich are good-looking and have nice firm bodies but are even worse actors than Shields and Christopher Atkins in the original! I know that's hard to believe, but it's true.<br /><br />The low points of the film: the movie trying to teach the kids about sex; the kids discovering a native tribe on their island after SEVENTEEN years (!!!); the attempts at acting; the script.<br /><br />The high points: there aren't any.<br /><br />Avoid at ALL costs!!!
