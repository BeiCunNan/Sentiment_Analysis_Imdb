But that's because it was so boring, I could only take it in 20 minute snippets. Then I would take a thirty or so minute break and play Freecell on my computer. The reason I continued watching it is because as bad as the movie was, Sean Penn was excellent. His introducing himself as William S. Burroughs was hilarious and his comic timing is flawless. One odd thing that came out was how much the Janes smoked. It was almost like the very first season of Dragnet, I mean the one in 1954, where cigarettes seemed to grow out of peoples faces. Regarding Elizabeth Hurley, let me just first say that when I first heard that Tomb Raider was going to be made into a movie, Hurley was the ONLY actress I saw playing the role, since, a) she looks exactly LIKE Lara Croft AND b) she's ALREADY English! Angelina Jolie, however, had won an academy award so that's where the money was. That being said, Hurley's character was so obvious and Lucas's character so unaware that their relationship seemed completely imaginary, unlike the Janes. There was an enormous amount of confusion regarding her character and at one point it was suggested that she played a major role in Sean Penn's character's (Thomas Janes) past, although this may have been a projection of Jean Janes' suspicious fantasy. What is also telling is that in the DVD, there WERE no deleted or extended scenes, nor were there directors comments. I got this movie because I saw the trailer. WHAT A SWINDLE! The person who has a future is the guy who put together the trailer. From crappy to snappy.
