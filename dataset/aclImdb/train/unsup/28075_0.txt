Steel mill owner Lionel Atwill (as John "Flint" Dawson) is derailed by evil associate Jamieson Thomas (as James "Jim" Marley). After Mr. Thomas costs Mr. Atwell the loss of his legs, he seizes control of the business. Before Atwell is even out of the hospital, Thomas convinces Atwell's wife to take their daughter, and move to England. Now a pauper, Atwell moves from his private hospital room to recover with blind beggar Henry B. Walthall (as Marchant).<br /><br />Mr. Walthall helps Atwell, who assumes the name "John Daniels", back on his feet (a figure of speech). With Walthall's help, Atwell organizes a "Union" for beggars. Their beggar "Union" makes Atwell wealthier than ever. After fifteen years, he decides to return to the old steel mill, and seek revenge against Thomas. But, Atwell doesn't know his pretty long lost daughter, Betty Furness (as Joyce Dawson), has returned to America, and is being romanced by his old enemy's son, James Bush (as Lee Marley)Â… <br /><br />The cast is a treat, but the production and story become increasingly mediocre.<br /><br />**** Beggars in Ermine (1934) Phil Rosen ~ Lionel Atwell, Jamieson Thomas, Henry B.
