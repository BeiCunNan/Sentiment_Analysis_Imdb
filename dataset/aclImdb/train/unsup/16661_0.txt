Allan Felix (Woody Allen) is a quirky film critic who has very minimal success with the ladies after being dumped by his wife. With the help of his two friends (Diane Keaton and Tony Roberts) and an imaginary Humphrey Bogart, he attempts to find a mate, but falls for the wrong one.<br /><br />Like I said in the summary, I really don't find Woody Allen to be that great of an actor. Play it Again, Sam changed my mind! This is a lighthearted comedy that I found to be his greatest film. Woody Allen plays the same character he always plays in his movies, but I actually found him to be quite funny in this one. The whole idea of Humphrey Bogart teaching him how to get women was just hysterical to me also. Jerry Lacy was a wonderful Bogart and the on-screen chemistry between Keaton and Allen was as wonderful as in Annie Hall. Overall, Play it Again, Sam was a wonderful quirky comedy but defiantly contains Woody Allen humor.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.
