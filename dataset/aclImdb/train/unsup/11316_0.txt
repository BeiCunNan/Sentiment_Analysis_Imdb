After watching this teacher teaching high school history, you know why some of our teaching is bad as well as this film.<br /><br />This teacher is as dull as they come. Dressing up like Lincoln at his March, 1861 Inaugural was really the absolute nonsense here.<br /><br />To make matters worse, our miserable teacher is the narrator in this ridiculous movie with a genre of black comedy. It is just ultimately ridiculous.<br /><br />This teacher is leading a dull life as well and all that changes with the kidnapping of one of his students. You would think that this would become an interesting who did it, but the whole film falls apart. The kidnapped girl's father acts erratically. What father of a kidnapped teenager would go on television and reduce the prices of his car as a motivation to get his daughter back?<br /><br />Dad should have been investigated immediately. There is something radically wrong with the writing here. This is a complete joke.
