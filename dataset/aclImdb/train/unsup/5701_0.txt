Some commenters on the left side of the aisle call this film "propaganda;" but being propagandistic doesn't make it false. In fact, the Hoaxters' historical sketch of the rise and various phases of Communism, and its continuing danger to liberty and freedom (as we just saw in Georgia under brutal Soviet -- sorry, Russian occupation), is remarkably accurate, given the constraints of a movie short.<br /><br />Definitely worth the viewing time for anybody not utterly besotted with the anti-anti-communist propaganda routinely taught in school these days, where kids are told that Joe McCarthy was a greater threat to world peace and liberty than Josef Stalin.
