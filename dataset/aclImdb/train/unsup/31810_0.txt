I've seen three movies by Randal Kleiser and each time I have been impressed. As far as musicals go, Grease is in my top 5. Although I recently saw Bye Bye Birdie (made in the early 60s) and now can see where Grease got a lot of it's "style" from. Not a criticism at all, just an observation.<br /><br />All in all, the direction, the choreography, the music and, of course, the cast all came together for a tight match.<br /><br />John Travolta and Olivia Newton John headed up the very talented cast. They had a great chemistry together. I wondered why they didn't do many other movies together. The production design and the camera work were great too, mixing in a lot pleasant to look at colors. It was a visual candy bar.
