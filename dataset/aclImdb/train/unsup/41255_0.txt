i have actually just recently seen an episode of _The Simple Life_, not of my own volition either. i just have to say that i would have to not only rate this pathetic excuse for a show as a "1," but i would have to say that Paris Hilton's IQ is probably lower than that, even down into the negative digits if that's possible. how could anyone sit and watch this drivel? i just don't understand what television has come to. this show points out the most shallow and selfish aspects of human beings, and people find this entertaining? oh, yes, probably people with the same IQ as Paris herself. forgive me, folks, but this just happens to be my own opinion. if you've not seen this show, for goodness sake, find something else to do with your time.
