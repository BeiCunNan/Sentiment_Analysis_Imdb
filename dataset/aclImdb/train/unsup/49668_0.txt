Pretty bad movie. Lots of hype, no substance. Have to say this is one of the worse yet this year. My 8 and 3 year old never got interested in it at all and they love most all movies. Sad. Feel ripped off and wish I could get money back. Oh well, live and learn. The plot is all over the place. Tries to make some sort of connection between man and girl and it fails. I still don't know what the plot was about actually. Was it about the store being magic? The girl being the reason for magic? The mutant being the helper. I just don't get it. They called an accountant a mutant all through the movie and he seemed to not care being called a name of hate. I just have nothing good to say about this. And I usually can say something good about all movies.
