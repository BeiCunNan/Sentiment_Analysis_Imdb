I first saw Brandy & Mr. Whiskers on the Disney channel and decided to watch it. While I do like Charles Adler's voice acting, this show don't really make me laugh. I really didn't find it funny. I found Dave the Barbarian to be funnier.<br /><br />SPOILERS!!! For those who don't know anything about this show, it's about two animals who get stranded in the Amazon Jungle. A snotty and pampered pooch named Brandy and a brain dead rabbit named Mr. Whiskers who wears an orange jail outfit or so that's what it looks like.<br /><br />The first episode showed them falling into the jungle, meeting Loa-Boa, a snake who is purple and pink and wears earrings. She saves them in the first episode towards the end.<br /><br />The show is mildly enjoyable, but don't have the charm as some old school shows like Nick's Nicktoons per say Rocko, Angry Beavers and the Ren and Stimpy Show.<br /><br />The only thing I found kind of funny was when they cue to real photos in the show.<br /><br />I rate this show 3 out of 5 claw prints
