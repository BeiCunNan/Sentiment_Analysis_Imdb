Did anyone think this was funny in 1957? The Saucer Men have nice heads and sharp claws, but the cast of this dreadful comedy is strictly L7, Daddy-O. Pitsville, USA. AIP could only make decent comedies when Roger Corman was at the helm, and this film has good ol' Edward L. Cahn calling the shots, so you know it's going to be formulaic AND boring.
