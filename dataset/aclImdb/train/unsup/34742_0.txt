The movie starts out with Marilyn Fryser(Joan Collins) who is suckering a group of people into purchasing phony real estate. What she doesn't know is that a bunch of ants have been eating radioactive waste from a barrel that washed up ashore. The toxic waste turns the ants into giant mutant ants. Now, Marilyn and the tourists must fight for their lives. Once they reach a town, they find a sheriff and contact him and tell him about what was going on. The sheriff and several other police officers lead them to a sugar factory. What they see is a container holding the queen ant and it's farting a mind controlling gas on people. At the end, they blow up the sugar factory, get on a boat, and take off.<br /><br />There were a few problems I've had: <br /><br />One: How did the ants manage to convince the sheriff and his posse to build a container and keep feeding them sugar? Surely, if the sheriff saw them, he would have been shooting at them. Nothing like that ever happened.<br /><br />Two: How did they build the container that holds the queen within a matter of hours? How did they get the queen in there? <br /><br />Three: Why wasn't anybody else just as terrified as the tourists? They just kept in line and had blank faces WILLING to get sprayed by this giant ant that now controls the whole town! <br /><br />I give this movie 1 star out of 10. This is the worst insect monster movie I've ever seen!
