When an ancient Egyptian tomb is found in a North American park, a group of scientists and students of Egyptology arrive to the site to study the inscriptions. Meanwhile, the four thousand years old evil high-priestess Aneh-Tet (Claudia Lyns) awakes and seeks six offerings to revive her legion of mummies. Then she needs the blood of a virgin to bring her father back to life, become immortal and rule the world.<br /><br />I bought this DVD based on the name of Bruce Boxleitner and the wonderful art of the cover of the DVD. However, the story is very disappointing, and I particularly liked two scenes: the nudity of the gorgeous and sexy Claudia Lyns, and the funny line of Sheriff Jones, when he says to his skeptical assistant: "- Just because a chicken has wings doesn't mean it can fly." My vote is two.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Not Available
