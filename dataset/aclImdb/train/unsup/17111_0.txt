Remember 'The Crow'? The brilliantly dark and visceral story about a man seeking vengance from beyond the grave? Remember how picturesque the gothic scenery was, how great the character's were, how badly you wanted to see things set right? Well keep on remembering, because you'll get NONE of that in this, the third installment of sequels that should've stopped before they began. I LOVED the first movie, amazing. The 2nd one stunk, but its still got a few points for cinematography. This third film takes the plot of the first film, bastardizes it, and tries to regurgitate it in this insanely stupid film. A weaker plot there is NOT! Not to mention the character's that all seem to be running around fulfilling the plot elements with almost no sense of motivation. horrible horrible horrible. Not even worth a watch because of Kirsten Dunst.
