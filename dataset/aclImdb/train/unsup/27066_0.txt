Knock Knock is a new low-budget horror film, which is unfortunately a really bad attempt at a slasher flick. I could not believe how bad this movie turned out to be, as the movie sounded and looked somewhat entertaining. This wasn't even so bad it was good...it was just so bad.<br /><br />A group of friends find themselves being killed off by a serial killer who knocks at your door, and then kills you. Well, at least that's what I think...because barely any of the kills fit the title at all. The opening scene actually made me jump a little, and thats probably the only positive thing I have to say about this movie. Opening scene was good, but too short-lived.<br /><br />The acting is mostly so-so to bad. The "lead" (we'll move onto her later) was like a cheap attempt at a lead, and all of the friends she had were just annoying and undeveloped. None of these characters had any character development whatsoever and you didn't feel for them when they died...quickly. I can't remember any of their names, and some would disappear for long lengths of time and then die quickly (after having about 5 minutes screen time total previously). The detectives were atrocious and were probably some of the worst cops you can ask for. The lead female detective dressed like a call-girl to work, and had a temper and a complete attitude on her. I didn't know a cop could slap someone in an interrogation, and get away with it. They did the worst detective work you could ask for, and didn't seem bothered by the fact that, at crime scenes, there would be limbs everywhere. Oh yeah...what was the point of the WWE wrestler Stephanie? Cleavage? As if the movie didn't have enough already.<br /><br />Now, onto the lead girl. This was some of the worst characterization I have ever witnessed in film. The movie clocks in at around 84 minutes. The lead girl is first seen in the first 5 minutes of the film, for around 15 minutes and DISAPPEARS until the last 5 minutes of the film! We don't see or hear anything from her character at all and it's as if her character didn't exist or the actress just walked out on set and they continued filming. Her boyfriend, who is made to look like the male lead, has the same thing happen to him! That was bad writing right there. I couldn't believe this as I kept on waiting for the lead and her boyfriend to show up...didn't happen until the last few minutes of this crap-fest.<br /><br />The kill scenes were just so rushed, you could only watch them with a straight face and just think "lame". None of the characters put up a fight at all, and would be killed very quickly and then they would be brutalized after being killed. I think this was the writer/directors way of making it longer, when they just damn right sucked. The whole plot just went from supernatural to slasher and it couldn't decide what it was. It was messy. The killer looked like a reject from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and looked like a guy dressed up as Leatherface for Halloween. Only, this guys face looked like paper mache.<br /><br />I'm going to end this review saying that this movie has one of the worst extras I have ever seen in a film. EVER. During a flashback scene, one extra keeps looking towards the camera repeatedly and seems completely bored and uninvolved in the whole scene. He looked completely lost, as if he didn't know what he was meant to be doing. But I'm not surprised in a way...because this was a bad movie period!<br /><br />3/10
