This one I like a bit less than part two, but they are almost even in their enjoyment value. However, my favorite of the series now has to be Silent Hill Origins thanks to a vastly improved combat and movement system. This one has a good story of a girl who while at the mall starts to see weird things, then of course monsters show up and our gal named Heather must navigate the demented mall, which gets even more demented after a ride in an elevator. She also has to navigate the subways, sewers, and office buildings...all this before she even gets to Silent Hill! And once you get to Silent Hill you will be amazed at how foggy it is! The story is great as it seems to be a sequel to the first one, and of course Origins fits nicely in there too. I would elaborate on it more, but I don't want to give to much away...except I will say I hated that Claudia woman a lot. Those religious nuts always get my blood boiling. So there you have it, the atmosphere is also killer, I loved how you switched over to the more deformed and evil world and the puzzles were not to difficult to piece together. The problems come in the combat...a weakness for all Silent Hill games, you often get damaged and killed less because of your skill and more for the camera angles. Granted this makes it a bit more scary I guess, but I hate when the camera pans to the front of you when I need to see what is ahead. It is also sometimes to hard as I had a bit of difficulty with the final enemy even on easy. Still all in all this was a great survival horror game.
