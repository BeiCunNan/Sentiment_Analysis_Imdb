I must say, this is a great movie. Mike Myers is the most talented individual that I know of, and he just further proved this in So I Married an Axe Murderer. The movie had me reeling and dancing, wishing I was in his place. Everything about this movie has me wanting to watch it repeatedly, and I just can't seem to get enough of it. Bits of it were a tad stereotypical, but Mike, Thomas, and the rest of the gang proved to put an interesting enough twist on it to make it unique in its own way. This is most definitely the single best movie that is available out there (however in a close second, check out Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Gene Wilder is astounding).
