After hearing mostly negative comments about this film, I was impressed. It offered an interesting view into the elitist collegiate atmosphere of the time, was frank about relationships, and had another fine performance by Ramon Novarro.<br /><br />Novarro looked more convincing as a student than some of the other players, and yet was thirty-three at the time. He certainly looked more age-appropriate than William Haines in West Point, and Haines was five years Novarro's junior when that film was made. I liked that fact that Novarro's character was made more life-like by conflicting traits as well. He was studious, promiscuous, proud, humble, a "dirty" fighter, and yet devoted to "weak" friends as well. Madge Evans' presence was not appreciably felt in this film, although her close-up during the commencement scene was a true eye-opener for me. Never had I seen her look so beautiful! Also, after seeing Martha Sleeper's "vamp," I'd love to view more films of hers.<br /><br />What interested me greatly was the depiction of college life in the film. How these snobbish upper-crust sorts had, at the same time, a code of honor, and would fill noble places in society is an interesting question. There were times when their treatment of Novarro was revolting, but yet they seemed good fellows at the end--how true in life. I doubt that the same sense of honor and tradition is present at these blue-blood universities today. <br /><br />I agree with the other viewer about the sound recording. It was abominable in some scenes, particularly when one had the already daunting task of penetrating thick Italian accents.<br /><br />A viewer should be pleased by this film. However, the fact that its reach exceeded its grasp should be no surprise when one considers that MGM through second-rate films destroyed the careers of its leading silent actors Gilbert, Haines, Keaton, and yes, Ramon Novarro. If they had really cared (say as much as they cared about Robert Montgomery's films), this film would be more focused.
