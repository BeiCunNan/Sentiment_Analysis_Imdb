While the gameplay of Jedi Knight II is far superior to Jedi Knight, I think the game is a bit of a dissapointment in other areas. For one thing, I much prefer the live action cutscenes in JK1 to the ones rendered with the game engine in JK2. The live action cutscenes really brought the story to life in JK1. Since the acting in JK2 is done by Quake 3 models, the cutscenes lack any sign of life. They look especially lifeless and flat where there are supposed to be emotional scenes, such as Jan and Kyle kissing.<br /><br />I have played JK1 many times and I always watch the cutscenes fully. I even go back sometimes just to watch the cutscenes because they are done so well. When I play JK2 again, I'll probably just skip the cutscenes because I think they look very amateurish. It's almost as if the cutscenes are an afterthought to join the levels together, not as a part of the overall story as in Jedi Knight.<br /><br />*Spoilers below*<br /><br />Now we come to the story. While JK2's story is ok, it is no where near as good as JK1. In the beginning of the game we find out that Kyle has given up his force abilities. He and Jan now operate as mercenaries for the New Republic. After several levels fighting imperials, it appears as if Jan is killed by a Dark Jedi called Desann. Kyle then goes to Luke Skywalker to get his lightsaber and force abilities back so he can avenge Jan's death.<br /><br />Now here is the really odd part about this story. It doesn't seem to bother Luke that Kyle wants to regain his force powers so he can get revenge. If I understand Star Wars correctly, revenge along with fear, hate, agression, etc... will lead to the Dark side! Don't you think Luke would try to object to this a bit more? The rest of it is pretty average "kill the bad guy and get the girl" type stuff.<br /><br />*Spoilers end*<br /><br />Overall, Raven have done an excellent job with the gameplay and level design, but the story is pretty average and I REALLY WANT PROPER CUTSCENES!!!<br /><br />I gave it 8/10 though because the game is a lot of fun to play and the multiplayer is excellent. If it wasn't for the excellent gameplay, I would have only given it 5/10.
