This film highlights what was probably going on after 9/11 but less so nowadays since people have had time to get their head back on straight. The Parallel stories show how similar the paranoia about terrorism is around the world even in countries as different as America and China, and that certain about you and bad luck in todays world can land you in that situation. Why was the nudity so apparent couldn't they just have moved past these scenes as they would make the movies rating towards the adult rating.Why was only the Americans girls family shown reacting to her arrest the guy in the story might have had family reacting badly to his arrest, this would have shown how he had a life to lose also. The abuses endured by these characters are atrocious shouldn't the people involved have been looking for real terrorist since it was obvious these people were most likely innocent people caught up in the post 9/11 paranoia. Overall I liked this movie although it did leave me worried about the cheapness of freedom. compared to making people safe. Why the interrogators asked the same questions and were given the same answers to them still eludes me as they could have made the questioning reflect the person who was being question.
