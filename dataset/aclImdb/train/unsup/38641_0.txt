I hated this film so much that I don't even feel like writing an intelligent analysis...how about, horrible acting, shaky camera, shove reality in your face kinda movie? avoid at all costs....I am not a big fan of movies that re-enact real life events...I thought Munich was an absolute piece of garbage movie...this one is right up there...maybe they could have filmed the cast being taken out back and beaten once the film was over for such an abysmal performance.... Now I upset myself...toss this one on the fire, along with House of Sand and Fog...and quite frankly, even if I were a journalist with heroic delusions, I would definitely stay out of a hellhole country like this couple was in....Angelina has done nothing to ever recommend her as a good actress...without her looks she would be nowhere, like this movie...
