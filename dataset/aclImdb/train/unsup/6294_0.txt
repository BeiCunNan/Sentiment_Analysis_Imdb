Now, the trailer for this didn't worry me in the slightest. A little girl who can make her drawings move? Ha! But good God, was I wrong. This episode is an incredibly clever piece of writing that actually quite surprised me.<br /><br />With the benefit of hindsight, there's not a single thing mentioned in this entire episode that doesn't count towards the final outcome. The attention to detail is perfect - the '09' and '61' numberplates on the cars, the news ticker on the bottom of the TV - nothing at all gets missed. Billie Piper is outstanding as she shows just how good a sidekick Rose is, both Chloe and her mother play their parts perfectly, and David Tennant is brilliant as usual.<br /><br />The idea behind the whole story is genius, and the way it pans out even had me, a hardened Resident Evil fan, feeling tense a couple of times. I'd say this is probably one of the best episodes of the series - although, to be honest, still not even a patch on The Girl in the Fireplace, which is easily the best since the show was revived.
