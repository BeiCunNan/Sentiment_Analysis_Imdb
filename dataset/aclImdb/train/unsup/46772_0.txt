As usual I thought I was in for a great movie since Jackie Chan was in it. My oh my was I wrong. This movie is complete crap from beginning to end. It feels like it lasts for about 3 hours and all those 3 hours are filled with nonsense. Why is Jackie Chan in this movie? I really don't know, but he shouldn't, because the movie sucks. They have added Looney Tunes sound clips in order to make it funny. So when someone in the movie gets hit in the head you feel like you are watching roadrunner, except this isn't funny. I feel really stupid buying this movie on DVD but just so you know, I will sell it as soon as I can because I don't want this movie in my collection. So if you are in the mood for some good Jackie Chan action, don't rent or buy this movie. If you are over 14 years old I can't figure out how it would be possible to like this movie. I rate this movie 2/10
