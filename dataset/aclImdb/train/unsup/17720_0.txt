While the characters in the Dr. Kildare films are quite likable as is the dialog, a major problem in some of the early films in the series is that Kildare just doesn't behave very logically and yet the films work out in the end (sort of like Curious George, now that I think about it). In one, the doctor treats a gunshot victim and doesn't disclose this to the police--even though this violated the law and should have resulted in either criminal prosecution or loss of license or both. In two others, Kildare behaves like a psychiatrist, even though he has no training in the field and once again, he's right and everyone else is wrong. It seems that there is nothing that this young doc can't do! In DR. KILDARE GOES HOME, fortunately, there is a greater sense of logic to the film and as a result, this film didn't make me want to throw something at my TV.<br /><br />The film begins with Kildare calling home to talk with his father. However, once again, the older doctor isn't home. Due to his mother's tone of voice, he assumes something is amiss despite her assertions that everything is fine, so he hops a train home. There, he finds that his dad is working himself to exhaustion because a nearby town has lost their doctors and so he now has a ton of new patients. Young Kildare comes up with an idea to create a clinic in this town to relieve his father's burden. Unfortunately, there seems to be a lot of resistance and the town seems quite happy working Kildare, Sr. to death! What will they do?! Overall, a very good addition to the series as logic (for once) prevails.
