I watched the entire series 1 and 2 whilst I was supposed to finish my thesis - nagging deadlines, raging teachers and what not could not dissuade me from watching this first, then finish my Master's degree - one has to set priorities! The series is brilliant for a number of reasons: 1. The animation. Admittedly not as brilliant as the movies, but I didn't expect that either: series work on a lower budget per minute of animation produced. Considering that, what they've achieved is just so magnificently well executed, it just took my breath away.<br /><br />2. The soundtrack. Both title tracks are sung by Origa, and by Jove, are those song 'hooks': even if you donlt care for anime or watching TV anyhow, these tracks glue you to the screen form the first second you hear them. Good job.<br /><br />3. The Plot & Philosophy. Even though I've seen series with a bit more 'driving' plots (these series being certain seasons of X-files, Millennium and Buffy the Vampire Slayer), the overarching polt is just amazing. I spent half my days googling all the hints, reading 'Catcher in the Rhye' and Baudrillard and more, just to make sure I wouldn't miss any possible hint or twist.<br /><br />4. Philosophy & the Future. Next to the philosophical underpinnings of the plot, there's also the technicological future the makers foresee. Whereas in the movies we got to see more of the development of 'individuality' under the advancements of technology, we get to see more of the development of 'society', harking back to the original manga-series a bit more. Here also the production team show their intellectual savvy. Although they saved the guest appearance for Donna Haraway for the movie 'Innocence', this series has 'Cyborg Manifesto' written all over it. But their vision goes even beyond these more airy abstract questions: the picture they paint of what the everyday details of future life would be like, are just so incredibly real and on target, it just blows your mind away.<br /><br />I truly believe that this series accurately describes what our future looks like - and every time I hear a news item stating that 'scientists have succeeded in linking this and this computer programme directly to the human brain' or 'more and more shops are opening up in Second Life' or whatever, I now constantly think: we're one step closer to Ghost in the Shell. So, even if you don't like anime, go see this. You'll see your own future.
