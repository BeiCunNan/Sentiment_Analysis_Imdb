This is by far the best small budget picture this year, if not ever. This movie will win awards, the players will receive nominations. I cannot possibly say enough about this picture. Redgrave was perfect. Margot Kidder, unbelievable... what a casting job. She alone is worth the 12 dollars. James Earl Jones wrestling nothing, falling on the floor...even his Jamaican accent was believable. What dialogue! What a script. From start to finish this one is a masterpiece.
