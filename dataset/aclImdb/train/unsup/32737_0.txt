This mini-series takes everything that was original in the books and replaces it with a clich√©. It takes everything that was unique in the books and replaces it with something generic. It takes everything that was true in the books and replaces it with something false. The women exist only as extensions of the men -- they are endlessly willing to sacrifice themselves or to perform menial tasks. They are fooled by tricks that wouldn't fool a ten year old and praised for completing tasks that a six year old could complete with ease. And yet, the mini-series is most popular with women under 18 or over 45. I wonder what that tells us. By the way, someone should tell the writer, who seems to specialize in ruining classic fantasy written by women, that "grasp" and "last" don't rhyme.<br /><br />Rick Norwood sfsite
