I saw this movie quite some time ago. I am only moved to write this review because of the impending release of Next Friday, which must be stopped at all costs. This movie was just awful in every possible way. For proof of this, one only needs to note that even Chris Tucker couldn't make it funny. Ice Cube just sucked. He's one of the best MC's of all time, but he can't write or act for beans. Back to Compton, Cube!<br /><br />I know I'll be dismissed by a lot of people as some whiteboy who doesn't know what it's like to live in the ghetto and doesn't see the multiple humorous levels of an old, constipated man grunting. If that's what you think, then just catch it next time on TNT (don't rent it, like I did) and post at least one funny line. Hell, post anything that didn't have you either sleeping or puking and I'll reneg on all these comments and eat my keyboard to boot.<br /><br />In any case, I'm already feeling queasy and tired just remembering this movie. Kill Next Friday! Kill!
