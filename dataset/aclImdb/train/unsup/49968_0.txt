I must say I don't like this version, just as the original version also seems a bit lame to me. The original was a big hit here in DK, and so I expected something exraordinary, but it wasn't. This is the Hollywood'ized version, but that doesn't make it any better - on some points it is even worse than the danish version. Not impressed, no, not at all... :-/
