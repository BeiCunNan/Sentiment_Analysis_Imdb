There were a million different ways this film could have gone and, subsequently, improved. However, this "Carpool" runs out of gas early on.<br /><br />Tom Arnold can be funny, I've seen him do it. And there are parts in "Carpool" where he is, in fact, funny. But the whole storyline is just a line of desperation on which this movie hangs situations that just don't stay up. <br /><br />And what in all that is holy's name are actual actors like Paymer and Steiger doing here? They can be funny on occasion, but not here; you just spend your time scratching your head, wondering how bad they needed the money.<br /><br />As it is, one long car chase, punctuated by the kids thinking Arnold isn't such a bad guy after all while dad Paymer insists they "stop being nice to the criminal" (okay, I liked that part).<br /><br />Two stars. And if I never see Steiger dressed like a clown again, that's fine with me.
