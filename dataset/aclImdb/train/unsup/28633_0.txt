This film is an absolutely evil and bad as I think that absolutely is not better than ever not to spread the example. These are my reasons. First: It is evil and reprehensible confuse environmentalists who are against the monstrosity of placing a tower of oil extraction off the coast of California that use of their legitimate rights are converted into manifestation of the "bad", confusing its leader with a terrible terrorist who wants to wipe out the United States simply for money. Second: Not content to makers of this absurdity is that a bomb has painted a hammer and sickle, the universal emblem of communism coincided with the former Soviet Union. As in the best times of the Cold War, and in the absence of more credible and convincing enemies have no reserves to use these despicable methods to manipulate the brains of people who have the misfortune to run into this crap that in the absence of arguments using weapons, explosions, shooting, violence absolutely free and what is worse, using the figure of a child and noble sentiments that are prostitutes to raise money.In possession of a genuine ingenuousness I wonder, how is it possible that there are people who can devote to a movie so bad? No wonder, then, that ordinary people do not go to theaters to see this movies, much less to see films such low value free of any film and ethical value.
