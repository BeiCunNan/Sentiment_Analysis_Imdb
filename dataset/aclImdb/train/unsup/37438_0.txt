There is really very little to recommend this film. It's like an extended episode of Scooy Doo with a bit of gore. A cast of relative unknowns (all of them, apart from the girl from The Sopranos) injured to some extent by their falls out of the ugly tree (a younger Paul Rudd lookalike with a wonky eye?) <br /><br />You really don't care who lives or dies - in fact I was hoping they'd all be dead by the end. In a movie with a runtime of 83 minutes before the credits roll, you'd expect the first main character would die a little sooner than 60 minutes in. Instead we have to suffer an hour of overacting and bad dialogue. The main 'twist' is blatantly obvious from the point at which they give the first 'clue' (they may as well have had Bill holding up a sign saying 'I am the younger brother' for all the subtlety it contained). There is no tension, generic scares from things suddenly popping out at you (in a ghost train, who'da thunk it?) and some of the gore effects look like they were done 25 years ago. When Jen takes off her shirt for the obligatory breast-shot, the camera pans up and down her torso for NO other reason than to get a close up. It's not sexy, it's like watching a medical documentary, or when the woman runs across the screen in Airplane! - it's that pointless.<br /><br />The ending is ridiculous, the film just STOPS, like they ran out of money and couldn't afford to film anymore. There are more plot holes than a graveyard. Don't bother with this movie.
