Hilarious. <br /><br />Not the film, but the review by RAROME when he calls the film, "One of the funniest Latino Exploitation films ever." He WOULD think that. He's the star of the film. <br /><br />Rarome posts elsewhere: "yes I'm Richard Azurdia and everyone can know it. I have nothing to hide." http://imdb.com/title/tt0452703/board/thread/19924618?d= 29238104#29238104<br /><br />Has anyone out there, NOT related to the filmmakers/not crew, cast, friends, or family of this film seen it and care to comment on it?
