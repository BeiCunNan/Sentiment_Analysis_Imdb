I caught this movie a long time ago, late at night, and I really enjoyed it. It just worked for me and was a lot of fun. This movie has a guy's fianc√© kidnapped by some weird cop. Turns out this cop is from hell and he has taken the girl to be Satan's new bride. The guy gets some help from an old gentleman who apparently had the same thing happen to him. The old man gives the guy a gun and the guy goes to hell to get back his girl. The movie does really well at presenting hell for an obviously low budget movie. You get the feeling you are in another world. There is plenty of action and comedy here too, though not much in the way of horror. The guy gets some help here and there and runs into various obstacles along his way and he gets to see the many sights and sounds that hell has to offer. My personal favorite was the road of good intentions. This movie goes at a good clip too, and it rarely slows down and there are a few twists along the way as well. The movie for me works on almost every level and if you ever have a chance to watch this little gem do so.
