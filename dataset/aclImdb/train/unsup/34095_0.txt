What exactly is the point of this boring, predictable, cliche-ridden little zit of a film? Are we to be subjected henceforth to the home movies of everyone under age 30? Is this to be our new Inferno? Chris Noth is good but doesn't seem to be in the same film with anyone else. The rest look like they're trying to remake from memory one of Woody Allen's lesser "serious" efforts.
