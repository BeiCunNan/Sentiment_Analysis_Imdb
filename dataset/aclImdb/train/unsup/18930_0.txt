Okay, I'll admit that it is the ONLY gay Avant Garde Biblical film I have ever seen,...but by default it is definitely the best. It's a pretty strange little film, though compared to the rest of the short films from the Kino Video Avant Garde collection, it's pretty "normal" and approachable for the average viewer. However, I am really not sure exactly who the audience is for this strange art film. After all, gay audiences probably won't enjoy all the religious content and Bible verses--especially when the people of Sodom are damned. And, due to the homo-erotic imagery, most deeply religious people will be at least super-duper hesitant to watch the film! So, unless you really want something very different and pretty oddly creative, this film probably won't be one that will change your life or get to to watch it more than once. I gotta say, though, that the inventive camera-work is pretty cool and the film is in many ways like a piece of Pop Art.<br /><br />If you ARE looking for an "artsy" film but find this type of film I described sounds too unusual or esoteric, maybe you should try the films of the great French artist/director Jean Cocteau. Other than his BLOOD OF A POET, his other films combine artistry and Avant Garde imagery with well-constructed plots and familiar movie elements. My favorites of his films are Orphée (Orpheus) and La Belle et la bête (Beauty and the Beast).
