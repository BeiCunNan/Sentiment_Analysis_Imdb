A not very-original story of two young people who fall in love and go through pretty much the exact same things all young couples deal with in real life or the movies. <br /><br />The dialog is trite and, dare I say it again, unoriginal. <br /><br />Cutesy devices -- like the narration, like the characters addressing the camera (Fourth Wall! We Need You!) are overdone, badly done, and grating. <br /><br />Amateurish in every respect.<br /><br />Why a 3? The secondaries -- the Orson Welles-like guy, the Selma Blair porn star girl, Freddie's roommate, and the pot girl. How about a movie about these people, instead of the cookie-cutter romcom leads (yawn).<br /><br />Watch out for Ashton Kutcher as Jim Morrison. Seriously.
