Wow I have seen a lot of movies but this one takes the cake-it is without a doubt the worse movie i have ever seen. I rented it last night with a friend. I love Meryl Streep and I like Uman Thurman in Kill Bill and Bryan Greenberg is pretty hot. Well the acting in this movie was horrible. The plot was incredibly predictable and the one inners that were injected in a feeble attempt to gain a laugh only made me feel embarrassed for both the character and the actor. And then the ending is so abrupt you are left there wondering why you just wasted an hour and 40 minutes on this film-seriously I want that time back in my life. Do not watch this film! Maybe my purpose of seeing it is to warn others not to waste their time.
