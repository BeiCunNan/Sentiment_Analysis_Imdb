I can't say anything bad about the film. It has so many good people that were connected in making the film. That it overshadows any bad thoughts that I could have about it. I really wish that a sequel could be made. I plan to go and visit some of the cast and crew members this summer. To the remaining cast and crew that are still around if you see this comment. I really appreciate your work.
