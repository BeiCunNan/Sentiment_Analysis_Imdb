Pure suspense and entertainment in "Suddenly!" Sinatra superb as was the complete cast. Excellent direction by Lewis Allen. The formula, of course, is hostages held in terror by gunmen with Sinatra as their leader. He is going to snipe the president from the window of the captives house.<br /><br />Certainly one of the better Film Noir productions.
