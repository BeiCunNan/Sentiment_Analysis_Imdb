Fann Wong (Yes, weird name) . Just because some industry bigwig thought she was photogenic and popular with teenagers, she was cast in this picture. Peter Ho is a singer by trade and this is his first time acting. Though they look like they could sell toothpaste together, they certainly can't sell movies. This movie was a thorough waste of time and it nearly bored me to tears in the cinema.<br /><br />"The truth about Jane and Sam" is a totally shallow work employing the oldest plot in the book. A cynical, jaded woman (Fann Wong) in Hong Kong, meets Singaporean journalist(Peter Ho). At first they don't like one another, then he finds she is actually a sweet, nice girl inside. Then they end up going to bed. The next morning, POW! she is in the kitchen (how domestic) , making him breakfast.<br /><br />This is just a movie to cheat impressional teenagers of their allowances. By the way, the soundtrack sucks too. Thank goodness they didn't let Fann Wong sing the theme song. . Watch this movie at your own peril.
