This is an excellent film. The character development is delicately wrapped in the plot and very richly told. What unfolds is a very sensitive portrayal of the loneliness and hunger that drive a sometimes unfounded sense of optimism drowning in indulgence. Everything about this movie struck a positive chord within me. It's flawless, meaning, not one scene made me wince.<br /><br />Steve B is a both a tremendous writer, actor and director.
