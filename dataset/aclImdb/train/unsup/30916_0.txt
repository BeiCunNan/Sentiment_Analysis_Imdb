This movie made no sense. One of the major plot points was for the aliens to find children (in the present time) that could "hear" them and take them to another world before the cataclysmic end of our planet. So why did they need to appear 50 years ago and leave a cryptic message with dates of varying catastrophes? Just so Cage's character can figure it out and let his kid go? How about all the other ships with other kids? They get their own puzzles? How come the girl who was able to hear them 50 years ago was not part of the expeditionary force but instead was left to suffer for all her life? In other words, everything leading up to the end of the movie was not a necessary element for the ending. No logic here at all and a real downer of a movie. A couple of stars given for special effects (which for the most part had nothing to do with the premise of the movie). Shame, because I almost always like what Nicholas Cage does.
