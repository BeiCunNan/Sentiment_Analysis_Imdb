This film makes one wonder why the Americans hadn't made it to Berlin by the end of 1941. A loudmouthed NCO and a few other Allied soldiers fight off hundreds of German crack troops at a desert well. How on earth did Rommel get to El Alamein? The original, starring Humphrey Bogart, was bad enough, although considering that it was made during the war, it probably served its purpose as a propaganda piece. To do a re-make (and do it thus badly) is simply inexcusable. If Americans learn about the war by watching movies like this one they will fail to understand why it took so long to defeat Hitler. And why should an Australian captain take orders from an American sergeant? It just doesn't make sense. I can well picture a US NCO TRYING to bully a commissioned Australian (or British) officer around - what I can't imagine in my wildest dreams is the officer taking the orders. I suppose the only reason Napoleon lost the Battle of Waterloo was that he didn't have an American sergeant by his side who'd have given him the right orders. What a load of rubbish this film is!
