After the end of the film my first thought was "What's the point?". And although the film kinda ends abruptly, I knew it was ending the moment Breslin says "I love you". To be honest, this film made me feel very uncomfortable, luckily I watched it alone, and i FFWD through the beginning a lot, since it is embarrassing to watch and every second you expect this guy to make even more of a fool of himself than he is doing. Of course, that fact alone gives away that the acting is great, and it really is. Of course Breslin is her usual greatness, but here Lewis definitely takes the cake. He is superb!<br /><br />This film looks low budget, but I was wondering all through the movie how much extras were used, and they were all extras, since none of them looked into the camera. I'd really hate that.<br /><br />The beginning is really hard to watch, even though I like indie movies, with a lack of background music, but it is just that the character Keane is extremely unappealing in his madness, or supposed madness. It is a good thing that the film doesn't provide a prêt-à-porter answer to it's major questions, like : Is he really crazy, is it a dream, is the Kira the girl he really lost instead of Sophie? Because, at one time, I had the feeling that there was a flashback structure, that the beginning was really the end of the story and that Kira was the girl he lost, upon which he lost his mind and mistook her for Sophie, his real daughter who is apparently unavailable to him because of a divorce. In that sense I was a little surprised, which was nice.<br /><br />All in all, a quality film which is not easy on the eyes, except with the non-nude sex scene. That scene throws you off, cause it indicates that he's not quite the deplorable character he seems to be in the beginning. In that sense, it is debatable whether Lewis is a miscast since he has this typical middle-class suburban image, and not an outsider/fringe/loner. That is puzzling.
