As a James Marsters fan he was the reason I bought this film but after realising he's not in it that much I really got into the actual story and really enjoyed it. Its a sweet story of love, heartache and the pains of becoming mature and responsible.<br /><br />I'm not really a lover of Rachel Hunter's acting but I was surprised to learn her character was by far the best and most complex and the writing for her character (as well as the others) was pretty special.<br /><br />This is the perfect film for a rainy Sunday afternoon particularly if you've experienced any type of loss be it love, a death or that sweet innocent belief of true love and happy ever afters.<br /><br />For Marsters fans this film is very different to anything you would expect of him and really highlights how talented an actor he truly is.
