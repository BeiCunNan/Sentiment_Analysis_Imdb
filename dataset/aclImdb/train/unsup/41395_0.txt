It's unoriginal, badly written, and downright racist at times, but Carrie Fisher made me laugh out loud several times ("They're your bitches" is my favorite, but you have to watch the movie for the set-up). Almost all of the Mexican characters were the usual stock stereotypes, from the corrupt, bumbling cops to mama and the big family throwing a fiesta. But that said, the scenery and the lead actors were pretty to look at. Pleasant enough to watch if there's nothing else on and you're willing to let your brain turn to mush. If you liked that dreadful Matthew Perry/Salma Hayek movie from about 10 years ago, then you'll probably be able to sit through this one.
