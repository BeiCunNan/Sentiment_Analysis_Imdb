A greatly subdued Ida Luppino gives another wonderful performance as a backwoods girl suffering with a nasty father and mother who has been long suffering as a result of his abuse.<br /><br />Luppino does an excellent job as the girl who stutters to her frustrations in life.<br /><br />She falls for Dane Clark, who is a prisoner and escapes during a landslide. Pursued by the police, Luppino offers him help as the two fall deeply in love. Clark's problems seems to be environment oriented. He is not a cruel, vicious man but just a guy whose temper allowed him to run afoul of the law.<br /><br />Fay Bainter gives another wonderful supporting performance as the long suffering mother. Equally good is Wayne Morris, as a cop who also falls for Luppino.<br /><br />While tragedy beckons at the end, life does go on as the picture shows. Dane Clark is great here and he would always excel in taking parts of troubled men.
