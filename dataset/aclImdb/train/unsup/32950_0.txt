This is a difficult film to review as it's really the first of it's type. Using only computer graphics, it attempts to create real looking and believable characters in a futuristic Anime setting. Unlike 'Toy Story' and it's followers, this movie isn't trying to look like a cartoon, but like a live action film with human actors.<br /><br />Considering it from this point of view, it's a stunning achievement. At times I found myself forgetting I was watching computer graphics - it really is that well done. The level of detail in the faces and the character movement is especially impressive, although at times it didn't feel quite right (on a few rare occasions it looked quite bad.) <br /><br />If we look at the film aside from the technical achievement, it doesn't fare as well. The plot is very Japanese influenced which is a good thing. We're saturated by American movies and it's refreshing to see something off beat. Unfortunately it feels watered down, as if it's Japanese origins have been diluted by American influence. As a result it ends up being neither Japanese Anime or American Sci-Fi Action - I would have liked it to have been a bit more way out, a bit more daring. <br /><br />Like the plot, the acting is weak. Facial expressions are extremely important in conveying feelings and the technology isn't quite there. The voice acting was good but it's difficult to empathise with the characters.<br /><br />I'd talk about the sets and costumes etc - but there weren't any right?<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a film I'd recommend to everyone. If you're interested in computer graphics, Anime or Sci-Fi - give it a try.
