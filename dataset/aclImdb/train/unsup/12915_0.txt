Topper Returns is the funniest old movie I have ever seen. I have seen it several times, and each and every time it has kept me in stitches. Topper Returns is a murder mystery/comedy, that will keep you in suspense until the end. Joan Blondell is at her best in this one, and Billie Burke will keep you in stitches as the ditzy Mrs. Topper.
