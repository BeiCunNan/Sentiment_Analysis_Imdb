We all know what happens in cartoons when cats try to catch mice, but what happens when the mice want the cat to eat them? That's just what happens in "Cheese Chasers". Wise-guy rodents Hubie and Bertie have just eaten way too much cheese and feel that they can't eat any more of the stuff. With nothing left to live for, they try to get Claude the Cat to devour them, but he doesn't want to. Feeling that he can never eat another mouse again, he tries to get a bulldog to eat him, but that leads to pure confusion on the dog's part, to the point where all four characters end up doing something that no mouse, cat or dog would probably ever consider! I don't think that I've seen all the Hubie and Bertie cartoons, but this one is a really fun romp. With all sorts of gags, there isn't a dull moment in it. And you may just feel hungry for cheese after watching it (don't eat too much, mind you; you don't want to do what these characters did!).<br /><br />Two thousand years. Yeah, I guess that life's like that.
