<br /><br />For some inexplicable circumstances or reasons which are known only to the BBC, this film has never been released to the public. Had I not had the opportunity to see it on PBS Channel WNET in New York several years ago, I would not have known of its existence. It is time that the BBC made some effort to consider their audience and the needs of teachers and students alike - not to mention all the adult persons in the world that are being treated to a declining quality of films and television programs. This film not only carefully and faithfully covers the life and times of Darwin, one of the greatest scientists of all time, but it lays before the viewer a very precise overview of Darwin's theories of species orgins and the principles of evolution. I wonder, as do others, if the disappearance of this film has anything to do with the fanatics of the so-called 'Christian' right that sees the work of science as a threat to their tawdry and ignorant grasp of science and scientific principles. Someone out there: make this film available to any and all who cannot fail to enjoy it and profit from its salutary content. Is anyone listening?
