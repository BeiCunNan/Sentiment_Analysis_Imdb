"Bleeder" following "Pusher" is the second part of a trilogy. Like "Pusher" it's really powerful stuff, but not quite as gripping. Leo( Kim Bodina) gives a wonderful portrait of a disturbed man at odds with life. He teases, insults, provokes, has a violent temper and is quick to retaliate. Not a man to be trusted with a gun. He is his own worst enemy.<br /><br />In the film the "fades" are done in blood red. See the film and you'll discover why. As in "Pusher" the photography is top class. The introduction of the characters in the opening scene is interesting, Shoes probably do reflect our character.<br /><br />Despite the rather sordid unhappy atmosphere of the film. there is some light relief particularly in the video store where the young Lenny (Mads Mikkelsen) sorts the video "returns". Lenny is a misfit too but harmless in his own way. Shy of nature he can't keep an appointment with the girl in the coffee shop. Lenny lives in a fantasy world of films and videos and he can recite the names of all the directors. (This never-ending recitation done with a dead pan expression is an unexpected bonus and really got me laughing!}<br /><br />I like the dialogue. It's sparse, direct, tense, cutting, provoking. But it's the body language that threatens. Kim Bodina is an expert at revealing the innermost thoughts of his being. You can feel the tense atmosphere boiling within him. You know full well that something terrible is about to happen.<br /><br />This is drama plus. I can hardly wait for the third part of the trilogy.
