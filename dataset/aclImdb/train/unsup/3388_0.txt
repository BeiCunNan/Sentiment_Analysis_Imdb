This film will go down as a truly important and remembered film in SciFi. It is along the order of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. The Extra Terrestrial.<br /><br />People who only like Action/Adventure flicks won't have enough brain cells to get it, but true SciFi fans (the types who can read books too) will love this film. It's very powerful and emotional.<br /><br />It had some minor problems as any film does. There were some weak acting moments and a poor edit that should have been cut tighter, but in general it was excellent.<br /><br />In particular, 6yr old newcomer Rhiannon Leigh Wryn as the lead character Emma Wilder did a wonderful job. Unbelievable that a 6 year old child could be that effective in a role.<br /><br />I highly recommend this well written and directed film. It's one to remember.
