I saw this movie when it first aired on television many years ago.I was around fourteen years old.My sister was sick with breast cancer,and it made a huge impact on me.I read the book later, after I had seen the movie.This movie was beautifully filmed, and I thought that it stayed close to the original book.The script was very intelligent, and the actors portrayed their roles perfectly.I love the sets.To see the beautiful countryside in some of the scenes was fantastic.The music in this movie was one of the wonderful attributes to the story.I find myself humming the songs all of the time, after all of these years.I found the soundtrack, and I listen to it all of the time.Cliff De Young, Christina Raines,Meg Foster,Billy Mumy and Brenda Vaccaro were excellent.The other cast members were great too.I always cry when I watch this movie.I recommend this movie highly to people that have never seen it,I have this movie.
