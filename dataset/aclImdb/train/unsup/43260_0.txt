Although I didn't expect a masterpiece, I at least hoped for a bit of wit, considering the writer and the cast. However, I was sorely disappointed.<br /><br />It started horribly when you realised the central character was going to be using a fake Australian accent throughout the film. After that, irritation turned to despair as a feeble plot, uninteresting characters, an excruciating script and very sad jokes were unleashed on the unfortunate audience.<br /><br />If you ever get a chance to see this film, run away as fast as you can.
