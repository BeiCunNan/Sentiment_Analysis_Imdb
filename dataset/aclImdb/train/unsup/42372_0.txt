Pretty dreadful franchisy sequel. Apart from Dahan's (French) meditative camera-work inbetween stock action filming there's absolutely nothing original about this film at all. To name all the contrivances and their lineage would be as boring as the film itself: suffice to say that if you've seen Bond, Indiana Jones and The.., Seven and even The Matrix you've probably covered most of this.<br /><br />Of the cast, Magimel has the 'cute' of Cassel (from the first) but not his charisma. Reno is the one holding it together, although his ennui is rather more phoned-in for this one. And simply putting Christopher Lee in a film - doing his sect-leader yet again - does not rubber-stamp it with integrity (he's left out to dry almost as much as the redundant chick-interest, Natta).<br /><br />I did, however, enjoy an unwittingly (?) postmodern thrill-sequence set in the supermarket. If only there were more of this invention 3/10
