this movie failed on so many levels. first of all, the story was not great, though a pregnant godzilla was a nice twist.<br /><br />matthew broderick tried valiantly, but he just could not bring any credibility to his dialogue. he almost sounded embarrassed to be sayiing some of his lines!<br /><br />the lead actress maria pitillo seemed to try and get by on cuteness rather than any acting talent. a worse cryer i have not seen in a loooong time. she sucked.<br /><br />besides broderick and the army general or whatever he was, most of the characters were basically bit players. the movie just didn't work.<br /><br />and then there was godzilla. visually excellent looking. but the evil (sort of), tokyo trashing, soldier eating, building stomping godzilla from the classic movies was reduced to an over sized velociraptor. where the original godzilla took on the military face to face, the new godzilla played a game of cat and mouse. not near as much fun. the movie portrayed godzilla as a crafty but mindless animal, so that when they finally killed him, the audience is saddened rather than happy about it. godzillas eggs and their hatching, stolen directly from aliens, isn't even suspenseful.we all know that as soon as broderick puts his ear up to a shell, it will obviously crack open. and why oh why would the baby godzillas be more attracted to the smell of dead fish on the humans than the dead fish themselves?<br /><br />this movie sucked. that's all i can say. so many holes in the plot, bad acting, poor story, and illogical plot devices don't even make it worth seeing the fx.<br /><br />yuck.
