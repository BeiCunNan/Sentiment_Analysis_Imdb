This video nastie was eventually released in Britain with 2 seconds cut. Those two seconds must have had all of the action because there was really nothing left in this movie that would qualify it as a nasty.<br /><br />Some Vietnam soldiers are trapped in a cage and they get an opportunity to gnaw on some flesh. That is the only nudity you see in the film - 2 seconds. One of them bites his Captain's (John Saxon) arm when being rescued and he has the dormant virus that will come to haunt him in later years.<br /><br />For some reason, the two soldiers never fully recover and they go on a rampage that is tame by cannibal standards. The police end up chasing them all in a sewer, but our hero escapes and puts on his uniform for an honorable death.<br /><br />You can be sure they did not get them all, but I don't know if there was an Apocalypse II.
