Almost a decade after Wes Craven's original shocker - he directed this lesser known and largely inferior sequel. If I didn't know better, I'd say part 2 was trying to make the original look better by comparison. Yeah - it's that bad! It is about a group of dirt bikers who travel by bus out into the desert to race. They, of course, end up encountering the remaining members of the cannibalistic family living in the hills, which are just Pluto (Michael Berryman) and his uncle - some big guy named Reaper. Unlike the 1977 classic, this sequel is basically just a lack luster 80s slasher with minimal gore and a depressingly small amount of nudity. Seeing Berryman riding around on a dirt bike was probably one of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen and his dialogue sound much to intelligent for a semi retarded inbred. That Reaper guy was funny and the only thing I actually enjoyed about the movie. He looked like a wrestler with Down Syndrome. If you are like me and love the original than there is NO need to punish yourself by watching this crap... Avoid!
