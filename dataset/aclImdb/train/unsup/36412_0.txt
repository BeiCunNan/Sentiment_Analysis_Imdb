The only thing that kept me watching this turkey was the belief (fervent dream) that this sucker was going to improve, hopefully, dramatically. But...no..it..did..not...<br /><br />There were some approaches to good action but they all fell short of Indiana Jones which the movie obviously impersonated, at least at times.<br /><br />There was the usual Computer Generated Imagery made famous by the Mummy movies but that was impersonation on an amateurish level. This entire movie was like that - copycat and poorly made.<br /><br />It makes me wonder how it got financial backing. Did someone lose a bet? Was blackmail employed in order to get funding? Extortion with a 9 millimeter to someone's head?
