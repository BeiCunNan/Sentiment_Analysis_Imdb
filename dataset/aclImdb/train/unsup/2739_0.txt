The series is kind of like Starsky and Hutch meets Planet of the Apes. Two astronauts end up on earth in the future (I hope this does not count as a spoiler) and befriend a chimpanzee. One of the astronauts is the young wise cracking guy, the other one the more serious and considerate older guy. This means of course that the overall feeling of doom which the films had is not really present here. The sets are quite decent as is the make up which is of course because they used sets and props from the films. Overall, it's actually fairly entertaining and well made, certainly much better than the last two installments of the film franchise. However, there is a limit as to how far you can stretch the underlying storyline and therefore it tends to be a bit repetitive. There is only so much you can do with one idea. But by and large it's well made entertainment, worth watching.
