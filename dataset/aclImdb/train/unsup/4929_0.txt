This was an excellent series and is still relevant today. It tackled social issues such as abortion, the right to die (think of Rose) and the woman's role in society as well as racial issues, and those issues are still so relevant today. It was extremely well made and paid great attention to detail. The director even went to the trouble of turning off the air conditioning in the studios to get a realistic effect, this made the actors very irritable but gave a realistic view of what life must have been like under those conditions. <br /><br />I have all three series on DVD and watch them about once a year. I thoroughly enjoy the entire series and would recommend it to anyone interested in world war two.
