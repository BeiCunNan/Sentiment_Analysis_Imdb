After watching Rown & Martins Laugh In I expected something better than this. There are a few humor touches but I really thought the scenes with Rowan & Martin doing stand-up including in the opening credits would have been better.<br /><br />The plot such as it is is strange in that there are no vampires next door even though plot synopsis of the movie says there is. The center of the plot has to do with a large diamond everybody is looking for, yet at the end we are never quite sure if it was found or not.<br /><br />Some major continuity moments happen when the film jumps from day to night suddenly & some of the scenes ending & the next one beginning make no sense either. This would have been better if they had stuck more to comedy & less with a plot that falls kind of flat.<br /><br />This film does have some well known television folks. Carol Lynnely was better known for other films & isn't given much script in this. Julie Newmar is best known as a Catwoman on TVs Batman. Even though she is already 36 in this one, for many years she was ageless in the beauty department. She is the only cast member who worked with another comedy team Noonan & (Peter) Marshall during the 1950's.<br /><br />Leon Askin is better known for Hogan's Heros roles. Robert Reed in a small supporting role is more known for Mr. Mike Brady.<br /><br />For Rowan & Martin fans, this is OK. Both of them get to use Dick Martins line "I didn't know that!" The opening & closing of the film are bits of whimsy, but the rest is only sporadically funny. Say Good Night Dick.
