This version of Tennessee Williams brilliant masterpiece The Glass Menagerie is utter crap. It is an insult to his brilliance. With all the changes made from the original play script, Williams' meaning and themes are completely lost, and the movie makes absolutely no sense. Yes it was a good first attempt at putting one of Tennessee William's plays on screen, but they did not need to change it. I do not recommending watching this movie if you are a fan of The Glass Menagerie. Watching this version and watching other versions of the same play many things seem to be grossly misunderstood. for example making Laura normal, she is not normal she is crippled mentally and physically. Amanda would not have yelled at the store clerk, it is against her southern genteel ways. The way the movie begins is all wrong, Tom doesn't begin telling the story just because he is bored, he tells the story to help him get rid of the memory of Laura, to an extent.the use of different locations takes away from the theme of escape. in the stage version there is only one set, the apartment, we as the audience are never meant to see the other places these characters go. by doing this is negates the idea and concept of a memory play. For the 1950s it was probably a great success, but it comes at the cost of loosing the integrity that Tennessee Williams out forth in his play.
