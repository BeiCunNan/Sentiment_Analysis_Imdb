Movies like this should be outlawed, or at least come with a warning. I have never left a movie before, but this was too much. I was dry-heaving after the movie was over, and thought i was going to throw up. Not only was the theme of the story grotesque and repulsive, but there was absolutely no plot. I was going to ask for a refund after seeing this vile work, but it's not the theater's fault for letting trash like this into society.
