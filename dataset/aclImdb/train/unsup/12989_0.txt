A great psychological thriller. Tony Todd is excellent as The Candyman, and his deep voice is great when he is talking, it is menacing and he just sounds evil. The story is great and their is a lot of suspense. The story is Helen and her friend are investigating urban legends for university. They investigate the legend of the Candyman. Say his name five times in the mirror and he'll turn up and make you sorry for even thinking his name. When the Candyman begins to stalk Helen, she almost breaks down because he continues to commit murders and frame her. It is truly terrifying. A truly great movie and a must see for people looking for a movie that makes you think and scares you at the same time.
