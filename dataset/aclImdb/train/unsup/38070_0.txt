Unlike the un-related mediocre other "urban legends" this movie fails to have a significant plot, bits are thrown in through the movie (without need for the average viewer)in order to convey this is a movie about urban legends. In reality it is a simple predictable "who dune it" movie with extracts of left over legends simple tossed in at nausea. The special effects define this movie as not straight-to-tape, but it will end up in the discount bin at your local asda very quickly. Although the cgi effects have been done to a suitable level they are so unrealistic it doesn't matter how well they are done (100 spiders managing to materialise overnight from a single spot). In summary this movie will have you longing for the end, it doesn't follow on from any of the previous movies but is a classic "modern film" unrealistic cgi, poor plots (predictable) weak acting, sometimes the crew actual sound like they are reading the script out loud. Its time for Hollywood to start producing decent films.
