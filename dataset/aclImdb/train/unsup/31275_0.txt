Even if this film had been a noble failure it would have been a notable moment in cinema history. The fact that it is a set in stone masterpiece means that its impact is redoubled. As the multi-layered narrative weaves it way from one uncomfortable moment to the next, via hidden camera scenes too, one 'Question' keeps repeating in your mind; how the hell did this ever get made? Forget that though, and just enjoy the fact that it did, because moments of sunshine are often all too rare, a fact emphasized throughout this film. "?" might be a different beast altogether, but it's certainly an American beauty; I challenge you not to be uplifted by as satisfying an ending as I can remember.
