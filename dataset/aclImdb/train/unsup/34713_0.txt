The stripper Rachel (Cherish Lee) is hit by a cab but survives in the emergency room of a hospital. However, she sees Death chasing her, but she does not succeed in convincing the nurses. She is drugged and wakes up in St. Joseph, a mental hospital administrated by Dr. Brown (Brent Fidler). She finds five other inmates that had a near death experience and also claim that Death is coming for them, but Dr. Brown tells them that they are subject of a mass hypnosis experiment. Meanwhile, Rachel's boyfriend and student of medicine Liam (Benjamin Pitts) seeks her nearby the night-club. While trying to escape from the facility, Rachel discloses the truth about Dr. Brown and St. Joseph.<br /><br />The very low-budget "Grim Reaper" has a promising weird beginning, with the confused state of mind of Rachel after the accident. However, the story shifts to a terrible and inconsistent rip-off of "Final Destination", with a messy and ridiculous screenplay. There are many flaws in the story, but the worse are: (1) Liam finds Rachel in St. Joseph and runs with her downstairs trying to find an exit. (2) How Rachel decides that she must die and face the Reaper? (3) How could a student of medical school accept the words of his stripper girlfriend that seems to be deranged and kill her in a death experiment? (4) Why Cherish Lee takes of f her overcoat after defeating the Reaper? As a stripper, she takes off only the winds of angel of her costume. The scariest scene is the conclusion with Rachel in the bathtub with an open end and a hook for a sequel. I like independent low-budget movies and horror is my favorite genre, but the story and screenplay of Ellis Walker is a lack of respect with viewers and cast. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Ceifador de Almas" ("Reaper of Souls")
