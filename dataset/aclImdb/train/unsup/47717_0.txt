This show is so full of double standards, hypocritical characters, and holier the thou attitudes. I can't even watch a commercial anymore.<br /><br />The way the parents spy on their children and their ridiculous over the top reactions is laughable.<br /><br />It they are "moral", than I don't know if I want to be in that category.<br /><br />It is kind of scary to me to think some people actually think these are good people with good morals.<br /><br />I am not surprise that most of the children have flown the coupe as fast as they could.
