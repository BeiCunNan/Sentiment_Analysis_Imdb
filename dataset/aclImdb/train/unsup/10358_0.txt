...and its still one of my favorites. The title doesn't really give an indication of what the movie is about. Tho the strangely preternatural rat co-star is indeed of 'UNKNOWN ORIGIN', it sounds more like a sci-fi title than a movie about Peter Weller being driven insane by an escalating rat problem in his house. Not just an ordinary rat problem, this rat is an advanced tactical model which manages to stay one step ahead of his human antagonist like some darkside Tom and Jerry cartoon.<br /><br />I even liked this better than the mother of all 'rat' movies, WILLARD. Weller can do no wrong in my book, hes consistently good and in fine 'Peter Weller' form here. Cant say I ever saw a theatrical release on this, possibly was direct to video. I have a copy somewhere that I recorded off HBO or something way back then. I didn't realize it was out on DVD, I'll have to track down a copy.
