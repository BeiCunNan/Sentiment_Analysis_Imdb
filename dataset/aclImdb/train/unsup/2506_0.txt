Lost treasure, old west cowboy ghouls, and great special effects. Probably equal parts horror, Western, and action/adventure. The story is based on the real-life legend of Tumacacori, an ancient Spanish lost treasure of gold, and is a fun romp through the Arizona desert. The music is scored well and moves the film nicely. Billy Drago is awesome as the wicked cavalry saber-wielding town Sheriff. Don't expect a typical blood and guts horror pic, there's more here to the legend, as the six convicts look for the lost gold and meet their untimely deaths. Great decapitation scene, and a very cool Harley Davidson/horse chase at the end. Rate it a six, maybe seven, but definitely worth watching.
