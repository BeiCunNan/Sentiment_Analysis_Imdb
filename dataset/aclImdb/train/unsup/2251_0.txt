I went to see this film despite awful reviews from some dutch newspapers. What a waste of time, this film is so boring I walked out after an hour. The director seems to think overlighting equals interesting filmmaking. It doesn't and to make things worse he tries to go back and forth in time, again thinking this would make for some interesting film. Again he's mistaken. He only manages to confuse and bore his viewers to death.<br /><br />Better to go see Y tu mama tambien, a much better film.
