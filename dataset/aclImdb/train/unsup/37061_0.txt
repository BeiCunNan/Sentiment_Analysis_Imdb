When I went to see Inkheart tonight I couldn't believe my eyes. I cannot believe that this is a result of such a great and wonderful book. It is common knowledge that movies are generally not as good as the books they're based off of... but this is in a league of its own.<br /><br />There was no character development - AT ALL! The story was re-written in a whole knew way, why bother calling it Inkheart? Let's not talk about the acting. I only understood what was going on because I read the book. A person who is not familiar with the story will not understand this movie.<br /><br />I am heartbroken that the author was even involved in this movie, and did allow this outcome. Maybe some books should just not be made into movies.
