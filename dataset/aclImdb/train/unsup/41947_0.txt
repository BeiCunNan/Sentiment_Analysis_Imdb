I saw this movie because it seemed like a good plot, I'm a horror fan, and I always take time to watch the movies of Dawson's Creek stars. It was a good idea to make a film about teens being brain-washed but I guess the producers assumed that since Katie Holmes was in the movie there was no need to actually put some work into the script.<br /><br />The actors, leaving out Nick Stahl, were lacking. James Marsden could have done better but it could have just been that the dialogue was poorly written. Who knows. Katie Holmes' bad girl act made her just seem like a bratty little tag-along.<br /><br />And of course they had to add some nudity to the flick just to make it "perfect". The showing of the girl's chest wasn't at all necessary.<br /><br />All in all, it was just a typical teen horror flick that was sloppily made. All pretty much done was taking a spookie urban legend, throw in some nudity, some running around into nowhere, an extremely popular star, and making a happy ending with a little corny twist at the end... BOOM... you just got yourself a poorly done teen flick. Rent The Faculty instead unless you are partial to Katie Holmes. I give this movie a 3/10 stars.
