Its a lot of fun watching the really fake shark that isn't scary at all,you will crack up when you see the shark coming out of the water with his head. There is also alot of documentary stuff used for this movie, that are maybe the most bad parts of the movie, the storyline is alot like "jaws". The acting is OK (not more then that) i give it 3/10, BUT IT IS FUN WATCHING THE SHARK !!!
