I heard so many good things about this movie that I thought "Oh, I've got to see that". Then I realised I'd rented it a couple of weeks before and rather enjoyed it. I can usually remember films very clearly but this one is so predictable that it had just evaporated from my memory. Still, it's certainly a well-acted story of social change in a small town (despite the loathsome, stodgy music - I hate brass bands) and worth a look. Incidentally, it's interesting that most of the pro-Thatcher comments have been written by Americans who would be unlikely to tolerate her born-to-rule attitude. An institution like the House of Lords wouldn't last a nanosecond in the liberty-loving USA, thank God!
