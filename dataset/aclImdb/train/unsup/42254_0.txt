I agree with the other imdb user. This PPV was the pits, ladder bout aside. The segments between Austin-Bischoff were amusing but we dont buy the PPVs to watch interviews. This was probably the worst card since King of the Ring 95 and that event was just inferior to this one. If you havent seen this event, DONT.
