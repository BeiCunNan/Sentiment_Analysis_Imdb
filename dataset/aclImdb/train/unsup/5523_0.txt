wow. I am so glad that I read one of the comment before i rented this movie. If I just followed the rating, I would have missed a great fun entertaining movie.<br /><br />I was gonna rate it a 8, however, since it only has a 3.1 i am gonna rate it a 10. it made me laugh so hard, and unlike some movies who make dirty jokes to make people laugh. this movie's storyline is generally authentic and believable.<br /><br />Every time when that guy mentions fraternal aid society, it just makes me laugh even harder. and their dialogues are well thought, very funny.<br /><br />however, i have to say that it is just a funny movie to watch, it doesn't have much of educational purposes,etc.
