Very funny, often hilarious comedy from regular writing team Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. "Night Shift" tells the tale of two young men, one very nervous and reserved, the other loud and over confident, who both work the night shift at the city morgue. All hell and hilarity break loose when the boys decide to go into business as pimps.<br /><br />Director Ron Howard is always in control of his stars and works the humour well, showing signs of a fine director. Although Michael Keaton is occasionally annoying, Henry Winkler is extremely likable as Charles Lumley III, a timid but brilliant financial wizard. Also starred Shelley Long. Comedy fans, don't miss this one.<br /><br />Tuesday, July 2, 1991 - Video
