I've seen this movie at a festival and i just hate it. I've seen lots of movies in black-white, or documentary etc. but none of them was as boring as this movie. It was not a movie actually, it was just a crazy woman talking about how much she hates the God and how to make pasta by using craps... It was like, a torture, misery. I was like "please just stop" but the movie was not just so boring but also so long. There are lots of scenes that has nothing to say... There is no point... Once i was at a "movie workshop" and there was a guy teaching writing a scenario and he told us that "a movie is about the visions, it's about what you show people and what they see. If someone talks talks talks about life etc. it's not a movie. It's a video that you shot, but not a movie." I wish, someone has told this to the director of this movie... I hate it!!!
