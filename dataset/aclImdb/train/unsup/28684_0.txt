As Good As It Gets is definitely one of the best movies I've seen. This movie depends entirely on it's script and the performance of it's actors, and both were excellent. <br /><br />If there are people out there who doubt Jack Nicholson acting capabilities, I'd advise them to see this film. The way in which he portrays his character, a lonely and on the surface mean man suffering from OCD is just brilliant. The character was so real, and I really grew to like him during the movie. <br /><br />And then there's Helen Hunt, I don't care what other people say, she is a great actress and people who say she's not feminine are just plain crazy. I do not think she's the beautiful, but when you watch this movie, how can you not fall in love with her character? To me that is the proof she's is a great actress.<br /><br />And then there is Greg Kinnear, who also does a great job. This movie is just full of great performances.<br /><br />The story is funny, dramatic and romantic, it's got it all. The characters are so well written that they feel real, and I like them so much, that I wish they were. The dialogues are great and there is a lot I will not soon forget. <br /><br />***** Spoiler (start)***** Melvin Udall: Where do they teach you to talk like this? In some Panama City "Sailor wanna hump-hump" bar, or is it getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey? Sell crazy someplace else. We're all stocked up here.<br /><br />There are so many great scenes; Melvin and his interaction with the dog, and when he realizes he has stepped over the line by talking about carol's son. I also like his relationship with Simon, you can see him wrestling with the fact that he actually likes him. ***** Spoiler (finish)*****<br /><br />I'd advise this movie to every serious movie fan. For in my opinion; This movie is As Good As Movies Get<br /><br />
