Patrick Stewart had a bit part in this movie, and Liam Neeson played Sir Gawain. I wondered while I was watching it if either of them ever regretted being in such a bad movie. Besides the acting, one of the worst things about this one was that all of the knights wore headbands (as if we didn't know it was made in the eighties), and were always wearing full plate armor! If they had also worn spandex, the headbands would have been understandable, but wearing the armor all day, every day as opposed to normal clothing, was a bit trying on a person's common sense.<br /><br />It was pretty ridiculous from a factual and realistic point-of-view, and pretty much worth missing.
