It is a very spooky feeling to see a film based on someone you knew in real life. I honestly do not know how much artistic liberty was taken with this film as I did not know his family, but I knew Rocky Dennis as a teenager and Eric Stoltz did an absolutely fantastic job of capturing his heart and soul as well as his intelligence. I am grateful that such a remarkable person will be remembered for who he truly was.
