One of the most popular formulas used for scaring people is that of an evil house. Whether you're a believer or not, the supernatural can be a fascinating subject and perfect material for a good Horror film. Over the decades this particular type of Horror film has evolved, from classics like 'The Haunting,' which eschews the use of big effects for suspense and subtle scares to more recent hits like 'Poltergeist,' which does a great of mixing style and substance, still being very scary. Just about every country has produced a movie set in a haunted location, and no country does it the same way as any other. Italy is known for some for some very surreal and even whacked out Horror films that have found success abroad. They are far less conventional than many American Horror films, which is part of what makes them so darn interesting.<br /><br />Pros: A great location, perfect for a haunted dwelling. A simple, but effectively eerie score. Some of the performances are decent. Moves at a pretty good pace, especially in the second half. A few good and very blood kills. A few nice effects. Some really creepy sequences and images. So bizarre and twisted that it has this great dreamlike quality.<br /><br />Cons: Nearly plot less. Some wooden performances. Has many plot holes and lapses in logic. Some of the effects are shoddy. Too many characters and none are developed enough for us to get invested in them.<br /><br />Final thoughts: You'll be apologizing to your brain afterward, but if you have a liking for Italian Horror then you'll likely enjoy the ride anyway. Most Italian Horror films lack logic, but like 'The House By the Cemetery,' a film this could seen as a loose sequel to since it uses the same location, 'Ghosthouse' is even more out there and nonsensical than usual. Doesn't change the fact that it's a fun and trippy flick.<br /><br />My rating: 3.5/5
