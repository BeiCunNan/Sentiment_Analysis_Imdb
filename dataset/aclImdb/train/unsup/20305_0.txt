In my opinion this is their second best live show surpassed only by Hooligan's Island. To sum up the plot, this line from the show says it all: "Stop turning everything dirty, will you, I'm trying to f**k the Queen!" - yes, that's the plot :D The first half of the show is great fun (God save the Quim, Eddie?) but it's the second half that really gets me in tears from laughter. Among other things you will in this half experience Ade getting kicked (for real) in the b******s by Rik (poor guy) which I must admit I giggle about every time. And the later scene with their girlfriends (well ... blow-up dolls, actually) gets me laughing just thinking about it. So if you in any shape or form are into vulgar humor, cricket bat violence and blow-up doll action, this is a show for you. Watch it now! 9/10
