I remember seeing "J.T." when it was originally shown on CBS Saturday, December 13, 1969 (I was then 7 years old); I kept hearing about the show when promos were run during my favorite CBS Saturday morning shows, so I decided to see what all the hype was about. What a nice story it was! (Back in those days it seemed CBS made the best high-quality holiday specials, and "J.T." was no exception.)<br /><br />I also remember later that same day my father (may he rest in peace) took us to a Christmas tree lot in Port Huron, Michigan, where we cut a live tree and took it home to where we lived in Warren. Thus, another nice childhood memory was encoded in this.<br /><br />In the spring (!) of 1977, I attended Lansing Catholic Central High School in Lansing, Michigan, and had a treat in seeing "J.T." during Religion class (they obtained a 16mm film of the show from Carousel Films, Inc. in New York City; back then, VCRs were still in their infancy).<br /><br />CBS reran "J.T." in December 1980 and after that hadn't rerun it again until Thanksgiving Day, 1987; at that time, my family had their first VCR, and I was very lucky to have videotaped the show. Unfortunately, some parts of the tape had "dropouts" on it. Then, four years later, CBS reran "J.T." for the very last time, on Christmas Day, 1991. I figured that would have been the final rerun, so I was smart to have re-taped the show, and on a better quality videocassette. So I had that tape of "J.T." for the next decade until I discovered in late 2001 that Carousel Film and Video (as they now call themselves) still owned the video rights to "J.T." They told me the tape sold for $59.99; as with another writer, Carousel told me "J.T." was mostly available for educational use, but sold it to me after I explained to them I couldn't locate a commercially produced copy of the tape and that it would be for my own personal use. It was a very wise investment - the copy of "J.T." Carousel sent me was unedited (there were two scenes CBS chopped out in order to fit the time slot when they last ran it involving Helen Martin, Pearl on "227," as a neighbor in the building where J.T. lived who complained about him playing the radio loudly), was hi-fi encoded, and best of all, had NO commercial interruptions!<br /><br />And who would have thought back in 1969 that Kevin Hooks would not only go on to become a major actor but a director as well (Hooks recently directed "Fled" and "Black Dog"), and that Ja'net Du Bois, Theresa Merritt, and Holland Taylor would go on to major stardom? (Ja'net DuBois went on to play Willona Woods on "Good Times," Theresa Merritt starred with Clifton Davis in "That's My Mama" and starred on Broadway in "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" shortly before she passed away in late 2001, and Holland Taylor recently appeared in several TV movies.) And thanks to the other writer who clarified this - I wondered if that was the same Jane Wagner (who wrote the script for "J.T.") who became Lily Tomlin's writing partner. Turns out she was.<br /><br />So I would encourage anyone who wishes to get "J.T." contact Carousel Film and Video in New York; it's certainly worth the steep price if you want to see this special again in its original, uncut form. Besides, who knows if and when CBS will ever rerun "J.T." again?<br /><br />And Carousel Film and Video, if anyone on your staff is reading this I hope you'll PLEASE see about putting "J.T." on DVD very soon. A great special like this deserves to be digitally remastered for a new generation!
