Of all the bile-inducing vomitoriums to squeeze out of Tinseltown's bloody sphincter over the past 50 years, this is indisputably the worst of the lot. Carvey's one-man show is such a poor excuse for comedy that it doesn't even deserve to get raked by the MST 3000 crew. I swear, I actually felt nauseated after watching this festering pile of manure. In order to lengthen the lame 70-minute running time, the producers padded the end credits to TEN minutes with lame-ass Carvey impressions that surely couldn't even make the last few minutes of that God-awful Saturday Night Live TV show. In it you can see Carvey imitating other notable actors who surely don't deserve the indignity. Did I mention it features Jessica Simpson in a cameo? Yech!! If you ever plan on watching this stinking puke-fest, you might want to make sure you have plenty of Pepto-Bisthmol beforehand.
