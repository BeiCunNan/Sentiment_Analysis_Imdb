I was nine when I saw this movie and fell in love with a then very young Kevin Bacon. Who stars as the lead Ren MacCormack, a Chicago teen who comes to Beaumont where drugs, alcohol, and dancing have been banned and his now divorced mother trying to find a job. Ren doesn't fit in with the "wierdos" of the town except he finds a friend in Willard played by the very missed Chris Penn, who was skinny at the time. A very young and unknown Sarah Jessica Parker and then Fame star Lori Singer stars in the movie. Singer plays Ariel, the rebellous preacher's daughter and her boyfriend is a jerk of a bully. As she wants to escape the town as she tells Ren, she even applied to colleges that her dad doesn't know about either. Great movie but predictable. Kick off those Sunday shoes indeed!!
