I've seen a good variety of Korean movies but this ranks among the worst I've seen. The story (without spoilers)...4 young Korean guys rob a local gas station for fun. Some time afterwards the guys get bored and decide to rob the same station a second time. This time around the owner has hidden the money, so the gang decide to capture the staff and work at the station to get money.<br /><br />And so the comedy ensues. Or not. The four central characters somehow all manage to act badly and be annoying throughout the movie. Seong-jin Kang is incessantly flicking his hair around and stomping around. Sung-jae Lee is pouting moodily or chewing on invisible gum. Oh-seong Yu has at least half an hours screen time where he does nothing but shout at the characters to kneel with their heads on the floors. Ji-tae Yu is unconvincing as 'Paint'.<br /><br />The inherent pointlessness & stupidity of the storyline makes the movie completely un-enjoyable. Why does the station not have any alarms, video cameras or security? Why do the hostages not put up any resistance against the criminals? Why is the music so embarrassingly 80's when this film is made in the late 90's?<br /><br />Attack The Gas Station reminds me vaguely of 'Airheads', which may or may not be a compliment. If you've contributed to this movie's 7.1 IMDb rating you really should be ashamed of yourself. Let's recommend good movies for fellow IMDb users.
