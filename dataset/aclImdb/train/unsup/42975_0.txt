MONK is just about the WORST DETECTIVE SERIES THAT HAS BEEN AIRED ON UK TV. I don't know why the viewers in the USA rave about this rubbish. It is about as riveting and exciting as finding that someone has emptied a trash can on your doorstep the first thing in the morning. Thank goodness that it is only aired on the Hallmark channel in the UK. To watch this and get into raptures about it is beyond me. When you think of all the great series that have reached these shores from the USA, it is an insult to the American people to think that they can actually enjoy this rubbish, and can't actually wait until the next episode is aired. I just cannot see how Tony Shaloub can keep you riveted to your screens. I cant think of one movie where I have thought, oh great, Tony Shaloub is in this movie. I cant wait for the day when Monk is no longer aired on UK TV. His charismatic presence is zero. The only way that this series is in the least watchable, is if he was not in it.
