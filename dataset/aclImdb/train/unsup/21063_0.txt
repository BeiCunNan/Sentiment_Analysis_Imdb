I completely agreed with the last comment that this was the worst movie depiction of Jesus ever. Unlike others, I did not appreciate Jesus smiling throughout the movie,,and was unable to take him seriously. I don't consider myself an expert in acting, but the actor playing Jesus was one of the worst. Its amazing to me too how many commented how closely it followed the Gospel of Matthew,,,,,yet it left out quite a bit and actually mixed up, for one reason or another the sequence of events. I have just seen the Gospel of John,,,,,,and would highly recommend it as following the whole Gospel account and being much better acted. Also the older Jesus film released by Campus Crusade in 1979 and based on Luke was much better too.
