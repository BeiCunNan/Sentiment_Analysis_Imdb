This post may contain spoilers.<br /><br />Well, okay that's not really saying that much considering this "horror" series from Japan is not even close to being a "head" above anything else. I don't quite get the whole "forbidden fruit" thing... but at least it was over really quickly.<br /><br />There are a few scenes that are very nice and romantic between the Tomie characters that may be worth a look. Mmm, Tomie's dad is probably thinking Tomie Love Sandwich! And who doesn't like Tomie's head in a handbag? Especially when it's kind of more like a torso with odd appendages.<br /><br />Basically it's crap and you know it so just enjoy that for what it is worth.<br /><br />Tomie will never die and, yes, it will hurt.<br /><br />Tomie grade: F+
