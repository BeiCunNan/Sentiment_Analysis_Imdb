I guess I'm a Mira Nair fan. I saw her Mississippi Masala (1992) and thought it was a great success. I believed her to be an ethnic director, dealing with Indian matters. I was wrong. The girls of Bayonne, NJ are authentic to their nails and accents. Uma Thurman gives it up, not the glamour girl we're used too, but a thirty something bar fly unable to land a man. It's not that she's unattractive, this is Uma we're talking about, but she is socially retarded because her daddy ran out on the family. Consequently, she hits all the wrong notes in interaction with the local Jersey Guys. The stress has caused symptoms, hysterical blindness, as her tone-deaf social antics at the local nightspot resemble the antics of immature high school girls. Her friend, beautifully played by Juliette Lewis is just a little bit smarter, but not much. They dream about being really hot when they were sixteen. Lewis' grade school daughter, April Autumn is crying out for a responsible mother. Meanwhile, Ben Gazarra, still suave after all these years, is romancing Uma's mom, Gina Rowlands. This is a slice of life movie. The pill freed women back in the 50's, but one wonders if it did them any good.
