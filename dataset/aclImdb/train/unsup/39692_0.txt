I remember liking this film as a child, so at least on that level Thumbelina is a success for it is a film aimed for the children, but whilst many Disney films can still hold some of their magic for the older audiences, that is where Thumbelina falls down for once the viewer reaches the age where they become critical, then this film will give them much to be negatively critical about.<br /><br />I'd like to say that, visually at least, the film is just as stunning as anything I've seen Disney create. And even the story was enjoyable to watch. However, there were plot holes, the music never sounded original (even the main song 'Let Me Be Your Wings' sounded and looked like a rip off of Aladdin's 'A Whole New World'), and the passing of time was never clear, so you were never sure whether a couple minutes had passed or several months. The script was nothing special either, with very few laughs or witty comments, and all the characters felt like regurgitation's of previous characters, cartoon or not.<br /><br />It is a sweet film, and I'll always be glad I watched it as a kid. I do regret however watching again now, many years later, and finally seeing the truth of what this film really is. I would have much rather be left with the magic.
