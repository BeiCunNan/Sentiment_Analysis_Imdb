The Undead is a very silly piece of melodrama from Roger Corman. The plot is concerned with a time travelling doctor who regresses his street walking patient back to a time of witches, imps, dumb knights, fey fights, and singing gravediggers. Listening to Smolkin belt out his rhymes is funny. Watching this strange film on MST is even better. They point out things like how come Pendergon trusts everyone right off the bat? They also point out that Quintis has become rather smug toward the end of the movie. If you think that you can't survive this movie, I've just got one word for you, STAY!!!!! At least if you're watching this on MST.
