"I fight! I love! I conquer like a Barbarian!" Sound like something Yul Brynner might say? Nope, it's just the Duke, wearing a scraggly Fu Manchu mustache and seemingly painful eye appliances for that Oriental look. Yes, pilgrim, get out of town when the Conqueror rides across the steppes of.....Utah? This film is so ludicrous that you will howl with laughter. <br /><br />And the Duke isn't the only object of derision. Susan Hayward of the flaming hair and milky skin as the princess who is the object of his desire couldn't be more wrong in that role. You expect her to whip out a cigarette and give forth with some snappy dialogue. Dialogue???.....did people ever really speak that way? Somehow I think not. I'm surprised MST3K never did this film but maybe it's funnier without added comment.<br /><br />I cannot imagine what the director Dick Powell was thinking? This was a man who made some wise decisions in his long career; unfortunately this was not one of them. Maybe the answer lies in the fact that Howard Hughes who was not noted for his wise decisions was the head of RKO at the time.<br /><br />The down side of this film is the fact that the majority of those involved were all stricken with cancer possibly as a result of filming in an atomic/hydrogen bomb testing ground. Whose decision was that?
