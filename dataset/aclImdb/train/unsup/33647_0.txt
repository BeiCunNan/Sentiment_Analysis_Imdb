About the only people who will have any appreciation for this movie are homesick Vermonters...I grew up riding my bike on the same roads as Adam, so it was a hoot to see Marshfield & Barre from back in the day. It was even better to hear the gold-domed State Capitol Building described as a "court house." Don't bother renting this film- it's truly awful. And the ending sucks. I don't understand why it was ever released on DVD...maybe it was an attempt to capitalize on the study hall market- bored kids watching the movie because they can't be bothered to crack open the book...Why on earth Robert Wagner chose to get involved with such a lame project is beyond me...
