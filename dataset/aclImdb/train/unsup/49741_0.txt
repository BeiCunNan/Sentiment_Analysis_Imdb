I usually don't give 1 or 2:s to movie because there is always something in a movie thats good, This movie however has nothing good in it. Everything with this movie is horrible, the story, the music, the acting, the jokes(what jokes?) And to top it all the actors don't even know the English language. I really don't get it. Swedes are among the best of the non-English speaking people at English, so why pick people that are as good as a bunch of kindergarden-children. It really sounds terrible, and it also makes the rest of the world think that all swedes suck at English which really isn't the case.<br /><br />I really like watching bad movies because i can laugh at them, But this isn't even funny, in any way. I know it tries to be funny, but fails miserably. like someone already posted, "its not even so bad its good, its just so bad its unbearable" I can safely say that this is the worst movie i have ever seen.<br /><br />AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!! PS: Bunnyman???!?!! What were they thinking? DS
