this is a great movie and i think it will be considered a classic the thing that pisses me off is that Marris isn't in the Hall of fame most people who don't know much about him think he only had that one good year when he broke the record but he was the MVP of the 1960 season and he played well throughout most of his career he should be in the hall of fame without a doubt there's four people that aren't in the hall of fame that should be shoeless Joe Jackson isn't there because he threw the world series even though he played excellent and Pete rose should be in there to it doesn't matter what he did off the field its what he did on the field that counts Marris is the next person not in i already explained why but the most shocking person not to be in the hall of fame is frank Robinson what the hell happened there
