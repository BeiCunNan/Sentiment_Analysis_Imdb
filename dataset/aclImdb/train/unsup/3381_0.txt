I was expecting a lot more out of this movie, but it didn't provide. I hope Rain Wilson would be a funny character, the sort of one he play in the office. instead he plays a more serious role which he just does not suit. Chris O' neill and Rhiannon Wryn do unspectacular jobs as the children in this movie. The story is lifeless and i couldn't quite follow what was going on. I could see why little children mite enjoy this movie as it is largely about a toy bear, but otherwise i advise you not to! I thought maybe they could have had the parents playing a 'comedy' role, but instead they were very serious. the cast suited the movie. They were both terrible
