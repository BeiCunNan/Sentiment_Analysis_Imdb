My Blue Heaven is a wonderful example of Steve Martin's diversity as a comedic actor. I love his devil-may-care attitude in this one and his relationship with Rick Moranis's character's is absolutely hilarious.<br /><br />Martin plays Vincent 'Vinnie' Antonelli, a low-level mob figure who is turning state's evidence against a bigger gangland figure. He is in the witness protection program, and assigned to Barney Coopersmith (Rick Moranis), an FBI agent who is chomping at the bit to do some "real detective work."<br /><br />I won't go into the plot, but it is quite enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />One of my favorite Steve Martin movies.<br /><br />It rates a 7.2/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
