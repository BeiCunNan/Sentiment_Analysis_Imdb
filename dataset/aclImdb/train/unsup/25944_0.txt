It seems as though pride and responsibility have left director Ross McElwee long before his journey to find Sherman. If he would have stuck to the assignment and not been so self deprecating he may have had some successes in his documentary and maybe even some in his life and we viewers might have actually learned something. Instead he only succeeds in being a creepy stalker schooling himself in unhealthy, regressive isolationism and cowardly fear of nuclear holocaust. These qualities are equally reflective in his failed personal relationships that leave him to snuggle-up with ticks and mosquitoes in a tree house. The most we get from the movie is the satisfaction that we are not Ross and that we have a bed indoors.
