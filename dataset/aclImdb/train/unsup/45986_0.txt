One of the worst movies I've ever seen.Fito Paez is a great musician, creator of many great songs. But his first movie, "Vidas Privadas" is a study is bad directing, bad editing, awful score, bad acting, horrible lines (out of a soap opera), novice photography and especially bad narrative.<br /><br />One of those movies, that you know what is going to happen even before you enter the cinema. Cecilia Roth (his then wife) and Mexican actor Gael García Bernal are good actors, but they are unable to generate any emotions, because the elliptical unsastianl plot is a mix of genres and clichés.<br /><br />If you are interested in movies with the same theme, I recommend "Kamchatcka" or "The official Story" two great movies.
