I'd seen this on cable many years ago, and watched it on hulu.com this afternoon. It's really a good little piece of work.<br /><br />There's nothing new in the story. A bored, restless young woman in a dead end job in a small town hooks up with a smooth talking young man. Before she realizes it she, her friend, and her sister and the sister's boyfriend are all in over their heads because the men are obsessed with the wild west fantasy and see themselves as gunslingers. Everyone is firing real bullets, though, and soon it's not any fun.<br /><br />The work has a ton of antecedents. BONNIE AND CLYDE, obviously. Dozens of Warner Brothers movies from the 1930's and 1940's. Goddard's New Wave film BREATHLESS. And, more than anything else, Jack Kerouac's novel ON THE ROAD.<br /><br />These people spend the bulk of their time in vehicles, rushing toward and/or away from something. Thankfully, the film's producers didn't have the money to build elaborate sets so they filmed in dusty little towns in New Mexico, using actual locations and probably hiring local actors, too.<br /><br />And Lynda Carter. Good Lord, what a beauty. No wonder she was cast to play AVA GARDNER in a filmed biography. Those eyes...and she has nude scenes one, too: now that she's about to turn sixty, I'd love to see her reaction watching this one again.<br /><br />A young lady named Belinda Balanski plays her friend, and she's also a beauty, also a fine young actress, and also topless. She never became a big star but is a favorite of director Joe Dante (THE HOWLING, GREMLINS) so she's worked steadily over the years. Still, she never achieved her potential. Pity.<br /><br />Lots of solid character actors fill out the smaller roles. And, it being the seventies there's some amazing facial hair sported by the male supporting cast.<br /><br />Check this one out. You might be surprised how much you enjoy it.
