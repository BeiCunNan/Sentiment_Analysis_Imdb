A really bad movie. I never cracked a smile. I very rarely give a film a rating below 5, (gave this one a 3) not because there are no bad movies, it's just that I don't watch films that I think are going to be bad. I taped this one just because it had Justine Bateman in it, and I had liked some of her stuff on TV. She wasn't bad here, she just had nothing to work with. This one was painful to watch. I wasted 90 minutes, and the cast and crew wasted 6 days. Grade: F
