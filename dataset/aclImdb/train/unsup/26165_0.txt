Soul Survivor (listed as Spectres on IMDb) is a little different than a lot of movies I see on Lifetime Movie Network. This is a tale of a teenage girl, Kelly (Lauren Birkell), who is lonely and depressed, as her father has passed away and her mother, Laura Lee (Marina Sirtis), is too self-involved. After Kelly attempts suicide, Laura Lee takes her to live in a home in the country for the summer. Before even settling in, Kelly meets a mysterious boy and she begins to experience unusual happenings in the house.<br /><br />I liked this movie but I had to pay close attention, as it seemed a little choppy in places and it had a lot going on. Lauren Birkell does a nice job, as does Alexis Cruz. Marina Sirtis' character is annoying but I suppose she is supposed to be that way for the story. She does give a realistic portrayal, though.
