I did not like this movie at all. I am not much of a cheerleading fan. Also this movie lacked a very good storyline. I guess it kind of described what high school drama is, in a way. The only thing that saved this movie from getting like a 2 in my book is that Kirsten Dunst and her cheerleader friends are very attractive.
