On a dark and stormy night in Yeehaw Georgia, a powerful electrical storm downs the power lines, and the electricity floods the muddy ground, awakening the vast population of worms! Unfortunately, the electricity doesn't turn the worms into Giant Worms, or mutant worms, it just makes them kind of cranky. <br /><br />Enter Mick, a wimpy antique enthusiast who has come to Georgia on vacation to visit his Southern Belle girlfriend Jerri, a scrawny redhead with an outrageous Scarlet O'Hara accent. Jerri lives with her whacked out mother and her odd looking sister, and is stalked by the local worm salesman's son Roger, a big dumb guy with an IQ of a cucumber. Mick's vacation turns out to be anything but restful, as he encounters a worm in a chocolate soda, a skeleton on the ground and a creepy sheriff with frightening teeth and gravity defying hair. By the time he and Jerri realize what is happening in the small town of Fly Creek, it is too late. The worms flood the streets and houses like an angry swarm of spaghetti, consuming any and all who stand in their way. Will anyone survive the night?<br /><br />I've never been able to figure out if this was supposed to be a black comedy or if we're supposed to take the worm threat seriously. Either way, the only thing this film did for me was to make me feel incredibly filthy. Filmed on location in Georgia, this film was also too convincing in it's portrayal of the rural south: I kept waiting for the banjo music to start up, kept waiting for Roger or the sheriff to ask Mick to "squeal like a pig." I couldn't feel sorry for the people who ended up as worm food because they were all so icky. I didn't care if young lovers Mick and Jerri lived to see another day - they're both so wimpy and whiny you won't care much either. The only character I actually enjoyed was Alma, Jerri's kid Amazon sister with her smart ass attitude and weird clothes. Other than that, I spent the majority of the film cheering on the worms.
