"All murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets."<br /><br />-Voltaire<br /><br />"Traitor" is another movie in the line of Iraq war movies. And while this film does not directly deal in the actual war, it does deal in the war against terror, which I am pretty sure are the same.<br /><br />Reminding me immensely of last year's "The Kingdom", "Traitor" follows the story of a Muslim man, Samir (Don Cheadle) who is actually a deep cover operative for a branch of the US government.<br /><br />How does this remind me of "The Kingdom" you ask, well if you have seen that movie you know that it casts a sympathetic light on the otherwise slandered name of the Muslim. Both of these films show that not all Muslims want to blow Americans up.<br /><br />Samir is a deeply religious man, who wants only to serve God, after being caught while trying to sell detonators to, who we can only call Terrorists, he is sent to prison. Now before I get to ahead of myself I have to let you know that the story gets sort of confusing at times, at least for me.<br /><br />For instance I am not sure why, out of all of the people there, the FBI chooses to interrogate Samir, but maybe I just wasn't paying enough attention.<br /><br />Without revealing too much I will just say that Samir escapes and gets caught up with a radical terrorist group that tests both his faith in God and in man in general. And of course the FBI is after him at every turn.<br /><br />The FBI are Guy Pierce and Neal McDonough ,who to their credit do a very nice job, although it was a just a little too "Good cop, Bad cop" for the entire film. Perhaps my favorite character has to be Jeff Daniels who plays Samir's US contact. But that is just because I am a huge fan of his.<br /><br />In summation this is a great thriller, if you can wrap your mind around the plot, with great acting. Unfortunately I do not foresee any Box Office records being broken, or Oscars being won, but if you are in the mood for a good ride then I would recommend "Traitor"
