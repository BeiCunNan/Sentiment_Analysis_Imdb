I did not figure out how Crawford hid the missing evidence until the last scene of the theatrical ending. Now, I don't like obvious foreshadowing in films, like when the camera dwells far too long on the item you're supposed to take notice of. However, I would have appreciated a *little* clue, even if it didn't represent itself as a clue. The flashback montage provided during the explanation contained scenes that were not even actual scenes from the film. The alternate ending where Beachum compares the photographs is easier to buy, but the theatrical ending depicts Beachum as pure genius. I agree, the love scene was ridiculous. I thought Nikki would have been more evil...I mean, what kind of boss sleeps with their employees? Oh yeah, the skanky kind. Anyway, Gosling's facial expressions were PERFECT throughout: The "Yeah, so what?" or "Oh crap!" looks were awesome.
