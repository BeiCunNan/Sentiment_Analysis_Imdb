The reviews are pretty bad. <br /><br />The positive reviews are all written by people who have NEVER<br /><br />reviewed any other movie (that is never ever a good sign) yet it has a high score? It's called creating fake accounts in order to not lose face when shopping around for financing.<br /><br />I gotta believe that someone is jucing the scores. 25% of voters gave it a 9 or higher. Those are scores that are better or equal to the best movies ever created by man. ~ 62% gave it a 7 or higher which would put it near the top 250 "best" movies on imdb. yet of reviews there only 10% positive on the commentary board. please. it was bad<br /><br />when i saw it in the theater 2 years ago, it is bad now.<br /><br />
