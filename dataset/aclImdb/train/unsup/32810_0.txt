This was one of the lousiest 1.5 hours of my life. Nora is a stupid and annoying woman who is also desperate, immature and boring. Her character made me cringe-- why was she so monotone and emotionless? Oh except for her anxiety attacks... yeah, whatever. and why does her being 30 make her feel SO OLD? shes so stupid. She needs a male blow up doll.<br /><br />If she whined any more about how she just wanted to feel loved by a "good guy", I would've puked.<br /><br />Not to mention, she's a drunk. She's drinking in every part of the movie. it's like she cant go through 24 hours without having at least one glass of alcohol.<br /><br />And every 2 minutes of the movie, there's Someone with a drink in their hand.<br /><br />The movie is annoying, unforgivable and seems unfinished. I hated this movie with a passion. Really a waste of time.<br /><br />Stupidest story line ever.
