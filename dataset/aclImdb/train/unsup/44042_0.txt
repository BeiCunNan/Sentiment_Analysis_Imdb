The Plot A troubled teen has the habit of sucking his thumb. His orthodontist puts him under hypnosis and he soon gets rid of the habit. After being diagnosed with ADHD, he begins to take Ritalin. But the Ritalin changes him completely from a quiet nerd that nobody had time for, to a loud-mouthed brat who suddenly became the confident head of the debate team. The film raises the question of whether to medicate your children, which is a very topical issue today.<br /><br />The Pros This film could have been better. It suffers from bad film-making, which causes it to be boring. The only pro is the cast and the acting.<br /><br />The Cons Thumbsucker takes too long to get its point across, which for me ultimately was not much of a point at all. There was not enough conflict and drama to satisfy an audience. The woman next to me slept through the entire film and by the time it finished, I could not help thinking she had the right idea. .<br /><br />Final Word This film is too slow and plain uninteresting. There are so many better films out at the moment for you to see. Leave this off your list. Thumbsucker gets two thumbs down.
