This is a mediocre film about fairies. While the history and nostalgia about fairies is, perhaps, somewhat interesting, there is never any rational argument used to justify their existence. Basically this is a fluffy representation of fairies whose only proof is a variety of photogenic sceneries and not so photogenic nutbars who are obviously deluding themselves. No reasonable person could honestly watch this and conclude anything but it was barking mad. Just because their are interesting hills and trees does not mean fairies exist. Shame on this filmmaker. Perhaps next time he will interview at least one skeptic or scientist who has an education beyond 3rd grade.
