I wasn't expecting much from this after a majority of reviewers thought poorly of it, though I was pleasantly surprised. Long Time Dead isn't without fault though, I found parts clunky and badly written. Also, they relied too heavily on scenes where the victim is trying to avoid being seized and they eventually become slightly tiresome as a result.<br /><br />However, I think this is on par with the likes of I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream, and does live up to it's reputation of making "Jeepers Creepers look like The Tweenies". The poor reviews are likely to be down to it's release date, and the lack of originality - though I wouldn't worry about that too much. I recommend this to all fans of the horror genre, otherwise wait until television.
