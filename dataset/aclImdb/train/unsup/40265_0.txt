I watch a lot of indie horror films especially the ones that are released by lions gate films and I am disappointed a lot of times too by the low budget and predictable story. This one didn't have a predictable story entirely but it did drag out for the first hour and it failed to have enough excitement to wake me back up towards the final 42 minutes. I have seen much worse from lions gate, but then again I have seen much better. I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone because it really bored me a lot and the ending was really cheesy. I mean I didn't see it coming or anything but it was still stupid and the acting isn't very good in the film either but I don't look at that as much if its a good story but this movie was just a plain old sleeper compared to the awesome horror films I have seen in the past.<br /><br />So anyways this movie isn't worth your 3 dollars to rent it and surprisingly its not made by Ulli Lommel. In case no one knows him thats reading this, he is a complete idiot that wouldn't know directing if it smacked him in the face. Anyways I give this movie a 3 out of 10.
