Hilarious RKO comedy of 1940 with impeccable credits both cast and writing/directing and crew. With editing by Robert Wise! What a combo! Obviously a smash hit in its day and must have a wonderful experience to see in the 3000 seat movie palace. Screened a lot on TV in Australia, anyone lucky enough to roar with laughter at this almost perfect screwball comedy will instantly agree how hilarious and exact it is. In the 60s, it was ineptly remade as a Doris Day vehicle also successful and equally well crafted but not nearly as much fun. Somehow it works better as an art deco comedy. The courtroom scenes are almost lifted verbatim into WHAT'S UP DOC in the 70s. Interesting and sad too, to see the very talented child actor Scotty Beckett long before his untimely descent into crime and early death. The obvious rapport between housepals Grant and Randolph Scott is slyly enjoyable too. This is champagne Hollywood. Imagine a hideous remake today for the multiplex mob: Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore instead of Cary Grant and Irene Dunne... with Rob Schneider in the Randolph Scott role. Add swearing and punching and edit using a lawnmower.
