My brother and I watched the first 15 minutes of this movie and both decided it was boring and we were getting nothing out of the movie, yet we decided to give it a while longer to see if it got any better. 20 more minutes went by and still - nothing too interesting. The only relatively interesting scene was when Hope and her boyfriend hook up. Then about 5 minutes later she makes out with a girl on who's experiencing her first trip on ecstasy for about 5 more minutes. Then you basically find out after reading the reviews on here that the movie is not what you expected it to be. The back of the DVD package makes it sound like Hope is supposed to go crazy and have hallucinations and things of that nature, but it's really about drugs. She's battling an addiction of her boyfriend and her boyfriend's battling his own addiction with drugs. Overall, it's the biggest waste of time ever.
