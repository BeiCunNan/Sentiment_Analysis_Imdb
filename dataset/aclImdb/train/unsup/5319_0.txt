I really love those British movies. Unlike most American movies, the people aren't all models who've just done a nosejob or two but ordinary people with just as many shortages as you and I. The story shows the life of some families living in the same governmentapartment building. All poor people who need to do stupid jobs to earn just enough to keep alive. And just when it seems that life sucks bad forever, everyone realizes who they love and what they live for when they almost lose one of their own. Great movies seldom have brilliant stories, but just like this one the beauty is within the characters, hitting you as if they were real people, living next door to you. Well, to me anyway.
