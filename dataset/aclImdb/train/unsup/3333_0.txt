Despite having an air of doubt over this film after reading that the director Uwe Boll was given a Razzie award for worst director I decided to watch it. I am glad I did. This film portrays the problems the US army faced with the Kamikaze Vietnamese soldiers.<br /><br />The Army's job is to flush out the tunnels and render them useless, but little do they know that the tunnels they are in are actually above where they need to be. The Vietnamese suicide squad does its best to stop all this from happening.<br /><br />This film has blood, action, fighting, explosions and a hint of gore. The screen play is top notch and I think the director does not deserve the Razzie, he did a fantastic job. The actors are little known but still I recommend watching.<br /><br />My rating 8/10
