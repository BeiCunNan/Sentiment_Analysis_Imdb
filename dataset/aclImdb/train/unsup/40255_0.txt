There basically wasn't any plot - just two major f-ups riding around in a car doing what major f-ups do. Absolutely no character development - you never understand how these two got to be friends in the first place, let alone stayed friends. Also a complete miscast. Was Bale supposed to be Hispanic or what? It was like watching Richard Burton playing Snoop Dogg. I know English actors are versatile, but there are some roles they should stay away from. Playing a war veteran from south-central LA is one of them. It just didn't work for me.<br /><br />The only thing the movie had going for it (and I suppose why many people liked it) was a lot of over-the-top violence that left you constantly anticipating what laws they were going to trash next. Which after a while became quite boring, once you realize that's the only point to the movie. And how did they get away with openly breaking countless laws - when most people could never get away with it? It seems that they have friends in the LAPD whose ultimate goal in life is to party down with two unemployed losers. I know - it was an insult to my intelligence too.<br /><br />Finally, the "he might have been a nice guy if he hadn't been traumatized in Afghanistan" alibi has been done waaaay too many times, and wasn't at all convincing in this instance. I got the feeling that Bale's character would have been an sociopath in any case - though probably not as suicidal. In that sense, I was totally OK with the fact that he got f-up in the war. Otherwise, he might have hurt a lot more people, and they wouldn't have all been scumbags like himself.
