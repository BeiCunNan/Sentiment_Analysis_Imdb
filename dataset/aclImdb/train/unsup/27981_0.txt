This movie shows us how difficult life can be in our poor Latin America (and in my country MÃ©xico). The story is told in an excellent way by Jorge Fons, giving us different points of view at the same time. I know that not many people is interested in movies from any other country than the USA, but this one is really worth seeing. Ernesto Gomez Cruz deserves a mention apart for his work as "Don Ru", he proves us once again what a good actor he is.
