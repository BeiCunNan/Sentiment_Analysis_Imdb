I saw this movie last night on Lifetime movies and it is getting ready to come on again in a hour or so. The movie kind of reminded me of my crush I had on a coach, although I was in college and nothing like that happened. I can honestly feel the frustrations on the "feelings" she had and even his. Although it was all together wrong. I am married to an older man, but I was already in my late 20s when it started. One thing if this guy was "in love" with her, he should of divorced his wife and waited until she was of age. However he was just sick minded and wanted a young piece and needed help. He should of backed away when she said she wanted it over. He, being an adult and a teacher should of been the mature one and not let this crush get to him. Crushes happen all the time with students towards their teachers. I had crushes on teachers in Jr. High (and then later to a coach but like I said, in college), but thank God none of them took advantage of me like that. Teachers and coaches and other adults should expect this, and know where the line is drawn. Great movie and the actors did a great job!
