A few days ago, I went to the theater to watch this movie that somehow got my attention.<br /><br />This movies focuses on the story of Zoe (Mori). A woman whose marriage is in constant conflict. Her husband Ignacio (Meier) inheritor of the family business, and Gonzalo (Cardona) Ingnacio's younger brother who gives his life to painting, but makes a living thanks to his brother and strangely always shows hatred towards him. With all these background, it isn't hard to presume where the story is leading to.<br /><br />As the story goes on, more background details explains why every character acts the way they do, and how a triangle of betrayal and disloyalties is taking part in the plot.<br /><br />Acting: I think Cardona (Gonzalo) though not outstanding, is the only one who achieves a little touch of truthfulness to his character, showing himself as someone careless and incapable of commitment. Meier (Ignacio), He got his moments of clarity, but not enough to convince with his character. Mori (Zoe), I must say that it's the first time I see her acting, and to be honest, I think that she never managed Zoe, being absolutely lacking of the emotiveness required by her character. It's supposed that Zoe is a woman full of inner conflicts as a result of the relationship with her husband. Though, she never get to make the audience feel any empathy. I should say that being a beautiful woman is never enough.<br /><br />Plot: It always kept predictable, that's why I expected any surprise near the end, but it never happened. Sometimes it might bores you or find that something doesn't fit.<br /><br />Directing: Not outstanding, it has some highlights. For instance, the manage of close-up within conversations between character, where you can see that everything blurs but the faces.<br /><br />Soundtrack: Apparently doesn't have one, you just can hear the song "Mentiras" from the Chilean band "La Ley"<br /><br />In summary, I wouldn't recommend it. But if you want to give it a try, do it at your own risk.
