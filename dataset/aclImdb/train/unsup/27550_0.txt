Critiquing a series after only seeing the pilot? I have been watching the series since the beginning, seeing the 5th episode yesterday. While I agree it is a low budget series, it is somewhat intriguing for someone who knows something about the history of the main characters in the story. While there are some changes in the original storyline, the changes were not as drastic as the changes in "Smallville" regarding how Superman grew up in the little Kansas town. As for the cast, I agree that I expected Ming to be older and have a more vicious look, but then Ma and Pa Kent were pretty old already by the time the found the little alien baby. Therefor, I suspect that the market group they are trying to find is closer the those in their late teens and early 20s and they are casting for that group.<br /><br />As for the actual developing story line, I find that the character's traits are emerging episode by episode thereby allowing you to learn about them just as you would if you met someone and learned more and more about them as you spent time with them.<br /><br />I am a bit fan of "Smallville," "Heroes," and "Greatest American Hero." Having been force fed the original Adam West "Batman" series, the very low budget "Spider-Man" and "Hulk" series, and the loathsome "Wonder Woman" fiasco, it is a pleasure to see someone making a realistic approach to making some Superhero series, even if they have to twist around the original concepts to make it believable.
