AND the soundtrack CD too!!!! I watched this BEAUTIFUL movie twice at the Cinema. It has NEVER been on TV here, that I know of.... I used to have the LP record soundtrack but 'lost' it years ago before going overseas (Grrrrr)<br /><br />How do we go about getting a petition or whatever for the film company to release a DVD and CD soundtrack???? Another I'd buy five (5) copies for sure... one for each of my three daughters, (only one was born when the movie was made) and keep two for myself!!! <br /><br />I too discovered John Denver through this movie, but MUCH preferred Cliff De Young singing the Sunshine songs!
