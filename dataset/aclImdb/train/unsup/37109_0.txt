I see no one has reviewed this flick here since 2007. I saw it tonight for the first time, but just wasn't very impressed. We're the Brits really that blas√© when confronted with terror bombings, destroying their homes? It appears everyone just took it all in stride. <br /><br />This flick has no plot what so ever, just a series of scenes that apparently are recollections of the boy, principle character.<br /><br />I guess, this tells us, if indeed these are his memories, all the real terror and sorrow must have been over the decades entirely suppressed.<br /><br />Although joining a gang and seeing his sister behave as a slut, must have made impressions, we just can't quite ring out what the boy is really thinking.<br /><br />Over all a well filmed series of nicely acted pieces, but hardly a winner of an Academy.
