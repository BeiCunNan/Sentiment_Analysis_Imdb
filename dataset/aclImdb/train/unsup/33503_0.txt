I was only 10 years old at the time. Ah, my very own 5 seconds of fame! I know, it's lame but I had never seen the film before today and then it all came back to me when I saw the scene. I can clearly make out one of my friends too. I think we were both on our way to the store and stumbled onto the film set and somehow ended up in the scene. We are in the crowd that follows Claude Atkins as he carries away the kid who is bitten after being stupid enough to climb atop a truck carrying orange crates in a fatal attempt to catch a spider with his bare hands. The scene is filmed in Moorpark, California in front of the Cactus Patch restaurant on High Street (the restaurant is still there and I highly recommend the breakfast plate called the "Riley Special")<br /><br />The movie would put most people to sleep but I enjoyed watching it because it was filmed almost entirely in my home town of Moorpark as well as Piru and Fillmore, which were all combined to comprise the fictional "Finleytown." It was very cool to see all the scenes shot from the air and to realize how much has changed in 30 years.<br /><br />Anyway, its a made for TV flick so don't expect too much and you won't be too disappointed. Then again, you might have better things to do.
