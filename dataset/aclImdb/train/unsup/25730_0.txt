Witnessing the transformation of the main character in this film, I felt as fortunate to be a part of the Desert Film Society's audience as Mr. Walburton stated in the subsequent Q&A he was to play the lead. Analagous to the Mr. Bright being civilized, transformed if you will, in this movie is the marvelous revelation of the viewer that the talent of Mr. Walburton is not limited to sitcoms and animation. Ms. Matiko modestly understated the chemistry that exists between herself and Mr. Walburton on camera during the ensuing questioning session as, in my opinion, a cohesive couple of this caliber is rare even in big production films. Every aspect of the film deserves high praise from the cast to the music, the editing to the makeup. All of these beautiful boughs branch from the tremendous trunk of the solid script designed specifically for Mr. Walburton by his former teacher, Mr. Beaird.<br /><br />At the outset one might be prompted to depart the theater but, much like the example in the film, patience and understanding have their rewards. On the surface it may appear that a mail-order bride might be the cure for a former jock's jerky behavior, but the dialog and performances take the viewer for a trip through the spectrum of emotions. There are directing nuances that remind me of Kubrick, in particular the parallel of montages between Mr. Bright's "male bonding" near the beginning of the movie and the "personal closure" clips in the latter frames. One subtle observance is the relative shakiness of shots at the onset, perhaps analogous to the character's life, later balanced with images obtained from a sturdier camera as the lead role becomes more "grounded." In the end, one will be moved to e-mailing their address list to spread the word about this "indie" and hope one day a DVD copy will be available to share with their children.
