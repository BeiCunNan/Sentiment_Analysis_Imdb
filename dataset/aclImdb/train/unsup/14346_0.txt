The Petrified Forest was the movie that made Humphery Bogart a star. He plays a gangster in this.<br /><br />An English tourist calls for refreshments at a remote café in the middle of the desert and falls in love with the waitress who works there. A group of three then come in and they take the tourist with them to their destination, which they never reach. Their car is hijacked by a gang of four crooks, including murderer Duke Mantee (Bogart), who is wanted all over the States. The tourist makes his own way back to the café and the crooks are not far behind and then they go into the café and hold everyone hostage in there to be joined by the group of three later on. Duke shoots the tourist at the end, escapes and is finally caught by the police just after.<br /><br />The Petrified Forest has very little, if any background music but it doesn't need it as it is gripping enough.<br /><br />Joning Bogie in the cast are Leslie Howard as the tourist, a young Bette Daivs as the waitress, Dick Foran and Joe Sawyer. All play excellent parts, especially Bogie.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching The Petrified Forest and have seen it a couple of times now. Excellent.<br /><br />Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
