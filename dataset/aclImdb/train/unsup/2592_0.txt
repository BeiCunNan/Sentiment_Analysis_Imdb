This sleeper comedy, which happens to be Chris Farley's last movie, is very underrated. Unlike many opinions in the past, I adore the comic interaction between Chris Farley and Matthew Perry. Eugene Levy does a nice job too, although you really have to look to realize that it's him. Hopefully people will realize how funny this movie really is in the future.
