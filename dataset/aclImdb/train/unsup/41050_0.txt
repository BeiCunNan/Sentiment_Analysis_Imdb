I truly felt sorry for the duck disguised as "Karoch, scourge of the skies." A rubber something was fixed across the back of the bird's head to no avail: it still looked a duck. One positive point: the use of authentic Greek words like "Kala" (which actually means "good") and "Econ" (the root of the word "economy" or "home").
