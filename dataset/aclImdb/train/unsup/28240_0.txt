When I had first heard about this movie around about last summer, I was pretty excited to see it, even if people were saying it was a waste of time, I still had to see it because I knew it was based on an actual anime/manga series long ago, and because I'm so heavily into that sort of stuff it was definitely something I was going to see and believe, I walked out of the cinema smiling because I felt really happy and cheerful and I knew it was because of that movie.<br /><br />It's such a brilliant mix of everything, personally I don't think there's anything wrong with it, I know I'm probably too old to like that sort of stuff but I watch anything me if the trailer looks good, I'm more into CGI/animation movies, there's soo much more that they can do compared to live-action and if Astro Boy had been live-action then it wouldn't have been as good because they wouldn't have been able to accomplish half the stuff they did in the CGI version, hell I don't even know how they managed with the live-action series back then :S But seriously, if this is your kind of movie, don't listen to what the bad reviews are telling you, experience it for yourself and just watch it, because it is a really fun/thrilling movie that can really make you smile, just as it did with me :)<br /><br />Another good thing is that they haven't changed anything too drastically, normally when a movie is adapted from TV or a book they tend to change it, sometimes too much but I feel that they have changed it only slightly so that it appeals greater to our modern ages, the great thing though is that Astro is the same.. you know, same name, look, even the undies... but at least he's wearing clothes.. well up until the end... ha ha :D Although I'm not really sure what to think about the new characters apart from the RRF who are just hilarious, but I guess some of the others resemble or remind me of the old ones but the one in particular is Cora, who is mean't to be seen as a potential love interest for Astro (I think...) is just not needed really, I mean she's probably there just to fill up the space, I don't think there's an actual reason, I mean I can't see them getting together and stuff... but maybe that's just me. <br /><br />And to finish off, I have some idea my review is just pathetic and just goes on about how 'great' the movie is.. when it actually is, but I just don't want anyone to get the wrong idea, it has so much in common with the original series that you wouldn't believe, it's rare nowadays that new animation movies have any background history (meaning any cartoons made and shown on TV before the movie) or even anything in common with its previous shows, so it's pretty good to see something like this come out, makes me happy to be the age I am now because when I was young CGI animation just wasn't this good... and that says something cause I'm only 17 ^^ And even if you have never heard of or even watched the original series it doesn't matter because the movie practically starts from scratch anyway if you know what I mean ;) So yeah, enjoy the movie (:
