Jordan Hawley wrote and directed this dark 'comedy' about the current state of love/hate relationships in Los Angeles (or inability to create same) with about as much panache as yesterday's onion rings. The storyline has been used so many times that the tread is off the tires.<br /><br />LA ghostwriter Owen (Paul Schneider) is a 'nice guy' who sustains an inability to form a satisfactory love relationship. Exasperated with his life style he decides to become a cad: that must be what women (and men) want. He reverses his nice guy tactic and begins telling everyone he encounters just how he feels - and that is usually negative! The only person who doesn't but into his change is his roommate Allison (Poppy Montgomery) who is bisexual and therefore not wholly available. He decides to leave Los Angeles and move to the East Coast where a lucrative deal awaits him to write the memoirs of a famous man. At the last moment he meets one Val (Jennifer Westfeldt), an animal activist: the chemistry is there but each has a conflicting program. Owen is honest with her, a factor that does not chase her away, but both part ways to other parts of the world. Upon return to LA after a disappointing experience on the East Coast, tables turn and surprises arise. And the ending is a mixture of silly and unsatisfying.<br /><br />Movies like this are meant to entertain and some of the dialogue is clever albeit acerbic. It just that the idea of relationship examination under these terms is so worn out that the movie just doesn't spark any innovative thoughts. After about thirty minutes into the film this 'audience' lost interest.
