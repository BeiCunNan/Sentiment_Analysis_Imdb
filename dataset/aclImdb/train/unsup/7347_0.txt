This movie comes out of France, with French sensibilities, a steady camera style and some solid emotional acting. The story is set a little bit in the future with some future tech embedded into the details of the visuals in such a way that the future tech is just there, utilized and passed on without remarks or fanfare.<br /><br />Exactly WHAT the crime is can be somewhat obscure and will take some replaying of the dialogue to piece together, but the story has it's own cohesive logic. Why the director made everything BLUE, I don't understand, though I'll ride with it. But be sure that this future is NOT dystopian-- it's just. . .Blue.<br /><br />If you watch it in English, you will notice times when the lips and the dialogue don't quite synch and that can be annoying, although I wager that French speaking viewers will have a more rewarding time of it. Still. . .This movie is thoughtful and different. And thank GOD there's no Shaky Camera here. Also the usual Hollywood Non-Stop Running, Car-chase, Helicopter Raging Gun-battles are missing here-- again because of the different sensibilities. But that makes you pay more attention to the Story about the Crime.<br /><br />Oddly enough, I rate this Sci-Fi movie as "Girlfriend Friendly" for a quiet Saturday Night. Have some Cheesesteaks and Fries ready to go with it.
