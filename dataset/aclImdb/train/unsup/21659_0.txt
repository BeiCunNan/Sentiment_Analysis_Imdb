I watched this show once in mid 90s on Discovery because I saw Connections before this and liked Burke as the narrator. He has the nag to compress data without watering it down or adding pointless drama to it. I remembered only the end and figured if global warming was to happen, Baltic would become the new tropics. This win-win situation helped me a lot.<br /><br />A while ago I saw new Discovery show "Project Earth" with lamebrain ideas to stop global warming and prognoses that anyone can question. Because of their expansive (and none cost-efficient) impractical ideas that I remembered Burkes documentary and decided to review it. Oddly it was for free on YouTube and it was worth it.<br /><br />The first part is based on history before 1990. It may not be perfect but it is worth to watch. I never thought that because of natural temperature change historical events happen. Temperature rise in 300BC melted the Alps for Rome to exploit all year round and then in 450AD it got colder and we got the dark ages. Vikings were dumb and proud to freeze to death rather than plant trees, adapt and survive. I didn't even know that ink could freeze and effect economy of the time. And I really underestimated the chimney. Who knows what you may discover form this show.<br /><br />The only bad side is the second part with speculations about the future. Though after 20 years much was wrong, some thing did come true. Now everyone are consumers, overpopulation is a problem and oil prices went up creating wars for it. And now oil crisis helps make more efficient cars. The rest helps support against global warming speculations. Obviously many things did not happen and we shouldn't be scared by every bad prognosis.<br /><br />The show isn't perfect but it has a lot of real science in it as well as simple cheap alternatives to the problem. I still couldn't figure out why not dump salt in the north of Atlantic to artificially regulate temperature? My favorite part is the ad where parents drive their kids to the dump so not to leave it up to them. I may not be perfect but its old stuff like this that made me more ecofriendly and I recommend this show to you and your kids.
