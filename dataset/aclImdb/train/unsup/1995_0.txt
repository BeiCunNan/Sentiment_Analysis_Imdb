Because of a relentless linearity in the plot, it would be impossible to comment on "Plata Quemada" without creating spoilers. Viewers need to realize that fact at the beginning before reading this or indeed any review.<br /><br />What one has here is classic tragedy played against the background of an inherently tragic reality. Although most reviewers tend to cite analogous story lines from films like "Bonnie and Clyde," "Scarface," or any one of several films based on the Leopold-Loeb case, that line of thinking leaves one with less than meets the eye. We know from the start where this thing is going, so one may fairly discard any pretension of suspense and concentrate instead on character portrayal and other broad strokes of the cinematic artist's brush.<br /><br />This is, in short, a brilliant film whether or not it "goes" anywhere or stumbles on the way. The acting and direction are at worst very respectable, the editing competent, and the visuals and soundtrack really take the breath away. But the centerpiece of it all is how a time and place are captured as representative of decadent society, and how the redemptive power of love can infuse human existence even within such a violent milieu.<br /><br />Cry for Argentina, indeed! The tragedy of Nene and Angel is all the more poignant in that their attempt to flee comes at a time just prior to the imploding of that sad country. Their ascent into self-realization contrasts boldly with the broader descent of social and political institutions that had failed them. It is easy to quibble that their own characters are flawed; such flaws are, however, the very essence of their humanity. Even the otherwise despicable Cuervo is ultimately revealed as worthy of that simple recognition.<br /><br />In short, it is no wonder that Los Mellizos are legend. Whether the film lives up to its claim of being fundamentally a true story is really beside the point. Score 10 of 10.
