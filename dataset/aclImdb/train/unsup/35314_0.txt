This is one of the most inane films I have ever had the misfortune of viewing. It was totally insipid; completely lacking in any entertainment value at all. The dialogue was written on a grade school level, the acting was unbelievably phoney, the story was non-existent. It was supposed to be funny, I know, but something went very wrong during production. George Hamilton was perfect for the part, however. He is a 2-bit actor, therefore, he was just right for this 2-bit effort. Richard Benjamin was pathetic, but maybe it wasn't his fault. Look at the lines he was asked to repeat. This movie was pitiful.
