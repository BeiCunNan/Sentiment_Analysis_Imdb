I picked up the Versache Murder DVD at Big Lots for $3.50... since my wife is a fan of cheesy TV docudramas and true crime books, it seemed perfect, and it was indeed worth every penny.<br /><br />The acting is on par with your average high school drama class production, the plot is almost nonsensical, and the music was... well, nonexistent.<br /><br />I've seen other people comment on the cheesy synth music of this film, but the DVD I bought has no music at all! This leads to numerous bizarre scenes where Andrew is dancing around getting dressed in the morning to silence, roller-blading to silence, dancing in a club to silence... and there is no sound at all during the credits. At first, I thought the director was just being "artsy", but now I know that it was some kind of mistake, but it makes this awful movie even worse, if that's possible.<br /><br />It's the kind of movie you'll watch time and again because it's JUST SO BAD!
