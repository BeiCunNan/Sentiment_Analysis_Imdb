i can proudly say i didn't rent this. my buddies rented this film and made me watch it. it was by far the worst movie i have ever seen. the fight scenes were done with inflatable dolls. the special effects looked like they were done by grade school children. and the only redeeming factor was the nudity which does not make up for all that is lacking in this movie. the acting was horrible as well as was the humor. the parody of the power rangers was very annoying after 3 or more spots in the movie. the soundtrack seemed like it was ripped from a collection of atari games. the star trek references got old after the 2nd jab. and the potty humor was very tiring.
