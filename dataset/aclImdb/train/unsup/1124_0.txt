When the credits rolled on this one, I just sat in sheer amazement. Amazement that this thing had such terrible writing and direction. I can't fault Jackson or Levy, they had to do what they were hired to do, I suppose, but this movie is atrocious, and may be the death knell for 'buddy' movies. Average premise, really good villain, and precious little else. A complete waste of time. Jackson had best start picking his projects with more care, or his career is going to go into the toilet. Worse than many direct-to-video productions. Avoid this like the black plague. Juvenile attempt at comedy, about 3 funny lines, overacting by Jackson, annoying acting by Levy, I can't begin to say what a complete disappointment this movie was, and I'm overwhelmed at all the good comments it's getting here. Just terrible. If Nick Nolte & Martin Short had played the parts, it might have been bearable, but maybe not. I only know there was no chemistry of any kind between Levy & Jackson.
