I found this movie to be of good light entertainment value, but it is a little below the standards I had come to expect of both Cary Grant and Irene Dunne. However, their characters are portrayed with natural ease and charm.<br /><br />The movie is told with Dunne's character, a woman contemplating divorce, reminiscing on happier times with the record she first listened to with her husband spinning. I found this puzzling at the start, but I was merely irritated by the end. <br /><br />There were a few bright moments of comedy, notably the first night of parenting their adopted child. But with elements of drama combined, I was confused when the movie continually lapsed into comedy, then back to tragedy. <br /><br />Comedy was something, described in the words of Dunne herself as "Too easy". This is the first comedy performance of hers I have watched. However, I still prefer her dramatic performances in "I Remember Mama" and "Anna and the King of Siam". As for Grant, "Bringing Up Baby", "The Philadelphia Story", "Holiday" and "His Girl Friday" are much better value for your time.<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie to audiences who appreciate good old fashioned romance. Just start with "An Affair to Remember" first. Rating: 7/10
