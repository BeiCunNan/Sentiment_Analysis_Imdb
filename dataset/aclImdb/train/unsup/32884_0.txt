really one of the worst films in recent memory. and that is saying a<br /><br />lot.<br /><br />what a muddy script and incredibly bad direction. a few people <br /><br />said to me that at least it looked good, but i thought it just looked<br /><br />cheesy - very cliche. <br /><br />one dimensional characters. bad story development. totally<br /><br />fractured. very predictable. badly edited. REALLY badly written. <br /><br />hard to tell if the acting was particularly bad (although i can say<br /><br />with certainty that at least 'the partner' was really awful..) as the<br /><br />actors had NOTHING to work with.<br /><br />amazing that this made it to the big screen..<br /><br />did i mention that it was bad?
