Just an enjoyable time. Haven't laughed that hard at a movie in a LONG time. The story was good, the actors right on, and the location shooting, throughout Indianapolis, was just incredible. Joe Urban showcased a range of emotions and pulled you right into his character, Woody. Jim Peterson's character, Hank, was the comic relief for the film and boy does Jim have great comic timing. And those facial expressions! How wonderful to see Dave Prowse again after all these years (and without his Darth Vader costume), and able to poke fun at himself and the Star Wars legacy. Jennifer Eichler (aka "The Watson's Girl") does a funny cameo as the stereotypical "dumb blonde". George Starkey looks eerily like George Lucas...great casting there. And finally there was Lee Ann Millen. Wow. Interesting character and those costumes ! Carrie Fisher has NOTHING on this gal!<br /><br />The inclusion of the Matrix-like characters just added to the comic feel of this fun movie. Go see it now. You won't regret it.
