I have to admit I rented this title, without really looking at it very closely, for my wife, as I was renting an action movie, for me. We later sat down to watch it, and after about 15 minutes, I was ready to stomp my DVD player into rubble. There's the father who owns a publishing house who is willing to 'do the right thing' whatever the cost. And what is 'doing the right thing' to this apparently well-educated man? Why publishing obscure holocaust tomes over those books more likely to sell (and thereby rescue his company)! I was doing fine, my wife and I actually have more than a passing interest in books and the publishing industry, in general. But when Sarah Jessica Parker, as a recurring character on a children's show, started singing about how she was my 'extraordinary friend', I lost it. I can't remember the last time I've seen so many people engaged in singing their own praises, so to speak. I'd rather have a root canal than sit through this self-serving love fest.
