A limp musical remake of one of the great screwball comedies of all time, "The Awful Truth," this film is a inadvertent valentine to Cary Grant, Irene Dunne and Ralph Bellamy, all of whom are sorely missed. And director Alexander Hall is no Leo McCarey either.<br /><br />The principal actors look desperate, and flail around ineffectually. The songs are weak, but mercifully short. In order not to make Jane Wyman look bad, there are no women on screen under the age of 35. The fashions are without even historical interest, Columbia's colors are rancid, the sets are claustrophobic, the whole proceedings seem strangely depopulated and the action takes place in a vacuum.<br /><br />No wonder people stayed home to watch their new-fangled televisions. This is worse than "The Opposite Sex," MGM's musicalization of "The Women." Don't bother.
