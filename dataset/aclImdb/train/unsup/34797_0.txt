You have to wonder if Pacino even read the script for this brutal film. You're going to die in 88 minutes. Oh really, who is this, he asks not batting an eye? Let me just keep teaching my class while time ticks away. C'Mon.<br /><br />Why can't they make movies where people are actually scared to die? If you got a death threat, wouldn't you be scared shitless. Not Pacino, it's part of the job he says. OK, maybe we can buy that, but then, there's a bomb threat a the university he teaches, no big deal, everyone can just leave the campus. OK we can buy that. His car blows up while he and the red head are a few feet away, are they scared? of course not, they just get up and head to his apartment? OK, not buying that, your car just blew up, shouldn't you be talking to the cops, shouldn't you be scared and sad at your car, it is in fact a Porche no? They get shot at in his apartment, are they scared, nope, just head to the roof? They witness her (red head) ex boyfriend get shot and killed, is she scared, sad, hysterical? Nope, they just keep moving on, Hello, WTF? Can't there be a little reality in these pictures? Deborah Unger's character can't stand Pacino's character? Question is why? We never find out.<br /><br />Pacino just running around trying to solve everything - this film was 88 minutes too long, not even worth to see as a rental.
