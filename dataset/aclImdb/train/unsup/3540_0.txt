I saw Scrapple at the 1998 Breckenridge Film Fest. The description of the film read, "Pigs, drugs, and ski bums." I was intrigued, to say the least, by what would be my favorite film of the festival.<br /><br />The opening credit scenes had me believing I was watching a movie that was filmed in the mid '70s. By the second scene I knew I was in for a great film. Having lived in ski towns for the past 10 years, I can safely say that Scapple does an outstanding job of relaying the universal, timeless truisms of ski town life.<br /><br />Entertaining, funny, and cinematically beautiful, the film sends a small message that hits close to home. During the story we fall in love with Al Dean, the king of blind luck, in his efforts to make things right.<br /><br />This is a film that was put together remarkably well, especially for a first time, independent project. After seeing a movie like Scrapple, one wonders how this film isn't being distributed on a national level, when so many undeserving movies are. I suppose blame lies in the unenlightened viewing public and not in the quality of the film, as Scrapple is the most underrated film I have yet to see.<br /><br />Kudos to the Hanson brothers for their grassroots efforts to get this movie seen by appreciative moviegoers.
