(3/10). The first thing that meets you in this film is a voice belonging to a darkhaired girl. And it is an annoying voice that is. There is plenty of voice overs in this film and this F***ING annoying voice is going at it. Bla, bla, bla. How the hell could they cast Mila Kunis for this movie. How the hell could they make this movie. I guess they just wanted to make more money and fool people who liked the first. Thank god it didn't cost me anything to see it. Let this be a warning: If there is a sequel made by people who had nothing to with the first it's probably going to suck. Which probably means that Terminator 3 is going to suck... too bad. All in all this is a stinker. And if you didn't figure that out just look at the tagline: ANGRIER. DEADLIER. SEXIER. Says it all.
