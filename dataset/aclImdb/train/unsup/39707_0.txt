With some films, (records, football matches), it's a question of hitting the right note at the right time. They may seem awful now, but you were there, and it felt good. Sometimes it's all about who you sat alongside. Before Night Falls may have been good - it was certainly depressing. I couldn't take it.<br /><br />Movies were our first outlet for fun. They weren't enough anymore. I'm sorry M. Please forgive me.<br /><br />Ron (Viewed 18Jun01. Left in tears after thirty minutes.)
