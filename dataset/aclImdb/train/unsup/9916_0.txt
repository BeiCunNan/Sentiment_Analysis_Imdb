This movie is a lot like the movies High Tension, and Creep. It revolves around a lighthouse with a killer on the loose, knocking off every few minutes one more casualty. Although the story is nothing original, the writing, and directing are top-notch and worthy. The movie looks, and feels like a high-budget, blockbuster movie. From my Country of Origin, this movie has a very thrilling and is one of the best slasher films I have ever seen.<br /><br />This is the first lighthouse type movie I have ever seen, and I think it will remain the best for a while (in my perspective!).<br /><br />For the overall work and amazing atmosphere, I give this movie a cheering 9/10.
