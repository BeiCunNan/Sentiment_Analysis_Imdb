Yes! Another superhero film comes and goes! What I love about these kinds of films are that we have the hero. We have the villain. We have a damsel in distress. Heck, we even have a problem in the world, like a shortage of cows, or that we need help opening a nasty carton of milk! This movie, "Captain America," does all of that. No, there isn't anything in this movie that has to do with cows or opening milk cartons or anything. However, there is the hero, Captain America, and the villain, The Red Skull, and so forth.<br /><br />"Captain America" is a superhero movie that may not be as exciting as "Spider-Man," but believe me, if you are lucky enough to find a copy (and they are extremely difficult to come by nowadays!), then you can watch this movie and see what all the buzz is about.
