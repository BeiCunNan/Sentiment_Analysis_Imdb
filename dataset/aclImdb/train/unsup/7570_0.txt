This was my introduction to the ever lovely, the captivating and totally enchanting Ms. Mundae. Seduction Cinema has quite a few of these erotic parodies, and most, fortunately for them, star the incredibly irresistible Misty Mundae. Production values are of the B-movie variety, (do people still really say B-movie anymore?), but once you get past that, it is very entertaining and erotic in a very down to earth kind of way. The best thing about any of these films is Misty, as she is able to carry off this witty, charming on-screen persona that just blows you away, time after time. She delivers most of the lines with tongue planted firmly in cheek, and metaphorically winks at the audience with every cheesy line and action she goes through....Misty Mundae is able to pull off something very few other actors could, and her commanding presence and on-screen charisma suck you in, and intrigue you in ways that endear you to her character and her portrayal, and simultaneously enable you to overlook the overall quality of the material, and whatever other shortcomings the film may have. Misty delivers a few one-liners that will make you ROFL if you are able to experience this film is the right spirit, and she along with this film, will inspire you to catch her other Seduction Cinema films, that I'm confident will surely delight on the basis of Misty's appeal alone. I enjoyed this film as well as Play-mate of the Apes, and her others strictly because of her beguiling, overwhelming and underrated talent as an actress. In the end, Lord of the G-Strings succeeds in part because it doesn't take itself too seriously, but mostly because it has the appeal of the "real deal", a true diamond in the rough, with the multi-talented, naturally beautiful and irresistible charming; Misty Mundae!
