This is a terribly unprofessional documentary that looks more like a home movie. I can forgive that, though. What I can't forgive is the narrator's VOICE! I'm surprised that no one else has mentioned his tone of voice as a detraction. Throughout the entire film he sounds like a robot, quite obviously reading from a paper. It really sucks any life this film might have possibly had out. The film itself is monumentally bad as well. You don't get any feel for Pla as a person, and it follows no coherent storyline. I've never been to Thailand (I'm planning on studying there in the near future as an exchange student, and was searching for information on the web when this film came to my attention), but I honestly feel like I know more about the country than the filmmaker does. And I know nothing about the country that hasn't been gleaned from Google searches, so that should give you a clue about how much he apparently knows. Sorry, Mr. Clark, but it just didn't work for you. Better luck next time! By the way, if you're looking for a good documentary that's interesting and follows a plot, check out The Great Happiness Space--Tale of an Osaka Love Thief by Jake Clennell.
