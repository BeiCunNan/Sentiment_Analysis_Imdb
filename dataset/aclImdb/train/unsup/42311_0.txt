It comes around most summers, the flurry of hype and advertising surrounding the latest Harry Potter instalment, and every critic claims it is The Best One Yet, the reviews all say Harry Potter Shows Its Dark Side and everyone comments on how they are Maturing As Actors.<br /><br />And we all go to see it. And we all come out claiming "never again".<br /><br />This time is not too different. The acting has improved dramatically, although there are still a few cringe-worthy moments. Tom Felton (Malfoy) is the most impressive, with much more to do in this instalment than the others. Radcliffe exhibits good comic timing for once. The adult cast are as dependable as ever, Rickman, Bonham Carter and Broadbent are all fantastic, and Michael Gambon puts in his best so far.<br /><br />However, it is still not worth going to see by any stretch of the imagination. Some snippets are brilliantly done, the CGI better than ever, the opening shot is good, and the memory scenes especially are done perfectly, exactly as imagined. But these are gems hidden with in two and a half hours of dirge.<br /><br />I've heard, as a fan of the books, many others disgusted with the amount left out from them. This I don't mind in the slightest, it would be ridiculous to include all of the intricate subtle storyline twists that make the series so great. It's the embellishments and contrived utter rubbish that has been actually added to the movie that made me feel a little sick.<br /><br />I understand taking liberties with the plot line... but not if it turns a fantastic book into a dismal film! The emphasis on the romantic storyline (a relatively minor part in the book) was woeful, to the point I had to bite my lip to avoid shouting expletives at the screen. The ending also seems to have been completely misunderstood, the agony in the book being Harry physically cannot move to protect his mentor. I won't even vent my feelings on the burning of the Burrow.<br /><br />Having said that, the whole cave scene, from beginning to end, is fantastically done.<br /><br />It's just a pity the rest is so undeniably awful.<br /><br />Don't put yourself through it this year.
