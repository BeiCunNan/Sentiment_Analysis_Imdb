This movie is build up to be a romantic fun little comedy but it turns out to be one of the most depressing movies ever made! Sure Drew Barrymore was perfect for the role but all through out the movie the thought was nothing worse could happen to her and believe it or not- IT DID! However, it was very remarkable how Drew Barrymore character kept strong and got through them but like I said- very depressing.
