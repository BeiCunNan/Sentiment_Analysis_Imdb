To some it may be a close call to make but I am certain that this is still the best Hollywood-on-Hollywood film of all time. I'm sure many will disagree but I believe this is a much underrated, under-appreciated and lesser known film than the more famous Billy Wilder-directed 1950 classic. I liked the way this film merely touched upon characters in Hollywood at the time instead of pointing them out so blatantly and giving them cameo appearances as 'Sunset Blvd' did. Overall, 'The Bad and The Beautiful' is a far more subtle film. I am sure those few others who have seen it will agree that it is quintessential Kirk Douglas and a brilliant film in its own right without being 'compared' to death. But for those out there who find comparing utterly irresistible I would say that 'Beautiful' has better acting and a better script while 'Boulevard' has superior direction and more entertainment value. And don't just dismiss me before you've actually seen the two.
