Blondie. Ramones. Talking Heads. With a roster like that, you'd think this documentary of the legendary 70s CBGB scene would kick ass, right? Well, sorry to say it doesn't. What we have here is home movie footage of the bands in action with rare demos playing in the background. The songs don't sync up with the bands. Worth it only for die-hard fans of the artists featured, really no one else.<br /><br />Don't you hate it when you search for a video of a band online and all you get is a twenty second clip taken from a cell phone video camera? This is the cinematic equivalent. "Another State of Mind", "The Decline of Western Civilization", and "End of the Century" are all superior punk rock docs. (2/10)
