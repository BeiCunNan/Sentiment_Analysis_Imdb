This film could have been better if the acting was better. Jason Ritter is riding on the coattails of his late dad. Certainly he is no John Ritter.The vastly underrated, John Ritter had range and went from slapstick to straight man comedy to drama in 'Sling Blade' and did it well. His range was terrific. Jason Ritter playing the bad boy bully , stalking his nemesis in college was ineffective. Than again, none of the actors shined in this film. This was just a bad effort all around. There was no acting chemistry or believability. Certainly getting lost in this plot was impossible. The shame of it all, is that the movie , with better acting could have worked. The plot ,itself, was interesting. Articulation there was none. Direction .. Nothing. This film could have been a contender , instead, collectively , it fell flat on its face.
