Pardon my adolescent summary, but it's accurate. I promise. This movie is only marginally watchable. I was completely unconvinced by the female lead who looks like a Playmate stuffed into a forest ranger's uniform (oh, and she's supposed to be a former Marine, too...I actually giggled when she said that). Obviously, Richard Christian Matheson and Thomas E. Szollosi have seen JEEPERS CREEPERS. Hmmm, let's see...a mysterious creature that can regenerate, has wings, and is seriously intelligent enough to mess with it's victims minds before killing them...? Yeah, okay. Movie rip-offs are only par for the course (especially in the horror genre), and I really don't mind someone else's idea expanded on, so to speak, but when your goal is no better than taking someone else's idea and regressing it to the same old, please don't bother. There's nothing new here, folks.
