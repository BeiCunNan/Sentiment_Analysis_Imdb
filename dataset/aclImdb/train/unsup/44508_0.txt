Possibly the worst film I have ever seen, "The Visitor" has many disconnected plot elements that never seem to go anywhere or make any sense. Guys wandering the desert, giant green clouds billowing up from nowhere, spirals of birds whirling indoors...as a series of unconnected images, I suppose the movie may have value, but as a story it is completely worthless. I saw this theatrically on its initial release and hated it; I tried to watch it again a decade later. I thought, "It couldn't really be as bad as I remember," but it was and I fell asleep as it dragged on. Totally awful.
