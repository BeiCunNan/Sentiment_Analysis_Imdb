The poster says: "The Best British Horror Film Of The Year". That may very well be true. But that's like saying "the most successful basketball team England has ever had".<br /><br />TZD tries to put seriousness back into the zombie genre, but there is one essential catch: no matter what kind of make-up you give them, zombies are still silly, comical creatures. Hence almost any attempt to "documentarize" this genre is bound to fail - especially if the attempt is located on British soil, where bad horror films are made on a regular basis. The makers of this dull turd obviously thought that wobbling the camera enough would create that elusive realistic feel. How wrong they were. All that the shaky camera achieves is make the viewer dizzy and annoyed. I don't know about you, but when watching a movie I'd prefer to SEE the events unfold, as opposed to have to GUESS what's going on on the screen. At times the camera zig-zagged as if operated by a vodka-addicted 4 year-old. Screw von Trier and other pretentious camera-wobblers. If they are your inspiration and influence then you might as well leave film-making to those who do not make the cameraman stand on a large rubber ball when shooting scenes.<br /><br />The first 15 minutes were painfully slow. Far from getting the feeling I was watching a documentary, I had more the impression I was watching someone's first student film. Things only get slightly more interesting (i.e. less dull) later, but then that awfully stupid ending ruins whatever minimal chances this movie had of being even semi-passable. The filmmakers reserve the ending for a serial-killers-on-the-loose plot, forgetting the zombies, the "stars", of this film totally.<br /><br />The one positive thing I can say is that the zombies didn't run or talk; at least they behaved like "proper" zombies. However, I didn't understand why these heavily-armed survivors panicked so much nearly every time they were faced with those slow-moving, confused, dumb creatures. Placing a bullet into the head of such undead morons should be easier than stepping on an ant. The way rednecks quickly turn zombie-hunting into a cheerful sporting exercise in "Dawn Of The Dead" (1976) has far more realism, even though that movie was a bit of a comedy, too.<br /><br />The actors playing the survivors look even more sleepy than the zombies...<br /><br />I was thinking... What if zombies really did take over the Earth in some silly hypothetical scenario?... Would the Human Rights Watch take their side, as they usually do with all mindless killers? <br /><br />For my music-related rants, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/
