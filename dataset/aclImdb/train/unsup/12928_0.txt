I saw this film several years ago on television here in France and thought it was great. It was so eerie and atmospheric. Jean Simmons was lovely and fetching as young Caroline whose evil Uncle Silas, played superbly by Derrick DeMarney and his unscrupulous cohort Madame Rougierre try to do away with her in a gloomy mansion along with the aid of Silas's son Dudley (Katina Paxinou is brilliant as Madame). Unfortunately, I didn't have a VCR back then and so I couldn't record it. Now that I have gotten a video recorder, the only place that I've found it to be available is over in the States. They only carry the American released version from the early 1950's when Jean Simmons really caught on over there. The films title was changed to "The Inheritance" and a scene where Uncle Silas has Dudley propose marriage to Caroline had been cut by the censures (incest was taboo in American cinema back then). Uncle Silas then forces Dudley to leave the house only to sneak him back later in the wee hours of the morning. In the American print we are not sure who that someone is (or why someone is being sneaked back into the house). It would seem confusing if you had never see the uncut British original. Lastly, in the British version Uncle Silas overdoses and dies. For some strange reason, in the American version he kills himself with a self inflicted gun shot wound. If you can get the British one, do. If not, the American release copy is a worthy second. **** out of **** stars. P.S. It's also a great book ("Uncle Silas" by J.S.LeFanu) and it's back in print!
