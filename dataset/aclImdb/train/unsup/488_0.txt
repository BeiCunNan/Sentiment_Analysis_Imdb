If Blues Brothers is in my "top ten", this sequel in in my "last ten"!!! I found the screenplay terrible, trying to remind the scenes of the original movie... resulting in a complete defeat!!! Demential humor must be intelligent too. This seems to be a commercial operation only (like highlander 2!)... just one thing: I cannot comment the last 30 min... because I fell asleep!<br /><br />my rate: 3/10
