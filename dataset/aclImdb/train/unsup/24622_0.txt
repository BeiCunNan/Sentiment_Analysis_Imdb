Had no idea just how I was going to enjoy this film and quickly found myself glued to the TV where these Foreign Press correspondences take photos among and around the people in Uzbekistani and dealing with Muslin rebel forces and bullets flying over their heads. Jeff Goldblum (Ben Donsmore) experiences his partner being killed and his replacement is Lake Bell, (Nora Stone) who makes all kinds of mistakes with her photos and Ben is ready to get rid of her and send her back to the States. This film has many twists and turns and there is plenty of romance and love making especially with Louise Lombard,(Gayle Phalan) who seems to jump from one bedroom to another through out the entire film. This film will appeal to almost anyone who likes action and also a few female actors who add some sex appeal.
