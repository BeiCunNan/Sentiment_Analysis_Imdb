Thinking that old Bollywood movies are filled with too much dialogue and/or extensive action sequences, I wasn't too thrilled watching this movie. Surprisingly this movie does not have neither, and is an excellent movie. The plot is nice and original. The movie is excellent in screenplay and editing. The action sequences are well done especially for a 70's film. The casting in the movie is excellent. The star of the movie is Amitabh Bachchan. Though I expected him to be the down point because he was playing a Christian, he pulls it off with lots of confidence which proves he is a legend in Bollywood. The second star was without a doubt Vinod Khanna. He fits his character so perfectly, I don't think Vinod was being anyone but himself. Rishi Kapoor was good as well, but against the two other stars he pales in comparison. However, his comedy scenes with Neetu Singh's father are memorable. The female star is definitely Parveen Bhabi. She looks amazing and also has loads of confidence. Second is Neetu Singh. She looks pretty, but adds lots of comedy and needs to come back to movies. Shabana Aazmi isn't in many scenes, but she looks beautiful and adds lots of charm. The songs fit the movie well. My favorite is Parda Hai Parda, but Rishi Kapoor is too jumpy in the song. Otherwise the rest of the songs are terrific, and the movie is deserved to be watch.
