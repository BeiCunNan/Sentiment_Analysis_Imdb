Unfortunately, the late, great Joe D'amato left his favorite horror format for this mixed-up caper of romance, revenge and the powers men and women hold over each other.<br /><br />There is very little gore here, but many relationships. This spells disaster for a Joe D'amato Pic.<br /><br />Obviously, Joe wanted to branch out from his usual Gore and Chicks flicks..but this bomb will put you to sleep...or hurt your finger from holding down your VCR's Fast Forward key.<br /><br />Take my advice, Skip It!
