I happened upon this short movie while flipping around channels and since it was so short, I decided to see just what it had to offer. Unfortunately, it offered VERY little. Whether I consider directing, acting, cinematography, screenplay or score, it's sorely lacking in quality. Fellow commenter Jeff from LA states, "...it has a positive message that any Christian should be able to relate to." This may well be true, but since the stated intention of the film was to speak to non-believers in a meaningful way, I'd say this film fails miserably.
