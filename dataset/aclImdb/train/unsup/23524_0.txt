Wow, this movie was amazing. Ladies, don't turn off the TV too quickly; even though the beginning may appear to be a "guy flick", this is a very moving film. TRUST ME, you'll end up wanting your boyfriend to see it because it clearly depicts what CAN happen when a boy doesn't know when to say "enough is enough" and take, albeit giant for some, that step into becoming a responsible man.<br /><br />Being a young adult male, I was quite taken at the way I felt at the movie's conclusion in comparison to how I felt at it's opening. I actually laughed out loud at some of my own memories of the "dog days". I am grateful that, in my early 30's, I discovered things about women other than just sex. However, in Jack's case, the toll of his foolishness cost him something far greater than money or fame.<br /><br />In my life, I have friends who resemble Jack. I only pray they will figure it all out before finding a wife and having children. Life is far too long to live it alone.<br /><br />This movie will make you laugh and it will make you cry. Nestor and Andrew give an outstanding performance. And for all the "dogz" out there, this movie is packed with TNA. Uh, sorry about that .. I am a man, after all.
