Don't get me wrong by the suummary as I enjoyed this movie very much. Bernhardt plays an ex-Navy SEAL who is forced to murder a corporate executive after the Yakuza kidnap his daughter. Their is a subplot involving Bernhardt and the Yakuza boss...oh, and Naval Intelligence and the local police are after him, too! Gunfights, fistfights and a slam-bang ending make this a watchable film. Bernhardt definitely has the looks and talent to become the next action star. Check him out in Bloodport 2, 3 & 4, MK: Conquest (on TV) or watch for him in the upcoming Matrix sequels!
