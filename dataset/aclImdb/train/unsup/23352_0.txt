Caught a screener of Praey but wasn't expecting much. To my surprise I was thoroughly entertained for an hour & 1/2. The plusses: good story, compelling lead actress, enough plot twists & turns to keep me interested, a strong ending, a middle eastern guy who reminded me of great bit players from the 1940s and an overall professional look about it. The negs: dragged a teeny little bit, somewhat weak villain, a very slow couple of opening scenes that could lose you if you don't hang in long enough. I don't understand the title and maybe that could be changed. Some scenes play like thrillers and some play like horror. The director managed to bring it all together and make it very easy to follow and the plot was engrossing once things got started. Should this director make another film I will certainly look for it and watch it.
