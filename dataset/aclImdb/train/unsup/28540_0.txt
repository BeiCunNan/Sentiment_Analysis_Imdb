This last film was probably the most powerful of the BMWfilms.com series. Tense, riveting look at the life and death of a news cameraman. You learn more about this character than in many action full length films. Clive Owen also gets a chance to use his acting skills, certainly more than in the previous BMWfilms.com series. A gem of a film.
