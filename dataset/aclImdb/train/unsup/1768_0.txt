Squaresoft's (now Square-Enix) highly anticipated "Final Fantasy VIII" released in February of 1999 in Japan, and later in September 1999 for the United States and Europe. It got mixed reviews, but one thing is for certain, it definitely was a starting map for the way games are done today.<br /><br />The first time I played this game, I was totally blown away. It's also become one of my most treasured and beloved games of all time. The romantic and emotional storytelling the game presents is superb, and will definitely leave its mark on you forever. This game is so incredible, that you might actually break into tears at the end.<br /><br />Telling the story of lone wolf Squall Leonhart, who is looking forward to joining an elite military organization named SeeD. His life takes a drastic change when he meets the warm-hearted and gentle Rinoa Heartilly. However, this developing friendship is attacked when an evil sorceress named Edea gets involved into the lives of The World, with her own plans that could shift the balance of power everywhere. SeeD is dispatched to eliminate her, which is where Final Fantasy VIII begins.<br /><br />Featuring music by the astonishing and refreshing Nobou Uematsu, which will simply blow you out of your shoes. Adding to the game's soundtrack is Faye Wong's "Eyes On Me", which holds a special place in my heart and is the song which got me into Faye's music. An underrated Final Fantasy game, in which deserves a big round of applause. Two big thumbs up.
