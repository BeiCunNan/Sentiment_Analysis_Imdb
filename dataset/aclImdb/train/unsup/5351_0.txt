Its hard to think this was made in 2005. Its obvious that there wasn't much money spent on special effects. The film was actually so bad that it was quite funny (unintentionally!). The balloon ride and the giant rat were effects that one would expect to see in a 1960 movie. Patrick Stewart must have been hard up for money to add his name to this rubbish! The story was weak and didn't stick to the original book. The acting was wooden with the actors merely going through their paces. Vinny Jones looked and sounded like he had just stepped off a Birds Eye ad with a thoroughly clich√©d interpretation of a pirate captain. This film tried to cash in on the success of The Pirates of the Caribbean but guys without spending some money - leave it to the professionals.
