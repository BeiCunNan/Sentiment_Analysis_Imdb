I have loved this film for years. There are some unforgettably hysterical moments in this movie that will have your friends in stitches when you recount them. This move also shows us the vulnerability of people negotiating a relationship which is rarely seen on screen. It portrays people and a romance that is real. The actors and characters are not the fit-firm-20- somethings with perfect hair, clothes, and make-up. They are people who are average and flawed. The story line reflects the difficulty of finding a mate who is genuinely a good match. It also addresses the reality of life after divorce in our culture. The relationship between the main characters (and others) is honest and I really appreciate that. The movie accurately portrays some of the milestones of building a truly loving relationship. Trust, love, and commitment are developed when we are tested and choose one another again and again, through good times and bad. I continue to love this movie, I think I'll watch it tonight.
