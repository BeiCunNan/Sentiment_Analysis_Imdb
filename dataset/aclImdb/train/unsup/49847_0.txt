sorry people: no amount of pseudo-intellectual drivel can justify the dog's breakfast. a horror movie with no actual horror? that's not experimental, that's crap. whoever said movies about images and not story is totally, completely, wrong. Paintings are about images. Movies are about story, plot, characterisation...these things a movie make. if images are your thing, go to a gallery. don't try and excuse self-indulgent cinematic vomit. this film takes an hour and a half for nothing to happen; when it does, it's out of the blue, out of context and out of proportion. the preceding ninety minutes do nothing to build suspense, they are merely boring. nothing about the characters is explained, no back-story is given, and when the inevitable violence occurs, it's relief to know that these two examples of human excrement will not disgrace our screens further. i want my two hours back. rapid painful death to those who drive hummers.
