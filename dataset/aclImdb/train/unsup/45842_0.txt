Chuck Norris is a terrible actor. He may be good at that karate stuff that he does, but that's all he has going for him. Well, I guess the ladies like his body (I know of a couple who do). The story stinks, the acting stinks, the special effects are decent, but pretty much everything else about this film stinks. It smacks of patriotism and tries to strike that chord in the viewer. It fails at that by being just plain blatant. Overall, a real lousy film. Don't waste your time.
