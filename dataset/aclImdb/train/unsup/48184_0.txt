The biggest surprise about this movie, is the fact it was not made by Jess Franco. This is infact a brazilian movie, and a standard women in prison one as well. Three bad girls are thrown in jail. Naturally, they are submitted to all kind of degredations. They escape, and are captured again. Even though they are the heroes of this movie, justice must be done, and the girls are thrown back behind bars. This "twist" is the only thing slightly surprising about the movie. The copy I have seen, contains several brief hardcore sexscenes, that seems to have been left in the movie by mistake. The scenes are, however, performed by the leads themselves, leading to the conclution, that this movie (like many Jess Franco movies that it resembles) also excists somewhere as a hardcore movie. The movie also, unwisely, combines humour and torturescenes. A bad movie alltogether. For WIP completeists only.
