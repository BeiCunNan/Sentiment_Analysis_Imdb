I think I have pretty much seen all of the movies associated with the civil war in Yugoslavia. Unlike many that take sides and immediately turn off one segment of the viewers this is one I could recommend to my friends who no nothing about the war. No one here is a good guy, in fact everyone is bad to a degree, especially when you understand who everyone is (a fact not readily understandable to the casual viewer).<br /><br />Like most films that deal with real human tragedy, it is hard to watch at times. But in the end it is worth it. I'm glad nothing good comes out of this film because nothing good came out of a war that destroyed a beautiful nation and turned brother against brother all in the name of fighting an ethnic war left over from ancient history. Think about it. The Turkish, the Byzantine and the Hapsbugh empires have all disappeared into the sands of time and these poor fools were convinced that this was still a war worth fighting? How ridiculous.
