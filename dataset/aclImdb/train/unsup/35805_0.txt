Yet another lame voodoo flick. Following the resurrection of a dead native girl, a french police officer from the mainland arrives to the island and takes an immediate disliking as to the place's condition. This is mainly pertaining to the strange rituals conducted by the natives who often sacrifice their own. Boris Karloff, in nearly his last film, plays a plantation owner who is experimenting with telekinetic manipulation and is involved in a skinny white guy and his midget friend's enslaving of native girls, via voodoo... I'm getting bored just thinking about this movie. Hell, I think that was what was going on... Maybe I missed the films point entirely. Or maybe there was no point! There was also a lot of snake fondling and a jiggly hipped belly dancer. Karloff does nothing of any great importance in here and the characters are all flat and tiring to look at after a while. Just a visually and mentally unenjoyable film.
