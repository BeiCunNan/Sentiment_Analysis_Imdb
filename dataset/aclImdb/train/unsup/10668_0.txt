(WARNING - CONTAINS MILD SPOILER) The somewhat unresolved nature of the very last scene is ultimately dissatisfying, leaving a feeling that the film may have been inherently overly familiar - a chronicle of a straight- laced, unsatisfied couple who taste forbidden fruit and are almost ruined by it. The film's air of calm scrutiny is generally engrossing though, as it sketches the quiet disappointments and compromises of rural small business; a life caught up by routine, where years go by without a vacation. The plot initially finds the couple fascinated by sheer difference, leaving an enjoyable ambiguity as to whether there's any real sexual attraction on Berling's part toward Merhar, or whether it's largely a matter of intertwined ego, loneliness, and a symbolic yielding to the limitations of his life (the sexual encounter here looks like a pure power play). But the film's restraint makes it easy to take for the most part as a low-key, well-observed black comedy, thriving on the contrast between the ultra-orderly dry cleaning business and the flashy excess of the cross-dressing scene.
