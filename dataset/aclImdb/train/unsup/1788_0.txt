In the second installment to the highly successful "Beverly Hills Cop" trilogy, we find Axel Foley(Eddie Murphy) returning once again to Beverly Hills to solve crime. This time Axel is trying to solve the shooting of Captain Bogomil(Ronny Cox). As Axel digs deeper, he discovers that Bogomil had been on the trail of a group of bank robbers, which are headed by Maxwell Dent(Jurgen Prochnow), who just so happens to own an exquisite Beverly Hills gun club. So Axel reunites with old buddies Billy Rosewood(Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart(John Ashton) to go and solve the crime.<br /><br />Being that this is the second film in the trilogy, one would expect "Beverly Hills Cop II" to either be a step up or a step down from the first film. "Beverly Hills Cop II" tries to be stylish but can't even though it's in the hands of Tony Scott, director of 1986's "Top Gun". The action here is a lot wilder too, but after a while it starts to get pointless, especially in the ending shoot-out. Of course, Eddie Murphy saves this film from being another average action-comedy, which is good. So when you watch this film, try to be fair in judging in it.<br /><br />I give "Beverly Hills Cop II" an 8/10.
