Okay, I know that my one line summary might give the impression that this film isn't half bad but don't be fooled, it's absolute rubbish. It's just that after watching films like 'Hobgoblins' and that pumaman nonsense this doesn't seem that bad. It's all about this scientist who, using deep hypnosis, manages to actually send his subject, a very thin woman, back in time. Why, we're not really told though I assume it's for the furtherance of science. There follows a series of badly filmed, badly scripted, usually unconnected scenes involving the time-travelling woman, a 'hero' (A loose term I know), a couple of witches, an imp and a mad (Or just confused) gravedigger fond of singing. It truly is terrible, watching the fight scenes prove this undeniably, but the acting isn't always grade z, though it is so stereotypical you'll want to throw your head back and laugh. Heartily. Why did the bad witch need to cut that guys head off? How bad was the acting of the imp? And where did all those town folk come from?? All these questions and more will not be answered no matter how many times you watch this film. Have fun.
