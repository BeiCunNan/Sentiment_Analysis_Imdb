Horrible movie, but quite funny too! Lots of crummy fights, stupid dialog, topless chicks, and a boring story too! It's another one of those so-bad-its-good films, which I always love. But after reading some of the comments on here, I should explain something.<br /><br />I first watched this film dubbed as American Streetfighter 2 like most of you seemed to have. It was the bonus movie on the other side of the DVD of the first American Streetfighter film. Well if you watch American Streetfighter 2, you'll not only notice it's horribly edited, but it seems to be missing numerous scenes, makes little sense, and has nothing to do with the first film. This is because this is actually the movie "Full Impact" ripped apart with crappy added flashback scenes from the first movie, and called American Streetfighter 2. The problem is that Full Impact was never meant to be a sequel to American Streetfighter. Sure it has some of the same cast, but they're completely different characters and this is a totally new story. Why they did this is beyond me...maybe the thought the movie would do better labeled as a sequel?<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, go out and buy the actual DVD labeled Full Impact. It's the complete movie with all the correct scenes in place, and without those horrible pointless flashback scenes from American Streetfigher 1. Not to mention the picture quality is much improved. So if you've only seen this as American Streetfighter 2, don't judge this movie yet. See Full Impact, then you'll see the complete film that actually makes sense!
