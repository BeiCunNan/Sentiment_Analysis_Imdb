Treat Williams stars as Karl Thomasson who this time teaches at colleges where steroid abuse is a problem and in which the mobsters in question are needed to be straightened out once and for all. Also he is teaching there because his friend's daughter (Rebecca Staab) was attacked by the said mobsters. The Substitute 3:Winner Takes It All is easily the worst of my killer teacher binge that started with Class Of 1984 and ended with Substitute 4. I think the real problem with this entry is that not only does it stink to high heaven but because there is a lack of action we are forced to watch an anti drug message delivered with all the subtleness of a brick through a window. The third chapter consists of Williams kicking some student's asses but in reality he is more engaged with fighting the mob and therefore the whole story loses it's edge. Also of note is that Claudia Christan (So hot in The Hidden) is ultimately wasted as one of the hero's sidekicks and although she is a woman that even I would be afraid to mess with in real life, her character is too lightweight. Williams who brought much charisma to earlier roles such as Things To Do In Denver When You Are Dead and Once Upon a Time In America (Even in Substitute 2) is surprisingly flat here. The audience on the other will be too bored or busy rolling their eyes to derive much interest in either case.<br /><br />1/2* out of 4-(Awful)
