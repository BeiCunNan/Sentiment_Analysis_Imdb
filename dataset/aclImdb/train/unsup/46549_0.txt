I think there is a big problem with this film because it is so much imitating American films. And not just those. A little of everything the director likes. Acting is very bad and unconvincing. I was very disappointed. So many shots that don't carry none significance at all. It seems like they tried everything. Such a subject, such a psychological subject and they gave more attention to shots and none to relations and emotions. I wrote a message on a message board about this film. I really don't believe that this film is good just because it looks like it's from USA. Yes it's a big subject, Balzac and Dostoyevski wrote about it long before we were all born, but it was done so weakly. The whole cinema laughed at loud when an actor called Manda appeared on the screen, even tough it was not supposed to be funny. That is not good for the film. I mean there are two parents who are in a situation worst for any parent, and two of them are acting so weak. That's a director's mistake.
