So that might sound like damning with faint praise, but in fact i really like this movie. The fight scenes are easily the best i've seen in a pre-Kill-Bill western movie (and that includes Jet Li and Jackie Chan's Hollywood efforts) - Mark Dacascos is really amazing, the choreography is spectacular, and the editing for once allows us to appreciate it.<br /><br />That alone would be enough for me to recommend this film, but the bits inbetween are an unexpected pleasure as well. Dacascos is likable enough (though i don't understand why he pulls his trousers up so high) but Hardison steals the show with some great lines. I don't know why he hasn't made it bigger. As for Brittany Murphy, i can't figure out if all that stuff was in the script or if she's making it up as she goes along, but again it's pretty funny.<br /><br />Overall, a likable, unpretentious film with great action scenes and more than it's share of laughs. Recommended.
