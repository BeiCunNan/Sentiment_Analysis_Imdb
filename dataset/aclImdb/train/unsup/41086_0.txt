I used to watch the 80s series remake of "Mission Impossible" and feel this movie is largely "Mission Impossible" in title only. <br /><br />It's really just a big star vehicle and money-making enterprise for Tom Cruise.<br /><br />Sure, it's an entertaining mindless romp that will keep your brain happily in neutral for a few hours and that may be all you're after.<br /><br />The revelation of who is the true villain will anger some fans such as myself. <br /><br />It really wasn't anything like the 80s "Mission Impossible" I remember. What about the comraderie between characters? What about the team effort thing? These things are missing because it's Tom Cruise Vs the rest of the world.<br /><br />The best thing about the film is Larry Mullen Jnr and Adam Clayton from U2 being on the soundtrack.
