This is one of the worst films i've had the misfortune of seeing in the theater. It was showing at the CMJ convention in New York back when it first came out, and that was quite possibly the films only stint in theaters. The acting is poor, the story is far worse, and we walked out when we'd reached our breaking point. Luckily since we had passes for the convention, it was free, but even then i felt ripped off. As for a plot summary, imagine a completely cliched, pandering, and trite attempt at "anarchy"; spearheaded by lots of cheesy intimations to "the man" and rampant overuse of the term "fascists". A complete crapfest.
