When I saw the film in 1993, I was like, "Wow! What a wonderful film!" The film itself is somewhat boring at spots, but all in all the films eliminates that through a good story and good acting.<br /><br />Kate Maberly who starred as, "Mary" in the film is absolutely magnificent. I am wondering why I don't see her in many other films. Maggie Smith who was also in the film, of course brings a dramatic performance. I wasn't expecting anything less from her.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the film and everyone should at least see it once.<br /><br />I don't know how they did it, but the film has alot of drama, however, it doesn't get too mushy. Not at all!<br /><br />Get something to eat, and sit back and enjoy this cinematic masterpiece.
