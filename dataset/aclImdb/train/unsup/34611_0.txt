This DVD is on the TV now. Hired it for my kids.<br /><br />Watched the trailer first. I lie. I started to watch the film, found the first 5 minutes totally incomprehensible then decided to watch the trailer. Released "summer 2006" said the trailer. That set alarm bells ringing since it's only April 2007 now.<br /><br />I reckon this one went straight to DVD.<br /><br />The sound level at the beginning of the film was overly loud. I figured out why after a while. It's because the sound engineer had screwed up and you couldn't hear any of the pathetic dialogue, so they'd just upped the volume in general to try to get round it.<br /><br />It is terrible; like an amateur movie. The accents and pronunciation are lousy (worst British accents I have ever heard) and the acting is simply appalling.<br /><br />I couldn't believe this film was made in 2006 - it seems much older because the general quality of the film is so poor. Honestly, save yourself the bother and don't bother hiring this film for your children, buying the DVD as a gift or watching it on TV. I think this is one of those films that went straight to DVD.<br /><br />Yup, the worst movie I have ever seen. We are about to turn it off.
