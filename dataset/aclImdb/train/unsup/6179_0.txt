When I was growing up in the 60's I used to go matin√©es and watch Hercules and even the later TV series with Kevin Sorbo as Hercules.I read that Hercules is the son of Zeus and as the years passed into my later 40's I finally grew to accept there is only one God.The one who counts and God made it clear in His 1st Commandment Thou Shalt Not Have No Other gods Before Me.Zeus is a (false god) I used to think the Hercules films and TV show and even the cartoon were great,But after God wrote His Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai which I call The Capitol Of God's World was all I needed to know God is the only God,all other gods and goddesses are false and they go against God's 1st Commandment.So it was written by My Father.
