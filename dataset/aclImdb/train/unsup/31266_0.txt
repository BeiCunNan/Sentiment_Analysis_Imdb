This is a straight, nonsensical comedy starring 2, or should 3 (Nancy) actors I have never witnessed before. On the same vein as "Dumb and Dumber" and "There's something about Mary" (the Farrelly brothers), I found this movie to be a humorous "Fight Club". In fact, I liked a lot more how the conflict of multiple personalities is handled on this movie; the ending, actually, made a bit more sense (though it would be a toss-up to say this film is better than Fight Club).<br /><br />The film-making tandem of Tom Kennedy & Alex Harz, seem to have the potential to be the next Farrelly brothers or Trey Parker and Matt Stone: aiming for the limit of what audiences might stand in front of a screen. Be sure to watch this film with your best friends, and get ready to laugh yourself silly over this one. It's a good one!
