Yet another limp, pointless straight-to-video T&A soft-core opus masquerading as horror - why don't these people just do Penthouse videos or something... In which a handsome young priest who collects horror movie trinkets finds his young, busty blonde friend stripping in a seedy club run by a cache of amateur vampire vixens who can't keep their miracle bras on. Features bad sound, uninspired directing, very amateurish acting, and some pretty dopey "original" songs. You can howl to such loopy dialogue as "This dude is food!", and other such tidbits. Not as bad as others in the Tasteless Horror/T&A genre - such as Cannibal Hookers"; nonetheless, Vamps: Deadly Dreamgirls cud only be enjoyed by pimply-faced 14 year-old guys. You know yer in for it when the main character ( the priest), which whom we are supposed to empathize with, not only collects trivial horror film memorabilia, but also porn mags and frequents strip clubs. Tacky, unoriginal, and simply bad. MooCow says these Vamps are tramps. :=8P
