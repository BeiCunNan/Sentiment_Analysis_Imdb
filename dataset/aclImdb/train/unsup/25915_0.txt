This show has so many things we have all been waiting so long for, but most of all, it has gut busting comedy. I found myself constantly cracking up each time i watch this. Its like I have already connected with the characters, which are all funny. <br /><br />The episodes so far have been hilarious, smart, and well acted. After watching 10 minutes of this you will find yourself wanting to work at a supermarket. You cant like this show, you love it. I pretty much have no idea what the characters names are but I know their personalities. Probably more than I should. do yourself a favor and glue yourself to your TV and tivo watching 10 items or less.
