Not surprisingly, when you put an all-midget cast in a "B" western, you get a "B" western starring midgets. There is a novelty appeal, which tapers off during the running time. It's like watching the "Little Rascals" all grown up (and guzzling beer). More lasting is watching the cast humorously maneuver around the not-so-tiny "Tiny Town". Although built smaller scale to make average western stars look bigger, the town is still way too big for little people. Handsome Billy Curtis (as Buck Lawson) makes a fine hero. He and pretty Yvonne Moray (as Nancy Preston) are a cute couple. Dastardly "Little Billy'" Rhodes puts up a good fight. Nita Krebs plays a sultry saloon singer, and Charles Becker amusingly tosses his cook's cap into the pot. Still, it's a cheap production.<br /><br />**** The Terror of Tiny Town (12/1/38) Sam Newfield ~ Billy Curtis, Yvonne Moray, 'Little Billy' Rhodes
