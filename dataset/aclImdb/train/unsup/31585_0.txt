I liked ''Hide and Seek''a lot! It's the first horror/Thriller movie I watched with Robert De Niro, and he is great in his role of David Callaway! Dakota Fanning is one of my favorite child actors, and she is also awesome in the role of little Emily, not only because of her acting skills, but also because of her new look, with long and dark hair who really suits her. (Much better then the natural blonde hair she has, in my opinion). I don't want to write too much about the story of this movie, because I guess it could ruin the movie. I only can say that I liked the ending of this film VERY MUCH, and it's very surprising and dark in some way, what makes it great.<br /><br />Famke Janssen is beautiful as always by the way! =)
