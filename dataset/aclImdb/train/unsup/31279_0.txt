I own 'Wedding Crashers', '40 Year Old Virgin' and the 'Aristocrats', all of which I think are funnier than watching clowns box blindfolded in a vat of hydrochloric acid, but I must say, '?' definitely falls within this riotous collection of humor.<br /><br />Though not loaded with "current" household names, '?' is as funny, off-the-wall and entertaining as its bigger budget counterparts listed above.<br /><br />I can't get over the reality scenes, the adoring personalities of the film; 'Nancy' the blowup doll; 'Art' the retard; 'West' the twisted f**ck, and the overall feel + story which makes you laugh till you urinate yourself, and then cry like a kid getting his teeth pulled.<br /><br />'?' is a must see/own film, which falls into the realm of cult-classic!
