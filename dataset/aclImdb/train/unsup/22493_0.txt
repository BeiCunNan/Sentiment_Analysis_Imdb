A man who witnesses his brother plowing his wife, takes him out driving in order to kill him, with the help of some random psycho wearing only a loincloth, whom the cuckolded brother then kills off. But the psycho rises from the grave to kill him. My god this film was atrocious on every level. I think it might have been going for aventgarde, but failed miserably.Even at little over an hour, the movie still succumbs to massive repetition. I consider it to be among the worst zombie film that I've ever seen and trust me if you've read my other reviews you'll know I'm not prone to mindless hyperbole. So trust me and stay away from this waste of celluloid.<br /><br />My Grade: F
