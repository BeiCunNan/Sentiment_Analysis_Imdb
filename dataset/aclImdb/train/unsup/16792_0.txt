Lorenzo Lamas returns in his last go around as Soldier, this time the renegade cop takes on a gang of bikers who have caused trouble for suburban families. This time he's aided by Minor Mustain nicknamed "The Cowboy" This one is easily the weakest of the series, only because there isn't enough of the crazy ridiculousness of parts # 1 and 2. There are some shootouts but these are generally one sided and the bikers provide lame fodder for the vigilante and his Cowboy partner. Although the film starts of blissfully stupid enough, with Lorenzo Lamas pretending to be a robber, while another guy robs some place. (I think it was a store) Of course this then gives way to a moronic story with bikers doing things that only the wimpiest bikers do. Indeed if you want a good biker flick, check out Stone Cold for sheer fun ridiculousness. Snake Eater III:His Law is a sub par effort which is as terrible as what you would come to expect from Lorenzo Lamas.<br /><br />*1/2 out of 4-(Poor)
