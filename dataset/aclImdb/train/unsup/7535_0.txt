I saw this film, I expected a lot and it didn't deliver. It's that simple. It's boring, and over the top performance-wise. The actors are all pretty good....in OTHER movies. The rest of these reviews on this site smell like typical plants to me. So be very careful before paying any money to go see it. Although, once it's on video, it might be worth a look. If it ever gets there. I've read other comments that said it has been passed over for any kind of distribution and when I was at the screening the producers said that it was rejected by every festival. Bad sign for an independent film. But it makes my point for me. My 2 cents.
