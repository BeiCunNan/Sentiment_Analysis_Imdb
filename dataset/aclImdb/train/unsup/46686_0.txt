The worst movie I've seen this year and probably the worst I will see for some time. It was that bad that of the 12 people watching, 6 left. Unfortunately I was not one of them as I waited for the "twist you never see coming". I was that embarrassed that I'd actually paid money to watch it that I found myself ducking out of the cinema like some unscrupulous pick pocket making off with his ill gotten gains. I avoided eye contact with the other four poor unfortunates, who probably felt as robbed as we did, for fear of seeing disappointment and disbelief in their eyes that echoed my own. Avoid like the plague. I don't want anyone to feel conned, like we did. I felt like jumping the counter to snatch back my ten pounds and would have done but for the fear of having to explain to my fellow inmates that I was in for watching "Right at my door" or whatever its called. You have been warned!!
