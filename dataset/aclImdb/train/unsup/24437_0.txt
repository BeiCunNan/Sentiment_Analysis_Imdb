Uma Thurman is extraordinary as a club girl looking for a Mr. Right -- *any* Mr. Right (or even Mr. Okay For Now). She debases herself awkwardly and willingly in repeated pathetic attempts to get guys to like her, and they smell her desperation a mile away. She shyly volunteers that she gives good head, for instance, and her offer is accepted repeatedly, while between encounters she's got the stink of something best left outside -- and so she is. Her need for acceptance appears driven by a deeper need for respect, for the recognition that she is worthy of more than service as a convenient warm body. It's a heart wrenching performance, and one that I recognized to the core of me from my own club days, during the times of my life when I was so lonely that I couldn't even *fake* self-respect convincingly.<br /><br />I was torn between wanting to shake her and wanting to hold her. Her role strikes a bullseye for anyone who has ever needed a kind word and received only derision.
