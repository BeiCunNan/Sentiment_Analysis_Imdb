How Come Replacement Actress Can Be Look Like Prostitute ? First Movie, Julia Stiles barely wears make-up, and straight short hair.<br /><br />then when with this movie's opening scene, the girl came out with Wig & heavy make-up with horrible eye-shadows !!! it's one of worst thing, you don't wanna see on sequel, that changes not just the character, the look !!! not just the look, the whole package !!! beside watching lovely, also a little bit uncomfortable looking Luke Mably. this movie just screws, reputation of first movie.<br /><br />Besides horrible acting and plot. music is unbelievably not suiting with each scenes.<br /><br />and since when all this drama's story based on power game and politics ? or just trying to copy version of "what a girl wants" ?
