As far back as I can remember, my sisters and I have been fascinated with this film. I guess that would be my whole life since I was born in 81! We had a tape of Sea Prince and the Fire Child and it was watched so often that it started to deteriorate. My father would get mad because we didnt care if we ruined the vrc as long as we could watch our movie. I wish I could find another copy of it as ours went 'mysteriously missing'! My favourite character would have to be Bibble. If i remember correctly thats his name. But the summary says the fire child's name is Marta! I guess the way Sirius always said it made us confused because we called her Malta. But really, this is one of the best memories of my childhood. If anyone knows where I can get a tape, let me know!
