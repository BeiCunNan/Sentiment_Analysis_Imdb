The second improves greatly upon the animation standards. Although the drawing is done to geometric accuracy, too much CGI is used and looks weird at many places. It in fact, does not even look as good at the GITS movie. Technically speaking, the GITS series may be the best animated in the world but as far as the final perspective is concerned, it certainly does not look that or look that realistic or deep. It sometimes looks quite bland and more like computer rendering meaning that the CGI is way too obvious. Those flaws have been fixed to certain extents in the 2nd Gig which also pays homage to the original movie through certain scenes which should look familiar. The new intro is not great though.
