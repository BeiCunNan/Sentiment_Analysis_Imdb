Two nudnicks (Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd) think they're being trained as spies for the United States government when actually they're being used as guinea pigs against the Russian defense. Fans of TV's "Saturday Night Live" may never have guessed that one-time rivals Chase and Aykroyd would end up starring in a picture together, or that "Blues Brothers" filmmaker John Landis would be directing, however they may be the only audience for this type of slapstick silliness. The script is threadbare, and Landis relies heavily on hammy gags and scenery-chewing. Shapely Donna Dixon (Mrs. Aykroyd) has a funny, sexy bit, but Steve Forrest and Bruce Davison get trampled in the sloppy action. Hopelessly out-of-touch star vehicle. * from ****
