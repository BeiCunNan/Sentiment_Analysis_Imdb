What a ridiculous film! This movie is so bad I can't believe I was daring enough to see it until the end! But it was hard! Do you know when you start watching a movie and in the first 4/5 minutes you start asking yourself: "why doesn't it end right now?" Yes that's right, this film "stunk" from the very first minute <br /><br />The psycho character is ridiculous! I mean, what stupid clown suit is that? <br /><br />The plot is pathetic! One of the silliest I've seen the last times! <br /><br />The acting is bad! I know it's a B-series movie (or is it a Z-series one instead?) but the acting could be much better. <br /><br />The "special effects" are lame. I know it was a low cost production, but even so! <br /><br />The all main idea of using a clown and the "fast-food setting" is absurd, ridiculousIf it's supposed to be funny or spoofing it just spoofs itself! <br /><br />Fast food doesn't kill but this film does.of boredom!
