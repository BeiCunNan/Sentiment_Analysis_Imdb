Friday the 13th, number ??? Do we really need to count them anymore? In this flick we have obnoxious, drunken, dope-smoking, 20-somethings that have their karma leveled by a hockey-masked super-killer named Jason. As in previous renditions, there are a couple of sympathetic characters added for audience appeal while Jason murders the other repulsive young twits one by one. There is much discussion in these pages about the lack of originality in this movie, but the fact is there is little originality in the entire Friday 13 series. The first Friday the 13th., 1980, was just an American re-hash of horror master Mario Bava's Bay of Blood, 1971. Fortunately, Mr. Bava had the good sense to quit after one entry; that good judgment is missing from the American side which merely sees the opportunity to squeeze a little more cash out of a dated idea. Only for hard core fans of machete-massacre movies.
