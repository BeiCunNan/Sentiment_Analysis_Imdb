It's cheesy good fun in this blissfully goofy Italian romp 'starring' the amazingly untalented younger brother of Sean Connery, Neil. I love the fact that in this spy film they refer to his brother as the greatest agent of Britain, but they're referring to Sean Connery, not James Bond! That's because they couldn't get the rights to use the Bond name in the film, although Sean seems to have been amenable to his own name used. Probably thought it was a good joke.<br /><br />Neil's a plastic surgeon, of all things, who gets drawn into a spy caper because of his work with hypnosis. One of his patients apparently knows too much, and so is kidnapped by the (almost exclusively female) agents of an organization called THANATOS. Also starring in this amusing pastiche is the fleshy guy who played in Diabolik as the crime lord who utters the memorable words:"Is that Stud, coming?" while on his boat. he plays another fleshy crime lord in this one, and the most unappealing part of this film is watching the beautiful young women who surround him on his yacht(a yacht again? What's with this guy!) massage him and wait in him hand and foot.<br /><br />The theme song is a hoot, proving once again that Morricone is the King of Corny. The addled plot line never quite comes up to scratch, but that's o.k. The real reason for the movie is displayed about three quarters of the way through, when the stunning boat babes get into a wrestling match/fight with the male sailors on board the yacht. The movie just goes to show you that a movie is all about the details-which this one manages to get all wrong, but in such a way as to leave you gasping with laughter. Thank God for cheap Italian films, which have provided us with so much mirth over the years. Oh, and Clint Eastwood, of course.
