which was made in 1931 with Adolphe Menjou and Pat O'Brien. Or better yet, watch His Girl Friday, which was filmed in 1940 with Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell (with Hildy Johnson recast as a female reporter). This 1974 version feels leaden and uninspired by comparison. Why remake a movie that has already been done beautifully--twice? Billy Wilder should have known better than to try.
