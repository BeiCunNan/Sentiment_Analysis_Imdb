This is a funny, funny story about a gay couple pretending to be a straight couple to impress the family of the son's fianc√©e. There are moral lessons in this comedy to live and let live and to judge people on their character, not their sexual orientation.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I watched this movie together and we both howled with laughter. We still treasure this movie and watch it again and again.<br /><br />We had not seen either the original play or movie so this was a standalone viewing. It was just terrific.<br /><br />Williams and Lane are perfect as the gay couple. The look on Williams' face when Lane comes into the house when the visitors are there is priceless. Williams is a great straight guy (pun intended) for Lane's antics.<br /><br />I judge this movie on the amount of laughs it gave me and that has to be a "10." Gene Hackman is perfect, as usual, as a moralizing, hypocritical Senator.
