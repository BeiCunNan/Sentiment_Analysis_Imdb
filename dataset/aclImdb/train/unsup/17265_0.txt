Are 5th graders sensitive? Do they have worries, doubts and hopes? Do they at least think? SURE THEY DO! This movie takes a peek about a boy´s opinion on life, about what makes it all happen. Have you ever asked yourself those questions? - Thankfully this film (because it is more than a movie, it is a film) doesn´t fall in the trap of easy joking and unnecessary plots. It is simply a well told story (not to mention who´s behind the camera), with a lot of heart in it. I´d definitely recommend it, not just for a rainy afternoon, but for your whole life. - P.S.: You can tell some things about the movie´s creator just by watching it.
