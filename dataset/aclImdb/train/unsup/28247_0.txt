I never read or watched the original Astro Boy but I hope its better than this astrological unlikeable and generic CGI movie. Overall, the movie felt forced: so much happens in this hour and a half movie that there is no time to develop anything or even the hundreds of moral themes the movie throws at the audience (law of robotics, being human, finding where you belong).<br /><br />Oddly enough, the movie has a weird good guy/bad guy bipolar disorder where characters turn from being a good guy to a bad guy back to a good guy in a matter of minutes. Case in point: the second act builds heavily on Ham Egg being portrayed as a replacement fatherly figure and an all around good guy but all of a sudden, he turns on Astro Boy with no justification since his introduction. <br /><br />Animation wise, I thought the movie had no real distinct style and it felt like I was watching Robots but I found it odd that character design of Astro Boy looked completely different from all the other characters. He still had the anime look with big eyes yet the other characters looked like generic cgi characters. <br /><br />It's a shame because I wanted this movie to be better. In the end, Astro Boy is completely forgettable.
