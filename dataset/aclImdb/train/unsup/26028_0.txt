This heading was a joke. Slater is invisible in most of the film, and I doubt it is he who performs the invisible stunts where people are ridiculously thrown about and killed all through the movie. It is a shame that sequels only follow up the horror and the violence, the first movie was quite interesting at least during the first half, with impressive special effects on Kevin Bacon and the gorilla. The same fate befell "Final Destination" where the first movie raised lot of interesting philosophical questions, and the sequels were crap.<br /><br />The best indicator for this film is the small number of people who have bothered to watch it and/or give their vote. Always a pleasure to watch Facinelly, though, although he could choose better films to participate in.
