ok, let's start with the premise. Twin body builders, baby-sitting twin spoiled brats. Still wanna see it? You might like to know that 3 others sets of twins join up with the body builders to fight a terrorist/business/oil giant/whatever. i counted 5 sets of twins in all, how many can you spot?<br /><br />more seriously now, this is truly one of the worst films ever.1/2*
