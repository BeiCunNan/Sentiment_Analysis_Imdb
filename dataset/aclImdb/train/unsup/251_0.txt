It is said that any true art allows the viewer to interpret it in his or hew own way. There is no right or wrong interpretation. What I found most compelling about Last Call were the following 2 things: That like Henry James' The Turn of the Screw you are not really sure if this is all actually happening, all taking place in a single mind or as part of a collective consciousness among the people in the bar/home. And, the exploration of all forms of desire among a group of "not so young" patrons. The concept that even at this age, people can still maintain, grow and explore all forms of sensuality and sexuality is very appealing - kind of makes me feel that there is sex after 50! Clearly the actors were treated so well and with much love - it comes through in the film.
