I didn't like this movie. I read the reviews, watched it, and came away thinking that if this was a movie about a male teacher who "loved" a female student or a female teacher who "loved" a male student that people wouldn't be so sympathetic. In a nutshell, this teacher had no right to be sleeping with a young girl... even if the young girl was the one who initiated the contact. I've also known quite a lot of religious in my life (both priests and nuns) and never knew one who was quite as creepy as "Mother Immaculata" from this film. Her own relationship with Simone was odd. The fact that Simone repeatedly asked to have Annabelle moved out of her dorm and had her comments ignored without discussion was strange. I think the only scene that moved me was when Simone was in church speaking to the priest. When he said his problem was that he "knew everything" I really felt that he was trying to tell her that he knew she was a lesbian and didn't condemn her for it. And I found that simple handclasp at the end of the scene very comforting.
