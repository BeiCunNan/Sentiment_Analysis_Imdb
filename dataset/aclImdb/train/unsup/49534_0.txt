LIE DOWN WITH DOGS was reasonably popular with gay audiences for about fifteen minutes in 1995, but God only knows why. A more abrasive set of overworked stereotypes can scarcely be imagined.<br /><br />Tommy (Wally White) arrives in Provincetown with no money, no job, no place to stay, and grandiose ideas of the good times to be had at a gay-popular summer destination. Needless to say, one misadventure follows another: lecherous would-be employers, pot-smoking landlords, a snaky Latin lover more interested in Tommy's cigarettes than in Tommy himself. But the film is a great deal less interesting than it sounds.<br /><br />In theory, LIE DOWN WITH DOGS satirizes the youthful gay party scene. In practice, however, it plays out in the manner of a particularly charmless Saturday morning cartoon. Written and directed by Wally White himself, the film seems to exist chiefly in order to showcase just how relentlessly unfunny and aggressively obnoxious White can be.<br /><br />Now and then an occasional supporting player, a script idea, or a line of dialogue sparks the film to life--but such moments are too few and too far between to jolt this dog to life. Give it a miss.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
