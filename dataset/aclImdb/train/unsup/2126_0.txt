I absolutely LOVED this movie from beginning to end. I have NEVER been to a movie that "grabbed" me like this one did. The scene with the burning bush....there is no words for it. When I first saw it (and every time since), you could literally FEEL the presence of God in the theater. Plus, the music is totally AWESOME!! I mean, you have Mariah Carey & Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men, Take 6, BeBe & CeCe Winans, Steven Curtis Chapman, Alabama, Randy Travis and Linda Davis, Toby Keith, Charlie Daniels, Clint Black, Carman, plus an all-star song of which the actors and artists sing together. I highly recommend this movie and music to everyone!
