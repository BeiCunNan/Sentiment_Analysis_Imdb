Well I thought this game was amazing in every detail except for the revival system, I don't like it how before you can get any waters of life you have to go to a priest and revive or remove poison or curses. But all in all the game was very amazing. The Battle system I thought was flawless and I loved the Djinni\Summon system it was genius. I didn't like the fact that it was so short it took me two days to beat and the final boss was the easiest battle in the game with the exception of the beginning random battles.I also want to know how they are going to start golden sun 2 (which should be coming out Christmas 2002 for all you golden sun fans)because if it's a different game pack than golden sun will they start with the average level of the game then factor in everything like spells and Items and then maybe start the game on the boat then have a secret closet where you can pick up any of the weapons you may have had. Also I thi\ought they would have the ending before the credits that was a little different but what can I do. Oh and another Idea I have about the continuation of the game is maybe they should make a special device that they they sell in the same box as golden sun 2 to transfer the data of your game ongolden sun then save it to golden sun 2(hint hint people who made the game)and then maybe sell it for 100 bucks and you'd make more money hey that works hunh. Oh well it was an amazing game with hard puzzles but still the best game I've played for GBA so if you don't have this game BUY IT!!!!!!!!! you'll like it if you like games like the final fantasy series and chrono cross and you might buy the game then try those games listed abvove and love them. Bye
