Phobias fascinate me. Great movie, very nice. I love it. The ending is such a twist you'll never guess it. <br /><br />Turn back now or know the ending: When the killer is e-mailing, calling,in the house,killing people, all that? He runs outside to save his mother from the killer and fights with the killer until he realizes it was all a big vivid hallucination!!! No one ever died that day his mom went to work late! He takes flowers to his sister's grave and gets back with his girlfriend, no longer an agoraphobic. The killer was in police custody the whole time, like the news said. I love this movie. If you decided to read this far, you still might want to watch to see how severe a phobia can be, and an extreme example of how love for a family member can possibly cure it. Joey would've died for his mother, and this movie touched me deeply.
