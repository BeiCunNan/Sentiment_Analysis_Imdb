From the first episode, to the last. In my opinion this is the best program to ever grace the television screen.<br /><br />Its by far the funniest comedy, and certainly the best sci-fi comedy. The Americans try to emulate but fail miserably.<br /><br />I don't understand the haters of series 7 and 8, there are some fantastic episodes, who doesn't like ace rimmer ? - And Krytie TV is a scream.<br /><br />The show didn't go down hill from series 6, they just added the gorgeous kochanski, which may not have replaced rimmer but she certainly added something to the show.<br /><br />I'm in two minds about the film, part of me really wants to see more, but the other part doesn't want to see an "american-ised" super special effects film which just isn't red dwarf. It looks like its been cancelled, and the chance of another series has the same odds of me stitching a pair of lemon maternity slacks.<br /><br />Well it certainly is "cold outside" as i type this, so I'll say....<br /><br />"Stoke me a klipper, I'll be back for Christmas!"
