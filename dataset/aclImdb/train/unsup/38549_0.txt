You would think that a sequel to a half-decent horror flick starring Punky Brewster and Bill Clinton's little brother would be at least bearable, but this proves just how awful a movie can really be. The creature looks more fake than he did in the original, Lance Henriksen isn't in the cast this time and there isn't even any decent breast shots of Soleil Moon-Frye. A waste of time and (dare I say) talent.
