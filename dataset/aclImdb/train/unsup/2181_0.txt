I can honestly say that I think "Rabid Grannies" is possibly, singularly, the worst film I have ever had the chance to watch. The acting is the equivalent of a 6 year old at the very best. Its hard to see any rational reason this film ever got funding let alone anyone decided to actual make it. The story line has been replicated, to much better standards, at least a thousand times before the directors of this film were even born. The only comedy side to this film is that when the killing starts the people act as though its nothing out of the ordinary. It appears these actors regularly have zombies running around their living room. Please please please avoid this film at all costs and if you can't, try to go to sleep! I am disgusted that this film managed to get 90 Min's of my life!
