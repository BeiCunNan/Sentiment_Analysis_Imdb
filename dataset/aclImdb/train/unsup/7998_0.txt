I really enjoyed this film. Eric Weber is a talented writer/director. I would like to see more from him. I thought the acting was very good especially the son. Joey Pants was perfect for the lead. He captured the role and had me believing that he was a troubled soul. Boyd Gaines was also great as the friend/nemesis. We all have people like this in our lives, some one who has "made it" while we wait for the big breaks. It was neat as well to see Polly Draper (big 30 Something fan). She should do more features. As for Eric Weber, I believe that this film bests "Suits" and his ability to tell a good story well should ensure him continued years of writing, directing and producing. Let's get this thing into the theaters across the country already!
