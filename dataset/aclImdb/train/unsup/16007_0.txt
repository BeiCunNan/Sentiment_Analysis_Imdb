This might be the worst Scorsese film I have ever seen. I have a feeling that because this might be one of his least accessible films to current audiences, people just call it his most 'underrated'. In fact, there's a reason it isn't talked about much, because it is rubbish. Here Scorsese seems like he's built up his reputation strongly enough so he can just put out any old tosh and audiences will praise it to high heaven just because Scorsese directed it. The directing is lazy, the plot at first glance seems interesting enough but Scorsese does his best to bring it down and ends up with a stretched, repetitive, sequence of encounters with various deadbeats, and lowlife losers, which we are apparently supposed to show some interest in. Griffin Dunne is just to waspy and bland for us to invest any time in caring for his character. The film just doesn't stop attempting to prepare us for tension and excitement and building up these encounters and situations before resulting in a huge anti-climax and more stretched out, aimless roads to nowhere.
