This movie isn't bad, but I wasn't impressed either. The usual flashback way of telling the story is slightly changed here: one character tells us what happened, the second one confirms the situations, but puts them in different context, giving them different meaning, and some crucial moments are told completely opposite. As the movie continues it becomes a bit boring, there are no real changes, plot is straight, clear and predictable: whole movie is built on only one question: whose version is a true one? And, unfortunately, the final answer isn't surprising...<br /><br />This movie is an average, watchable and very forgettable story when you have nothing wiser to do. Zal was disappointing (so promising actress in her early movies like Testament or Amelia, I hoped she'll become something like Mare Winningham, but this movie maybe didn't give her enough opportunity), Perry was better in flashback scenes and quite inconceivable when dealing with her wife's death and being a suspect for her murder, Greene had too small part and I wonder how low can she fall, while Benzali was the only reason one could enjoy in this movie.<br /><br />If it was written by Raymond Chandler it could be a masterpiece, and Hitchcock had made some great movies with even worse script. But, there was only one Chandler and only one Hitch - so sometimes we have to be satisfied with movies like this.
