After seeing all the hype from TV promos I Watched this TV film today. Other reviewer have rated it one (1) star - surprisingly, one rater thought it was an "oscar worthy movie". I don't know what that rater watched, nor do I understand how he arrived at his posted rating - which IS more than a little high. What I watched was a film that was full of bad writing, Wooden acting and an uninspired story. Then there is the so-so FX which help make watching this movie a waste of 2 hours. Guess I hoped for more than was shown, pity; thought this may have had promise, maybe even a plausible story. What I saw was a movie that is food for termites.
