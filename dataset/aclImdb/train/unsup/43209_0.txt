This has to be one of the oddest films ever highlighted on MST3K. Starting with a baffling opening - note that the poachers see strange lights while the asteroid/egg chamber is still in outer space - and ending on a depressing note (most of the interesting characters are dead and poor Trumpy will inevitably follow them), Pod People provides two hours of... well, pain.<br /><br />To me, the high point of the film is that extremely weird scene where Trumpy exhibits his magic powers of telekinesis, toy animation and extreme goofiness. "Wow, Trumpy, you can do stupid things!" indeed.<br /><br />(As a postscript, one wonders why a previous reviewer used the Official MST3K Episode Guide's summary of the film verbatim.)
