"Toxic Zombies" is one horrible zombie movie! With an uncountable number of faults, I would rank this movie within the top ten worst films I've ever seen. This movie would provide a great example of a bad movie that came out of the early eighties zombie era.<br /><br />The "plot", which is virtually non-existent, is as follows: A group of people are growing marijuana on a piece of land that is owned by the government. When the government hears about this, they drop a load of extremely toxic chemicals on both the marijuana and the people (the government apparently did not care about the condition of the people). These chemicals end up turning the group people into zombies, hence the name "Toxic Zombies". The rest of the movie involves zombies killing and eating people.<br /><br />The plot may not sound that bad to some, but what the director did with it is what made the movie so bad. There is not a large amount of gore, unlike what the box lead me to believe, and when gore is inserted, it is extremely fake. The acting is very bad, as is the dialogue and the plot. The only good thing about this movie is the unintentional humor derived from the script and the bad acting.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for nobody. My rating: 2 out of 10
