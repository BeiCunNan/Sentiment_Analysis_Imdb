This bitchy, strident (modern and very nasty) "romantic comedy" is a real disappointment. I was rather surprised that nothing works well in this mess of a movie. The cast is good and the script is by the acclaimed writer Jay Presson Allen (based on her novel), but director Lumet fails to align all the dots. The story deals with the NY upper class, a place that I'm sure Lumet knows well. However, he cannot make up his mind if this was meant to be a social satire, a black comedy, or a serious drama. The tone of the films keeps changing from scene to scene. As I said before, I liked the cast (Alan King is really good in his best movie role), but this is one of those movies with high aspirations and little common sense. Plus all characters are very obnoxious. Not even Oswald Morris' glossy cinematography can save this one.
