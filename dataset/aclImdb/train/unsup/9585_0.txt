This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is romantic an absolute non-icky way, it shows a humans kindness in whole new lighting and Nino and Amelie share this delicate, tender, gentle love without many words said. Jean-Pierre made this film colorful like only few other people did or could do. Paris looks absolute dreamy and it makes you wish you were born in Paris, in Montmartre, with french as your mother tongue. It makes you wanna do something beautiful with your life, to yourself and to others, of course. It makes you brave, although you think of yourself to be the worst coward ever to live on this planet. Acting is perfect and I still can't get over the fact it didn't win an Oscar for best foreign film. Music goes along with the movie just great, it just right, it sets the perfect mood for the viewer. I really recommend this movie to everyone because I can guarantee you won't be disappointed!!!
