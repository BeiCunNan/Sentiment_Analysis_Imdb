What bugs me is how people are talking about how funny this is, and its just encouraging the producers and film companies to continue making garbage like this (i.e. the Scary Movie franchise with its 'Epic' & 'Date' movie spin-offs.) I went to this movie not expecting a whole lot, and same with my buddy. Its not so much that I cant get my money back for my ticket, its that I cant get the 1h 45 minutes back that was wasted from my life.<br /><br />This movie was and is easily the worst movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />*And its sad that not even the great Chris Walken could save a disaster like this.<br /><br />If any of you are contemplating and seeing this, I strongly suggest you to not waste your time. Im not one take in the perspective of other peoples opinions, but please... trust me on this one... I have seen a lot of movies, and this one isn't even worth downloading.
