I wonder if Zemeckis was attempting to preach to us about tampering with nature or for that matter, your outer body. Perhaps he was warning Hollywood about the danger in beauty plastic surgery that is getting out of hand. Maybe we should just blame the script writers for being very unfunny. The only advantage in watching this on broadcast TV is that the commercials were more interesting. But I liked the end party scene with Elvis and James Dean.
