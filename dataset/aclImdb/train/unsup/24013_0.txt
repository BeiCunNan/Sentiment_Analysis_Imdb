This is a fascinating political documentary that focuses on the 2004 electoral campaign, in which one wealthy patrician convinced the electorate that he would be more fun to drink a beer with than the other wealthy patrician. The most revealing parts, however, come towards the end of the film, when we see massively long lines of African-American voters waiting to cast their ballot whilst Anglo voters waltz into the polling place and vote within seconds. There's also an intriguing clip that passes without comment: a group of white college students wielding Bush-Cheney signs chant 'O.J. was guilty' at a group of black college students. Nothing could sum up the unspoken truth about American 'race relations' and the national predominance of the Republican Party better than this fleeting scene.
