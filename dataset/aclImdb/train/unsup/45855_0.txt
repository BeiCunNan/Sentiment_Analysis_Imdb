I must say, i was quite disappointed with this one, as versus was sooooo great. This one is justlike a coffee , brewed up a second or third time, and it tastes bad.....i prefer to watch the original versus 100 times than this crap. the whole movie bored the hell out of me, while versus was so great and crazy, loaded with anticipation for whats to come in the next second all the way through, this is just lame....sorry, i cant tell you to go see this in the cinema or even rent the DVD, i really cant. ........... ........ ........... ...................... xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx<br /><br />awful awful awful
