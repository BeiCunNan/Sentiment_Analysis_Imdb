The reason why Marvel can't get a decent box-office hit is because they don't have a big motion picture corporation backing them like DC does (DC is owned by Warner Brothers). Even though Men in Black was a success, Marvel has had more hits than misses: The Spider Man TV movies, The Punisher (a guilty pleasure of mine to watch), and The Fantasic Four (I remember E! making a big deal about it, but I never saw it in the theatres or the video stores). Captain America is also another Marvel movie miss. Talent like Matt Salenger, Ronny Cox, Ned Beatty, Bill "Don't call me Billy" Mumy, and Darren McGavin are wasted in this 97 minute disaster. You don't get to learn much of the characters and the storyline is bouncing all over the place. Kim Gillingham shows promise as she plays a duel role as Cappy's girlfriend back in the 40's, and his girlfriend's daughter in the 90's. There is some songs by Southside Johnny and one of the Neville brothers on the soundtrack for what it's worth. Still, this looks like a thrown together production of a super hero film that deserved better treatment. What a tragedy.
