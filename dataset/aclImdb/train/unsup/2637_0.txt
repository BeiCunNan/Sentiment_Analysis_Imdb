The only show that we definitely make it a point not to miss right now is Meerkat Manor. It is super! I am also glad that they have begun to rerun it occasionally on Sunday nights, so that when we do miss a show, we can catch up. (It is also fun to watch them all over again.)<br /><br />I am normally reluctant to watch animal shows as bad things always seem to happen to the animals. The Whiskers family does experience some tragic moments, to be sure, but these are infrequent and watching the family dynamics is fascinating. You get lots of drama and comedy, and all of the actors are incredibly cute. You really do get caught up in it - I am sure that Yosarian's moving the pups episode had a lot of viewers yelling at the screen.<br /><br />It is so nice to have a show to watch that isn't so drearily predictable - you never know what Flower, Mozart, Tosca and company will be up to or up against next. (I am really concerned about Tosca right now!) Too bad the reality shows involving people aren't half as entertaining as this.
