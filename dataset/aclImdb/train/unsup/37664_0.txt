I don't know why Gibson's work does not translate well to the screen, but this is another example of a bad medium translation. In the short story, there is tension through the entire work. The film seems to center on the voyeuristic side of the sex scenes being played out on screen. These scenes have little or nothing to do with the plot. The main characters wasted their considerable talent in this very forgettable movie.
