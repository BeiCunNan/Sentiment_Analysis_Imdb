Okay, I saw probably about 300 commercials on the Disney Channel for the movie DOUBLE TEAMED. I waited and waited, until I couldn't stand it anymore. I think it was the best Disney movie ever, Disney channel, or on a big screen at a theatre. This movie definetely deserved to be a real movie. The plot was great, the characterzations well developed, and everything else i forgot to mention was fabulous.<br /><br />***** out of *****
