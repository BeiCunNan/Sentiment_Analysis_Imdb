This movie is far from a masterpiece, but it's worth seeing. It's more of a satire than a fiction comedy, an extreme view of some of the less pleasant realities in today's Romania. <br /><br />It's really a pity that the best jokes are hard to understand by someone who doesn't speak Romanian and have never lived here. The way they surprise, highlight and exaggerate some sad but true facts in our current society reminds me of one of our best classical novelists: I.L.Caragiale. The differences come from the different moments in time, but the style and message are very similar, showing the worst of our society in today's style and way of thinking. <br /><br />Maybe in "Garcea si oltenii" some of the more trivial expressions could be avoided, it's clearly not a movie to view with your kids and some people got a bad impression because of that, but we should keep in mind that the whole idea of this movie is to illustrate and make fun of what really the current way of life and thinking is for far too many RomaniansÂ…<br /><br />It's a satire, not a documentary! It's black humor from start to finish and it's not a single scene that doesn't correspond to everyday events we see around here.<br /><br />Without any grate expectations regarding the quality of the settings or any cool special effects (it's a low budget movie), I say: see it, be amused, disgusted, revolted or upset about the jokes, but also be honest and think about how many of the situations they are making fun of are based on things happening to you, around you or to a significant number of people living in Romania today!
