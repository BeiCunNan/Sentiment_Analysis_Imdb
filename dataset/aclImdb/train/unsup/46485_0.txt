This movie can be described in a few words. The words that come to mind to describe it are as follows: awful, bad, lame, garbage and an insult to martial arts films everywhere and so forth. Where to begin ? lets start with Kristin Kreuk's acting...or lack thereof. Her performance is wooden and 2 dimensional as she conveys NO emotion from her character. Kristin Kreuk's performance in this film reminds people that a person should take acting lessons before doing a movie. If anything this film should of been killed off as its a waste of 90 minutes to watch it. I would give it a 0 for a rating but that would be generous as its not even worth that.<br /><br />It seems that Michael Clark Duncan and Robin Shou must be hard up for roles if they took this king of a stinker. Don't even bother watching this film as a rental folks, its not worth it and you will regret spending your hard earned $$$ on this garbage. This film should be a major contender for the Razzie Awards. No wonder it bombed at the box office.
