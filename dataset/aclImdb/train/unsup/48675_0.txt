Flat, forgettable parody of "Alien" about small spaceship crew who land on newly discovered planet, bring back a tiny blob of grape jelly that mutates into a one-eyed, humanoid grape jelly thing that sings "I want to eat your face" and then proceeds to show the crew that he means what he sings.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is not in the same vein as the "Naked Gun" / "Airplane!" brand of parody movie-making, where the verbal and visual gags are almost non-stop. This movie seems to be aiming to be just silly. The jokes just die most of the time, and despite the efforts of a cast (including Leslie Nielsen, now a veteran of this kind of thing) that tries hard, the material just doesn't work. Writer / director / songwriter / co-star Bruce Kimmel (who had previously worked with co-star Cindy Williams in 1976's "The First Nudie Musical") gives it just a little bit of curiosity value with a few musical numbers (his songs actually ARE kind of catchy), but the film is ultimately lacking in real wit and basically has no energy. The lack of a big budget is hilariously obvious.<br /><br />Despite Nielsen's presence, I actually thought that stalwart Brit thespian Patrick MacNee was the comic standout - he was amusingly loony. Gerrit Graham hams it up a lot as a sort of standard issue lewd, crude jerk character that you sometimes find in straight-faced films of this kind.<br /><br />I wouldn't go so far as to say that I hated this film - it's not crummy enough to provoke that strong an emotion, and after all, it IS supposed to be a no-brainer comedy, but I just didn't it find to be very entertaining. If you really want to watch Nielsen act goofy, watch "Airplane!" or "The Naked Gun" and you'll be better off.<br /><br />3/10
