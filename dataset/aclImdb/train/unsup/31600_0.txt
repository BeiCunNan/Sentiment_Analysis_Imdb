Stranded premiered on Lifetime last night. Erica Durance stars as Carina, a bride-to-be on a bachelorette vacation in the Caribbean just before her wedding. Her friends Regan (outstanding performance by Bree De Beau), Nicole (Michelle Jones), Isabel (Vane Millon) and another pretty girl accompany her for what is supposed to be a fun-filled week. The girls decide to travel to a smaller island for a day trip, but their boat does not return to pick them up as scheduled and they find themselves stranded on a deserted island. Unfortunately for the girls, this is just the beginning of what is certain to be a nightmare. Talented Ashley Totin also stars as Danielle, Carina's best friend and maid of honor. Carlos Ponce and sexy Jack Hartnett also stars. The actor in the role of Danielle's boss does a nice job (and is also very good looking). <br /><br />I enjoyed this movie so much. Total suspense for nearly the entire movie and a couple of twists to make it all the more better. All characters were beautiful, dressed well, and played their parts convincingly. Director Kern Knoweiser does an excellent job here. The Caribbean locations were stunning.
