not bad. entertaining but utterly useless in the means of converting anyone to any political view. kinda like the feeling of watching a scary movie, when a stranger is knocking on your door, don't let him in. it also tells a unlikely story of how a peaceful group turned rouge. things like that mostly starts from people inside getting desperate, not from a stranger. still it is quite entertaining. i am the sort of person who try to watch a movie and see what information is right and which is fictional, which is wrong by error and which is wrong by purpose and this movie is great in that matter. I've enjoyed it but it wont satisfy if you want to learn something. in that sense its rubbish.
