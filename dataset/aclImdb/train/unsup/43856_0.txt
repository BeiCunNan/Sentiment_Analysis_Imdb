I have watched all "24" episodes to date and have enjoyed them, however that being said let me continue with the reasons this show has overstayed is appeal and gone the route of The X-Files and similarly "thrown together for ad revenue" shows.<br /><br />It used to be fairly well matched to the running clock, yet now we are fed some completely unrealistic timelines, one of the several that annoyed me from ep01 last night was the 2 and a half minutes Jack had to steal a car, call into HQ, hotwire the car, drive somewhere (for arguments sake I'll say half a mile) park the car, find the right house, slip into the back yard, wait for the guard to come out, k.o. the guard, go inside the house, start a conversation with the target and let him know that in another 2 and a half minutes the house was going to be blown to pieces, lol Other completely unrealistic actions include doing complex computer operations in a mere few seconds, doing impossible computer operations in a mere few seconds etc etc.<br /><br />Also, wasn't it nice of the guard standing watch, to not struggle while his neck is being chomped on and to die in 5 seconds without a noise or spurting any blood............<br /><br />What used to be somewhat watchable and enjoyable (yet always somewhat far fetched) has turned into a complete joke of unrealistic moves, actions and timelines, just another good series gone bad due to poor writing and what probably amounts to the almighty dollar from the advertisers over content.<br /><br />I will not be watching any more "24" and will be happy with the show on DVD of all earlier seasons, maybe I can forget I started to watch the new season altogether.
