I only caught part of this show (from the Major General's entrance) on a recent showing on Sky TV in the UK and it restored my faith that G&S can be adapted with sensitivity for new audiences. I thought Jon English turned in a superb performance as the Pirate King and the comic scenes were played for all they were worth without (mostly) becoming unfunny. Choregoraphy - especially with the police in the second act was first class. A couple of minor quibbles - not sure why it was necessary to bring in the trio from Ruddigore - it seems fashionable these days to "cross-dress" so to speak and although this actually worked quite well it wasn't really necessary. The Swinglettes as a take off of the Andrews Sisters was superb but unfortunately it also meant that Edith was hardly distinguishable from the rest of the daughters when she has a decent part in the original score. Minor points, though, you could hear the audience absolutely loving it and it kept far enough on the traditional side of the line without being stuffy - Gilbert may have shuffled uncomfortably in his grave but he would not, I think, have turned right over. Well done all - even if it was thirteen years ago! Jonathon Clark, London
