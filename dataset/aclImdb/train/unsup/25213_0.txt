This restoration of the original 1926 production almost seems like an anachronism. We feel somewhat creepy watching a silent film in color. Although color entered the realm of silent film around 1923, over 95% of the silent films in color are lost. This is a rare treat (even though we only see browns, reds and blues and even though the water is sometimes red, sometimes blue) and along with the original score re-recorded and 19 minutes of outtakes following the 90 minute feature, it is somewhat of an event. The content is the usual formulaic action film, a real swashbuckler in the Errol Flynn sense of the word. Fairbanks, Billie Dove and Donald Crisp all perform well. Not a great film by any means but lovely to look at in this early color process' infancy. (For great two-strip Technicolor see Michael Curtiz' back to back horror films of the early thirties - DOCTOR X and MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM.
