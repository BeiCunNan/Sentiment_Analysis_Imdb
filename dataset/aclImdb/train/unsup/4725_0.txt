Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey both give us a solid performance in this comedy/romance movie. This is probably best viewed with a date, rather than with just the guys. It's not too high on the chick flick scale, yet it's still high enough to be watched with that special someone. Good acting by the two main leads, McConaughey and Hudson make this film enjoyable and a must see. It's also very funny at times.<br /><br />My rating: 8/10
