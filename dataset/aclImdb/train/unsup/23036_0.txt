I am a dyed in the wool fan of Gary Daniels and believe him to be one of the best martial artists working in movies today(if not the best)but this movie is truly terrible and one of the worst I have seen in a very long time.The direction by Darren Doane is as flat as a pancake and the movie is scuppered by long dialogue scenes(one between Gary and some guy on a bench lasts about 15 minutes)and there is a scene with an Oriental actress at the beginning which has no bearing on the plot at all and the lack of any acting skill by the actress concerned is truly a marvel to behold. There is worst to come;the entirely intrusive and impossible to listen to score destroys the very things you expect from a Gary Daniels movie,namely the action.His two long and protracted fight scenes include some good techniques as you would expect from Gary but unfortunately look like they were filmed by a blind cameraman suffering from Parkinson's disease.In any case they are ruined by that God awful music which even drowns out the fight sound effects and you have to ask yourself if any of the technical team working on BLACK FRIDAY had even so much as seen a movie before let alone worked on one.I have watched many of Gary's movies several times in the past(BLOODMOON,RIOT,RECOIL)but could never envisage watching this catastrophe again.If you can imagine what the worst episode of "Miami Vice" would have been like if performed by the most inept actors and crew money could buy then that gives you some idea of how bad BLACK FRIDAY IS.I have some advice for director Darren Doane and that is..in future Darren,don't!!
