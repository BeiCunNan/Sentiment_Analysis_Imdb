The little seen "Tucker" is a great movie. Jeff Bridges is one of those fine actors who is always professional and always innovative, and his performances are so reliably great one sometimes takes him for granted. I put him in the league of true movie pros such as Henry Fonda, James Stewart,Paul Newman and Kirk Douglas.<br /><br />Movie buffs will find the film splendidly acted and directed and car buffs will find this film intriguing for the Innovations that the Tucker Auto had right after World War 2 that caused the Big Car companies to do all they could to shut down this Innovative Car Company. Sadly the major Auto Manufacturers in Detroit would not be in the sorry state they are in at present had they been more creative and tried to do things better.Instead they felt that they had a lock on the American buying public and that no matter how good ( or weak) they produced a Car, the US Car buying public would purchase their products.<br /><br />This movie is not only about the Car Business it is about American Entrepreneurship and the spirit of competition and imagination that makes the US the wonder of the Business World.
