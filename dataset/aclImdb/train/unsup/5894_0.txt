Like many others here, I read the book a couple of years ago and I absolutely loved it. In fact, when I think about it, it's one of my all-time favorite books hands down.<br /><br />But so very often, you read a really good book and when it is made into a movie, it never measures up to the book. The characters "look different" from what you had in your head, the story gets changed, and the general spirit goes missing.<br /><br />Not in this case, I am happy to report! It was like seeing old friends again, even though I saw the movie for the fist time. Sure, due to run length-restrictions thinks got left out and were changed. But it still made a very good adaptation and a very, very good movie on it's own. I wasn't a big fan of Eric Bana when I first saw him in Hulk and even Munich. But I think, nobody could have played the role better than him. He just IS Henry DeTamble.<br /><br />All in all, big thanks to everybody who was involved in the making. You did very good!
