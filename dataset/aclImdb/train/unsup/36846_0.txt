I caught this "film" on HBO the other day, and I want those 90 minutes of my life back. The acting was painful to watch, and the plot was ridiculous. Humans from a thousand years in the future go back in time and kidnap those about to die in plane crashes in order to repopulate the planet. And they're not very good at it because they keep leaving things like "stunners" behind which makes them have to go back again to fix paradoxes. Way too convoluted, even for a sci-fi picture.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me from rating this a 1 is my respect for Kris Kristofferson. I guess he just had some bills to pay so he took the first script someone showed him. 2/10
