John Bunny (as Tupper) is intrigued by a newspaper item announcing the arrival of heiress Flora Finch (as Rachel Whipple). The rotund Mr. Bunny would like to win wealthy Ms. Finch's hand in marriage. Believing that Finch would prefer a bachelor to a widower, he packs up his two daughters, and sends them away. To further impress the lady, he starts a baseball team. When Finch exclaims, "I simply adore base ball players!" Bunny wonders if she might like players more than ownersÂ…<br /><br />Bunny was the prototype overweight comedian. Compared to the other actors, his complexion looks very bad in "Hearts and Diamonds". Though I am judging more from touched-up movie stills than movies, I was surprised at his unhealthy appearance. Perhaps, the illness that would soon claim him had some effect. Finch doesn't have as much to this time around; though, she and Bunny always make a striking couple. <br /><br />*** Hearts and Diamonds (9/26/14) George D.
