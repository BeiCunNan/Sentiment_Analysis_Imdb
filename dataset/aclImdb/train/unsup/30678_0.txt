Okay, okay... I can see why some people might not fall in love with this film. Kevin Costner can do that to you. But I enjoyed this movie and the lead actor tremendously. I liked the sweep of it, the lengthy exposition, as well as the action at the end. Admittedly, I'm a sucker for the subject matter--I enjoyed Tombstone and Kurt Russell as well.<br /><br />All that aside, Dennis Quaid should've won an Oscar for his portrayal of Doc Holliday. In my book, he was brilliant. Any time an actor that recognizable can fool me as to his identity for an entire movie he's done some serious acting. (I don't really care who's acting when I go to see a movie and don't study the playbills)
