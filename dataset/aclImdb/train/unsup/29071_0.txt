It's amazing what movies people will make these days. When I heard this was made in 1995, I was at first surprised and then understanding. This movie is a women in prison movie, and as such makes use for gratiutous nudity (thank you!) plenty of violence and a REALLY cheesy plot line. This movie is so cheesy I think more mice watch it than humans. A definite must for a bachelor party, a definite must not for anything else!
