I'm puzzled by some of the reviews I have seen. How many documentaries are over before you know it and leave you wanting more? I found it pretty amazing what these kids are capable of as well as how this all seemed to come together by accident. Paul Green teaches his students with a great deal of passion and more importantly has the respect for both their ability AND their potential ability. How many kids get to share the stage with actual rock icons? Some people seem put off by the "tough love" thing that is part of the instruction but it seemed to me that the only time he got impatient was when it was obvious that certain kids weren't trying their hardest. Besides, you can't really argue with teaching kids that they can get where they want to by working at it.
