What do you get when you combine an Aussie celeb and her hubby, a video camera, some Bondi regulars, and sexism and sleaze galore? The answer? Dust off the Wings.<br /><br />This film has been reviewed positively here on IMDb, but it's hard to see why ... Now, those who follow my reviews will know i appreciate some 'low-grade' stuff ... But this is really bottom of the barrel ... Basically a collection of (overlong) shorts of bloke surfing, blokes going on about the last 'chick' they scored, blokes and chicks getting tanked and discussing that gendered 'double standard', blokes and chicks getting their rocks off like they told their mates/girlfriends they do ...<br /><br />Not much of a plot, no character development. Most appealing character is Kate Ceberano's, and she and her husband made the film (funny that!) And did anyone catch who the bride actually was? I finished watching the film a few hrs ago, i can't remember her!! The title refers to a metaphor, but one that is so plain dumb it's not worth repeating. And don't get me started on this movie's sexual politics!! 'Dust' is the love child of 'Kids' and 'They're a Weird Bunch' - except it makes those films look like revolutionary film-making! If that excites you, tune in. If not ...
