Wesley Snipes play the part of an ex-soldier that is going to marry his girlfriend, but, in a bar, he is confused with another person and a group of traitors to CIA inject him a powerful drug that mixes reality and memory. He and his girlfriend have to fight in order to find an antidote and to crush the organization that has attacked Wesley. A typical bad action film, with all the clich√©s that can be found in this kind of films. Directed poorly, with scenes not very well-done and a lot of unbelievable moments of mastery in aiming. Neither the actors nor the plot are very good so the film is quite bad. On the other hand it has any moment of breathe and the action does not bore the spectator, (unexpected) which is a (little) good point. Ideal for TVfilm (it was originally thought as one), for seeing and forgot, but a little enjoyable if you like action films
