I've been seeing this movie around the local DVD-stores and thought, what the heck... I'll try it.<br /><br />The cover and DVD-menu promises a slick and stylish crime-triller. What I saw in the actual movie was something completely different.<br /><br />Only plus was the Valhalla-gang that made me think a little on the tracks of Guy Ritchie. Rest of the movie just felt sloppy and I had trouble even knowing WHY they where shooting at each other... What's Lis' motivation? The major downside was the actual action... horribly mish-mach-cut and often at the point of unwatchable... never seen a action-flick where the action was the tiresome parts...<br /><br />I have no problem with foreign films, subs I consider as the only thing remotely workable... dubbing is a sin... but if this is the highpoint of Russian action, well... I'll skip it...<br /><br />My advice? don't spend more than the couple of bucks for renting it...
