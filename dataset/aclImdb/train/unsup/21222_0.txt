If you actually seen this film. Im plays out to be a lot about Tupca Shakur / Suge Knight and the whole Death Row Records. Its very obvious that this is what the movie is really about. You have to be a fool not to think so. So the film is inspired by Tupac's life and experiences with Death Row Records. Red HQ, Juvenile as Tupac, Suge, etc. Even faked death, and came back. It a very good movie, about Tupac and Death Row Records.<br /><br />The film in a whole is OK! But I would've felt like the director, Paul Wynne could do something more better.. Unlike Charlie's Angels (film-wise..) there was a lot of things.. Humour, action, love, etc.. which all makes up the whole film entertaining.. This one was almost hits the mark.. Mind you, the three lead characters were good. They stood out alright.. But this is a black urban version of Charlie's Angels.. The rap music did get me going.. There are musical tracks on there that I was really rocking to.. which made me (the viewer) kept going with the film..
