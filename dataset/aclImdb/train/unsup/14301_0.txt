Dumb, dumb, dumb This is not so much for this Chan film alone as for pretty much all of the Monogram Chan flicks that starred Sidney Toler. I enjoyed all 6 or seven of the original Charlie Chan novels by Biggers. And I like some of the Warner Oland entries, although they included a bit too much humor at times for my taste in mysteries. But these late movies are, for the most part, just plain stupid. And the stereotypical wide-eyed "frightened Negro" shenanigans of Mantan Moreland are repetitive to the point of perverse tediousness. I started collecting the movies after reading the books and I gotta say: I do enjoy low budget, low grade films sometimes for the simple pleasure and nostalgia they evoke. But these are not "so bad they're good" ~ they're just bad.
