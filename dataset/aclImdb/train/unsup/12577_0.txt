This movie is the one of my favorite movies ever!!!!!! Kimberly J. Brown is really good at it. And Daniel Kountz was really good 2. This movie is also funny and a lot more action than the first one. The one thing that I did not like about this movie is the Halloweentown. That gray spell is dumb. Other than that this movie is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sophie was also a good actor too. What was cool is how Mrs. Cromwell turned into that green goblin by Kalabar's Spell. But The First Halloweentown movie is a little better. One funny thing about this film is when that girl became Dracula and said "I'm also really thirsty". That was really funny. Halloweentown II Kalabar's Revenge is awesome!!
