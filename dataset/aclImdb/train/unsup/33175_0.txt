I rented this in the hope of seeing an original take on the post-apocalypse genre. What I got was something more boring and pointless than I could have possibly imagined. Okay, lets be fair. Not everything is going to be the Road Warrior. However, this movie promises to showcase the "terrifying...danger" of the new world, and last time i checked, overlong shots of nothing happening coupled with occasional histrionic shrieking do not a good film make. Nothing of interest happens in the film. The post apocalypse genre is horribly underused, and almost limitless in its potential. To make a movie like this is tantamount to being offered one million dollars to spend on any car of your choice and choosing a 1987 Chevy Nova with no muffler. Speaking of money, its not like they were particularly constrained by budget. There are real actors in the movie, who probably got more than a little compensation for appearing, not to mention countless extras. Besides this, however, there is nothing original or dynamic to be had. The "society" that is formed in the train depot is about as generic and lame as anyone could ask. I ask you, what threatens these people? Being bored to death? this pushes the boundaries of avant-garde filmaking over into the realm of crap. The acting is unremarkable and perhaps even irrelevant to the story. The cinematography is appealing, but NOTHING IS DONE WITH IT. There is no sense of imminent danger. I didn't feel for the characters at all. I would recommend this film to snooty intellectuals who think that a ten minute long shot of a french child burying a parakeet is the apex of modern cinema. To everyone else, I would recommend a six pack of beer and a double feature of Mad Max and A Boy and His Dog. It would be infinitely more enjoyable.
