I stumbled across this piece of divine French film whilst channeling surfing one night. I suppose the reason I put the remote down was that I am an avid lover of French Film and as a French language student, it was a wonderful chance to enrich my developing French ear. However, I soon forgot the latter and became bewitched by the mysterious and erratic struggling Australian actress Sarah and her tranquil and doting Chinese neighbor, Mr Zao.<br /><br />Despite Sarah being very much disliked by all the tenants of her apartment building and Mr Zao loosing his calm patience for his obnoxious and piggish neighbor who visits him only for cigarettes and a chance to make vulgar remarks about Sarah, the lonely souls soon embark on a deep and touching friendship which sees awkward play rehearsals, delightful meals and a life saved.<br /><br />Enchanting cinematography, a subtle romantic air and a perfect cast make this a true masterpiece of Art-house film.
