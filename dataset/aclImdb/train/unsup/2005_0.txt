The war is over and there are still some heroes left. A few of these former military pilots get together to deliver war-surplus aircraft to their new (mostly civilian) owners, and these deliveries take them around the world. As a wanna-be (or wish-I-could-have-been) combat pilot I got to see some of the true aircraft stars of WWII. Even the soap-opera romance scenes were kinda cute and light-hearted. I actually enjoyed the movie and think it was very entertaining. The 3 stars interacted well and the movie was not too unbalanced. Was the plot familiar and the ending predictable ?? ABSOLUTELY !!!! So what ?? Name a single Elvis Presley or James Bond movie that wasn't as well ?? This film was not Academy Award material but it is much better than several films I have seen that have won Academy Awards. It is also much better than most of the trash that is being produced for TV and movie theaters today. I, for one, hope it makes it to DVD. If you don't like it...(heck, this IS America)...don't watch it !!
