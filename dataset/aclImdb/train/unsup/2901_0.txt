Just caught this movie at the San Fernando Valley Film Festival and was really taken aback by its quiet power. Very much in the "Stand By Me"/"Last Picture Show"/"Summer of '42" mode, it will hopefully find a wider audience outside the fest circuit. Very well-acted by a mix of newcomers and veteran talent, "The Garage" has a great, evocative look, and subtly brings back its late 1970s, pre-MTV time period. It's one of those universal stories about small town life that anyone who's ever left home--or thought about it, will definitely be moved by. The music and cinematography were impressive, too. Check it out if it lands at a festival or theatre near you.
