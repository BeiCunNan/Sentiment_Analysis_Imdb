The Attic Expeditions is filled with symbolism and hidden meanings. Each backdrop, costume, and film angle enhances the story-line of this rich film. It has a taste of everything from a slasher's gore to a drama's character conflict, all wrapped up in a web of instability and confusion that would make Hitchcock proud. From the moment the film started to its final scene, The Attic Expeditions had my rapt attention. I still see its scenes playing back in my mind as I try to wrap my thoughts around the plot. Finally, a horror movie in the classic tradition of unsettling fear that stays with you for months after you see the film. I can't wait to see it again.
