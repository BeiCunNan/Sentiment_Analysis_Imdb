In my humble opinion, "Deep Space Nine" is the best of all Star Trek shows produced to date! It had it all! space based science fiction, elements of fantasy (The Prophets and Sisko as The Emmissary), political intrigue and of course, lots of action. It's unfortunate that no feature length movies have been made because I, for one, would love to know what Sisko learned while moving among the prophets after falling into the fire cave (Final Episode). Adding Michael Dorn was sheer brilliance on the part of the producers but the loss of Terry Ferral was just brutal (killed off final episode, season before the final season) Marc Alaimo , as Gul Dukat made it east to dislike the Cardassians while Aron Eisenberg made it easy to appreciate the Ferengi! I know there are those of you that believe ST: TNG was better and I wont even argue with the Original Trekkies but for my viewing currency, Deep Sapce Nine is without equal!
