This movie was a big, bumbling mess. There were a few humorous lines, but the viewer expects more laughs from a sex farce. I don't even think the flimsy plot was worth an entire 97 minutes; it seemed like it would have felt more at home as an hour-long comedy on Cinemax. Mariel Hemmingway was severely miscast as the bisexual wife, because she walked through the role like she didn't know what she was doing there. However, the lead actor Mike Binder (also the writer and director) put in a spirited performance. He reminded me of a cross between Matt Lauer and Woody Allen, and I'd like to see what he could do in future roles. The only other funny character in the movie was a radio voice- a lesbian obsessed DJ who was imitating Howard Stern. And for those who are intrigued by the movie's title: there was very little sex or nudity on-screen.<br /><br />The DVD is in pan-and-scan format, and the only extra is the trailer.
