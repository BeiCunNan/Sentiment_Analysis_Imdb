How utterly boring. Just because this film is different from the usual horror flicks I don't know how anyone could possibly like the film. True it did not contain any of the usual elements of gore & horror that we've seen before but how can that be an endorsement for boredom. Waiting for some character development to resume between the student & the girl but it never did. About the only thing I liked was the portrayal of Dr Vic by the Jack Nicholson lookalike actor. Didn't anyone else see the resemblance?? Oh and the last scene where the real doctor comes back to life was pathetic to say the least. Sorry but I could not rate this any higher.
