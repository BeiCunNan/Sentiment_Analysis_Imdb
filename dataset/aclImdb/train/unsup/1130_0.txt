just finished watching "The Man"with Samuel.L Jackson and Eugene Levy.not a bad offering.it's sort of in the vein of "48 hours".now i'm not equating the 2 movies with each other,though i do seem to recall being less than impressed with "48 hours.i did however find "the Man" entertaining from beginning to end,from both a dramatic viewpoint and a comedic one.the 2 stars are both very gifted actors,so it was good to see them in action.admittedly,the film was kind of light in tone(it could have had been a bit more substantial) and very short in its running time.however,for what it was,it worked very well.i do have one small complaint dough and that is that the movie did seem a bit mean spirited in the beginning.not sure why that would bother me,since i would usually not complain about something like that.(it'a petty complaint,i'll admit) maybe i'm becoming someone who gets offended easily.in my ripe old age of 36.I hope not.anyway,i soon forgot about that and enjoyed the movie. a strong 7* out of 10
