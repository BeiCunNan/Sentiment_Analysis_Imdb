I started to watch this movie but gave up because it was so poorly made. I looked at the reviews and, for the most part, Christians thought it was manna from heaven, and others thought it stank. But this shows the differences between Christians and others - Christians, for the most part, are seriously deluded in their beliefs, and any film like this will have them patently ignoring their senses and lauding nonsense. Seriously, how can any sane, non-delusional human being say this load of tripe is the best movie every made? And why do 'others' say it like it is? The answer is because Christians are delusional and others are realists. I know which group I prefer.
