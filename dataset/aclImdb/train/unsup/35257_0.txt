Like Joel says in the end: "This movie sucks!!"<br /><br />This has everything: bad acting, horrible dialogue, special effects by the local high school cinema club, and much more crap. In a word, a mummy is found, accidental overexposure to radiation (how original) turns the campus into a frenzy as the mummy is not pleased! Apparently, he hates it when he loses his marbles. The 80's theme is definitely there which makes this even more deplorable. I love towards the end when the campus president's evil assistant enunciates every syllable of his lines. On the good note, a lot of despicable characters are offed in the film. Classic final scene had me laughing myself to abdominal cramps. You won't be seeing green after viewing this pathetic tripe of a movie.<br /><br />Oh and watch out for the fungus. (it's a mungus!!)<br /><br />
