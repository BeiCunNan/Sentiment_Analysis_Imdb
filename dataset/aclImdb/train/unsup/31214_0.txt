Comment already written:<br /><br />Okay, you got a kid with a video camera videotaping a family's alien experiences. Three mistakes: 1) The second time they aired it, they put in "lost scenes". That only comes with a real movie, not a video recording. 2) They picked a guy who actually had a filmography (meaning he had acted before in noticeable shows). 3) The fatal mistake: THEY CREDITED THE ACTORS IN THE VIDEOTAPE!!! IT SAID "ALIEN 1: SO-AND-SO", LIKE THAT! SERIOUSLY, UPN, HOW STUPID DO YOU THINK THE PUBLIC IS? And now the sad part. 50% of America thought this was a real videotape! If you never saw this, stay away from it at all costs!<br /><br />My comment:<br /><br />Well, if 50% of america believed it was a real video. I would give it a 10 !!! I saw the movie and I first thought it was real too. It is a well thought and good made video. It really seems like they's verry affraid. And besides all this, it was really thrilling. So, .. good movie..
