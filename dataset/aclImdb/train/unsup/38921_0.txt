This Swedish police movie contains everything that is bad in the genre and runs it once again, but in an almost amateurish way. If I say that the superintendent's daughter, with a fresh exam from the Police Academy, arrives at her father's police station, you know the rest. There are conflicts and cliché on cliché on cliché. After less than half an hour you know who've done the bad things and who will do it in the future. If you get frightened of the jump scenes, this must be your first action movie.<br /><br />Krister Henriksson is far from the level of his predecessor in these films, Rolf Lassgård. Johanna Sällström fights hard against the script, but doesn't win the fight.<br /><br />I thought Henning Mankell, the man behind the books about this superintendent working in a small Swedish town, was radical but he seems to be just "radical chic". Let's hope he gets a lot of money for lending his copper to this crap.
