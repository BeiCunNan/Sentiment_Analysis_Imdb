This tries too hard to be a quirky romantic comedy, but in the end leaves you with just a slightly dirty, creepy feeling about the main character. The movie is rife with illogical leaps, inconsistent characters and a premise that simply makes no sense. This is, unfortunately, simply a Til Schweiger (popular German heartthrob) delivery medium -- the story was written so that he wouldn't have to step outside of the same role he always plays: a smirky, semi-jerk who, in the end, proves he really does have a heart if everyone will just give him a (2nd) chance to show it.<br /><br />If you really liked Kein Ohr Hasen (a better film, watch it first if you can), then you might like this, but otherwise stay away.
