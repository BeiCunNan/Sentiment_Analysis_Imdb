The Bad and the Beautiful is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. To begin, each character is so perfectly written and performed that only Vincente Minnelli could have been the director. Kirk Douglas as Johnathan Shields was unbelievably excellent. Johnathan felt like a real person and the way Douglas played him the character came to life. Lana Turner was fantastic as Georgia Lorrison. Even in silence, Turner brought something so special to Georgia that no actress would ever be able to bring the character justice again. Turner and Douglas were certainly deserving of an Academy Award for their brilliant acting performances and it is a crime that Turner was completely snubbed. To boot, Minnelli was denied an Oscar nod along with the film as a whole for Best Picture. Gloria Grahme however was honored with an Academy Award for her delightful and refreshingly sanguine portrayal of Rosemary. However, I don't think Grahme was not on the screen more than 10 minutes. Is that really deserving of a prestigious award like an Oscar? Even so, The Bad and the Beautiful is pure excellence and a film that all movie lovers should experience. The drama is intense and every moment that the stars are on screen is magnificence.
