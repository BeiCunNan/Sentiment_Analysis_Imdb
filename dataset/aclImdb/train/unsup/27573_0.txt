When over 10 years passes between sequels, it's generally not a good sign. For every "The Color of Money," there are several "Two Jakes," pointless sequels made for a quick buck that may or may not materialize. <br /><br />Go ahead and toss "Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles" into the pointless category. I guess you could watch this with your kids for harmless fun. But if your kids are old enough to remember the first two films in this franchise, they're too old to enjoy this one.<br /><br />Aside from showcasing the adverse effects of prolonged exposure to the sun, there was zero reason to drag out leather-skinned Paul Hogan for another installment of "The Croc." A silly plot, flat jokes, and some of the laziest acting this side of "Con Air" make this film entirely unnecessary.<br /><br />For humor, you're better off hitting an open-mic night. And for that old Australian charm, hell, you're better off at Outback Steakhouse. And that ain't a compliment to Outback.<br /><br />Pass.
