The Gangster film trilogy is complete. Not Only does Hitters have an incredible cats, but a beautiful look (camera work and sets rocked!) and a true representation of FAMILY. I know I have a better relationship with my husband and his family because of this film. It hit so many of those funny little typical moments that we all have experienced and shared with loved ones. HITTERS 2 should be Robert Davi and Costas Madylor in a steel cage. Was that Adult film star Ruby Jewles in the night club? I hear she use to date the Director. She is one of the few actresses I could see crossover to main stream without any problems.
