"Black Robe" is a film I have seen at least a dozen times and it continues to cause utter astonishment. The highest quality that any art can have is the ability to arrest the mind of the viewer. Days later imagery is still flooding back to you -- feelings -- ideas -- and of course questions... But questions that properly have no easy answers. The first time I saw this film was about 15 years ago when it was first released. I watched it in a Toronto cinema and afterward emerged into a warm and noisy downtown night, crowded with people, signs, lights cars taxis subways et cetera. Immediately, I was in culture shock. The movie had so taken me into the world of 17th century Canada that I could not adjust to the reality of 20th century Canada. It still has that effect. Astonishing.
