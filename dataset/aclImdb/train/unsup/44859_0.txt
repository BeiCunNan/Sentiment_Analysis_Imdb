Arnold's acting debut came in a period in his life when I guess bodybuilding was his main interest. I certainly hope so, for he acts so bad in this movie that it's torture to sit through it. Bad acting from one person only doesn't necessary make a movie a total disaster, but when just EVERYTHING ELSE also are as horrible as they can be, then we have a movie that never should've been made. Here, I'll mention a few things that I especially noticed as bad: <br /><br />- In the fight at the wharf, you clearly see that the people who get pushed into the water stops at the edge, and then jumps into the water themselves. I guess they just found some workers at a ship nearby and offered them a dime each to take part in this scene. <br /><br />- The bear in the park was so badly made that you have to see it to believe it <br /><br />- In the scenes with the Greek gods at the Olymp, you often hear car horns in the background. Tip to all future movie makers: When shooting a movie with Greek gods in their home, DO NOT PLACE THE SET NEXT TO A HIGHWAY.<br /><br />This flick is only suitable for die hard-fans of muscle-flexing and bad German accents. Everybody else, Arnold-fans included, should avoid this movie at all costs.
