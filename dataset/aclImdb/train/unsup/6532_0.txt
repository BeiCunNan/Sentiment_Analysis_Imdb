SPOILERS: IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE PLOT OF THIS GOD AWFUL FILM THEN DON'T READ.<br /><br />After September 11; Nato sanctioned the secret launch of EMP Laser satellites designed to be used as a weapon (forgot the purpose) but they've malfunctioned and in a short (but unknown cause I'm forgotten) period of time they're all going to go off which will cause the destruction of every electrical device on the planet and sent the world back to the stone age. They can't shoot down the satellites cause they're designed to EMP anything that enters a mile of its orbit. So the only way to stop it is by turning it off at the 'Cube' on K2.<br /><br />Obviously there's terrorists (Russian Terrorsits :O) dodgy Russian's, one of the climbing team has mysteriously been killed so the leader has asked his old climbing friend to join them who is now a monk after him and the leader lost a friend on a climb.<br /><br />It's lame, it's crap but if its on TV beats watching some other crap with adverts every 5 minutes (if in America) or if you come home from 6th Form to find there is nothing on you haven't already seen at least 17 times and your only hope is, I kneel and pray, crap TV Movies on the Sci Fi Channel.
