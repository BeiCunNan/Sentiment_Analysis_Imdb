This film is amazing.<br /><br />I'm not a very emotive person when it comes to films as I know that it's all fictional but Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore do make a believable couple. When Sandler sings to Barrymore at the end of the film, the way she portrays her reaction makes me feel how she must feel. Sandler portrays some-one in love extremely well, when he's singing to her he looks at her as if she's the only person on the whole plane which just sums up what love is really. This film is romantic, its entertaining, its fun. Best of all, even though were in 2006 I don't feel this film is out of date even though it's set in 1985.<br /><br />Best film I have ever seen by far.
