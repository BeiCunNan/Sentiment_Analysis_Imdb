WOW, does this film age poorly. Back in the 30s, Mae West was quite popular and this movie, believe it or not, was up for Best Picture. Now, most viewers will doubtless ask themselves "what is all the fuss about--WHY was this film so popular?". After all, by today's standards it's a very dull and contrived movie--not nearly as interesting as Paramount's other comedians, WC Fields and The Marx Brothers. And, for a comedy, it's almost completely devoid of humor. For me, seeing the trampy looking West vamping every man in the film is ludicrous, as she just looks gross and unattractive. This is even more apparent when she woos a very young and handsome Cary Grant. This is about as believable as the bride of Frankenstein winning Grant's hand! All in all, a very contrived movie and not a whole lot different than most of West's other films. In fact, this movie is pretty much I'M NO ANGEL (1933 AS WELL) all over again (complete with, once again, a drooling Cary Grant as her main heartthrob).
