Someone hired a few names from the Italian horror field and thought that was enough for a passable thriller.<br /><br />Boy, were THEY wrong.<br /><br />Ricci screwed this up in every way imaginable.<br /><br />The effects looked like the were made by kindergarten kids using finger paints. And the tension was non-existent. The camera work was laughable. Hiding behind furniture does not make a scene suddenly scary.<br /><br />The idea itself was the only redeeming quality. And I usually like to see David Warbeck or Janet Agren. But the must have needed the money badly to include themselves in this piece of tripe.<br /><br />Blow this one off.
