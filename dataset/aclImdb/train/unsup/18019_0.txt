I lost interest in this show when i was 7.They used gibberish 24/7. I was peeved when Olie told me that the were evil toys trying to hurt me. I went into this phase and started to talk to Lifeless objects like the stove. the gram pa scared the #%$@ out of me and still does**shudder**. Rolie land gave me nightmares about Alien-Robots. So i started watching LAW & ORDER SVU. My grades went up and I started drooping cartoons and watched the HISTORY channel. But Ollie left a dent in my life witch can never be fixed. Children, Do not Watch this horrible show!!! DO NOT BUY ANY OF HIS MERCHANDISE OR WATCH HIS SHOW. But like a turd on the sidewalk, you can learn a lot from him.
