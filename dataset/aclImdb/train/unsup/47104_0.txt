The real plot summary of this movie is: THREE CUTE CHICKS SAYING AND DOING THE STUPIDEST THINGS BUT LOOKING GREAT WHILE DOING IT! Like Alex (Lucy Liu) that climbed a mountain and then to a helicopter wearing high heels!<br /><br />Action movies always abund in wisecracks at the most inadequate times but this one really beats them all. One of the bad guys runs from the "angels" and Alex (Lucy Liu) goes: "Why do they always have to run?" A dialog can´t get any worse than that, I thought! But then Vivian (Kelly Lynch) goes: "Never send a man to do a woman´s job." Oh, please!!! Or in the middle of a cat fight, Natalie (Cameron Diaz) telling Vivian: "Do you know how hard it is to find a quality man in Los Angeles?" Who cares?! She´s already made her point by staying on the phone with the guy while both her life and Bosley´s as well as the whole mission were at stake. To see more things that ruined this great idea read the "goofs" section and also the "memorable quotes".<br /><br />It just seems hard to believe that the creators of the tv-series would write the script for this... mock of the series!<br /><br />Then the cast! Lucy Liu as a fragile little woman baking muffins?! I don´t think so! Or Drew Barrymore saying "And that´sss kicking your assss!" And I´m sure the guys loved the shaking butt of Cameron Diaz but it didn´t do anything for me. As for the bad guys... only Vivian (Kelly Lynch) was convincing. Tom Green was the only good choice as Chad and the only fun in the movie as far as I´m concerned. As for Matt LeBlanc, I´m looking forward to seeing him in a role other than that of a "bad actor-good lover".<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie - besides "the Chad" - was the surprising soundtrack! I would´ve never imagined I could hear Sir Mix-A-Lot or Prodigy in a big Hollywood production!
