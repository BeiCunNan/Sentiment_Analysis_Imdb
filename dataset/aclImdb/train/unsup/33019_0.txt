Having just watched this movie at its premier as part of the London Film Festival 2003, I have to say I came out being sorely disappointed.<br /><br />The movie is basically a series of loosely coupled cinematic clich√©s stitched together in a rom-com template. First timer Karl Golden has mistakenly crammed too many tricks on to the screen, and the jarring jump-cuts, grainy stock and jerky camera movements are not innovative, merely annoying and nauseating. It is truly a sad indictment of the state of the British film industry when funding can be made available for predictable, plodding, saccharine nonsense like this at the expense of other more worthy projects.
