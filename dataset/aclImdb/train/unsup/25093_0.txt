I loved this movie when I first saw it and I have enjoyed watching it again and again. Although it is not a "perfect" movie, I think the overall feeling one gets from its mixture of western, mystery, and romance themes is something quite special. It's true that the story pushes the limits of credibility, but that is what makes it special . . . that something we thought was gone is still here just over that next mountainside. It is based upon enough fact that the viewer thinks it just might be true. In my book, any movie that leaves you wanting to know more of the story, to visit the places where it occurred, and to learn the facts behind it is good story telling worth suggesting to others.
