Gregory's Girl is a forerunner of films like Napoleon Dynamite and 40 Year Old Virgin and subtle like the former, not obvious like the latter. If you were ever an innocent adolescent and can recall your first infatuation with a girl with a wry smile, then this will make you laugh at yourself and cry at the same time - what more can you ask from a film? I can still remember the cinema, the seat, the friends I first saw this film with - myself British and a friend Ausralian, both weeping with laughter as we recognised ourselves in that gawky Scottish lad, and his hilarious younger sister. Bill Forsyth went on to the film "Local Hero", which is also right up there with the greats in my scoring. He made films about real people and all our idiosyncrasies, and made me feel and enjoy at the same time. Favourite scene follows favourite scene - when Gregory walks in front of a car, his father is the driving instructor, when Gregory lies on the ground with "not" Gregory's Girl, held onto the surface of the earth by "the mysterious force of gravity", the boys out taking photos of a nurse undressing using so many elephants at F8, Gregory spraying deodorant onto his shirt, his friend the expert chef, etc. I guess many Americans find the Scottish language incomprehensible - so put on the subtitles! I can understand and enjoy Napoleon - you can enjoy Gregory!
