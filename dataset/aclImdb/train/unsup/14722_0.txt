"The first opening shot sets the tone of the movieÂ… its about dance, music, art and also it is about happiness, love, culture, goodness in human beings. If you apply the first 15 min formula (word courtesy my friend, raj), you know that this movie rocks! It grips you from the first scene till the last scene. The story starts in flashback which madhuri tells to her daughter..."<br /><br />"All the actors and actresses in the movie are perfectly cast. Everyone does their job best. To mention the few are Kunal Kapoor as Imraan who acts as Majnoo in dia's show. Shushmita Mukherjee, as Mrs Chojar is good. Mr. Chojar, a boring government offices played by Vinay Kapoor is hilarious. His friend, Ranbir shorey, plays mohan, the hotel owner. He is silent lover of madhuri. Her real life majnoo (in the film). Also the child artist who plays the role of dia's daughter is also good. The most standout performance is by Akshaye Khanna as a young generation MP. He acts the role with elan and style. He brightens up the screen every time he is there. His character is most contemporary political character we have ever seen in bollywood movies. Both the role and the actors deserves applause..."
