Agatha Christie must be turning in her grave with the recent daft tarting up of her excellent plot, i.e. the reconstruction of the crime in the denouement of "4-50 from Paddington". (I refer to the series "Marple" starring Geraldine McEwan, not to be confused with the previous series starring the excellent Joan Hickson.) To have made this said reconstruction possible the two trains would have needed to be timed to the second, an event I find extremely implausible. Just as Agatha Christie would have.<br /><br />Even in the Fifties people were complaining of late trains and the British railway system in general.<br /><br />Geraldine McEwan brings a pleasant quirkiness into the character, and in her own way is quite as good as the aforementioned Miss Hickson, but oh dear, if producers and directors must tart up old novels I wish they would retain the story lines and keep them sensible.
