I've been a fan death note after the watching the 1st series of Anime; and I started reading the manga because the anime wasn't coming out fast enough. the overall the concept of Death Note is intelligent, exciting and has a great story. I was shocked to find that 75% of this movie's story was not from the manga. right from the start: Light's girlfriend dying? TV reporter Takada? where did they come from? aside from new characters, the part where Kira openly says he's the 2nd kira? these points made the movie less intelligent and also more predictable. the acting and direction of the movie was also poor. <br /><br />but the strangest part of watching this midnight on a Friday night was that every time Ruuk spoke - the whole cinema would laugh out loud. If you're a fan of the manga; don't bother watching this movie.
