I enjoyed Disney's Christmas release last year so I thought that I'd pick up this movie as well. I regret it! It's a complete waste of whatever you spend on it. The movie is a poor compilation of only a handful of Disney Christmas shorts. The best part of it is the obviously edited version of Disney's Christmas Carol and even at that it's not worth it. This movie is a disgrace, don't waste your time.
