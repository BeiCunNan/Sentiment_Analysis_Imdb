Four completely unlikable characters played by four of the worst actresses ever seen, a script that moves along at a pace that would make a snail look like Wilma Rudolph, pointless and goofy religious "symbolism," awful lighting and cinematography... all add up to the biggest waste of time you will ever know. The only reason for sitting through this amateur self-indulgence is the hope that finally, at long last, the screenwriter will have an idea and something will happen (and, hopefully, some of these horrible people will get slaughtered!). We should pray for financial ruin to befall whoever financed this ridiculous twaddle so that these people can never make another film ever again. If you're expecting this to be one of those films that's so awful it's great, no such luck. Just plain awful. Period. But, at this point, the friends and family members of the filmmakers have managed to get the votes up to 8 stars. Don't be fooled; it's only a matter of time before real audiences start wasting their time and money on this catastrophe and registering real votes.
