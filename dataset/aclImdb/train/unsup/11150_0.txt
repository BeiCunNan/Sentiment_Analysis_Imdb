I ordered this on OnDemand a few weeks ago and I wasn't at all impressed with the film.<br /><br />I was, however, impressed with Kimberly Elise's and Loretta Devine's performances. Those two women alone carry this mess of a film.<br /><br />The film is filled with clich√©s. And the way the story is presented is sort of mismatched and should've been shown in the proper order, from front to back, not from back to front (with the ending being first.) The film could've been a really great one if somebody touched up the screenplay and got a better director.<br /><br />With that all being said, the film has a powerful opening and two powerful performances from Kimberly Elise and Loretta Devine.<br /><br />It's sad how two actresses (both of whom are personal favorites of mine) are reduced to getting scraps like this for films.<br /><br />Their immense talent is wasted on awful, forgettable movies such as this when it should be used in good quality films that zip them off to the Oscars.<br /><br />It's sad that Hollywood has this bunch of actresses that they have no idea what to do with so the real talent is left to getting D-grade fair such as this.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that it's a black or white thing as far as actors/actresses getting good roles but Hollywood sure has a lot of underused talent with black actors. The mentioned Loretta Devine and Kimberly Elise come to mind, as well as Whoopi Goldberg. After The Color Purple all she got was those pathetic comedies (with only sister Act and Ghost rising to the occasion.) <br /><br />With that being said there are just as many white actors as there are black actors that Hollywood has no idea what to do with so I don't think it's a matter of Hollywood being racist anymore, just being stupid.
