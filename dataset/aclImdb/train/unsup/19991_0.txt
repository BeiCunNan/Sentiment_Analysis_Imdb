I liked it. I love McMurtry and I think the movie does a good job recreating his whacky characters. Although the teenage year crises are exaggerated, anyone with teenagers can appreciate the trials and tribulations of those years. The way in which all the children turn out to be good people proves that the early years of development can help young people (and parents and grandparents) to survive the difficult teens.
