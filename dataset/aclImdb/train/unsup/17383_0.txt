After seeing Kamal Ahmed's "God has a rap sheet" some time ago,I was left with a feeling of being hit over the head by a social studies teacher! The movie takes place on a hot summer's night in a New York city holding cell,where eight different men of all creeds,share the cell with a homeless man who claims to be God. The movie covered every issue that is concerning today's issues like history,race,sex and religion. Some of it seemed slightly heavy handed,but after thinking about it,I realized Ahmed's intention was to challenge one's views about these subjects. In today's world of Independent cinema,this movie to me is what "Independant" is all about- A Writer/Director with a vision,and making it all come together on the big (or should I say small) screen.
