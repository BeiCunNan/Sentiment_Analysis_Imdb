This movie certainly has the elements. The plot is mediocre, and suspense is terrific, the CG is spectacular, with a lot of attention to details. The motions are exacting to the tiniest intricacies. (although the dinosaurs depicted didn't exist all at once). The dinosaur era lasted for millions and millions of years. So I kind of feel bad every time I go for a fill-up @ the pump. I'd initially expected this movie to bomb like Waterworld, but after the initial openings almost topping 40 Mil, it may do as well as Titanic (not quite). I usually don't like Disney movies, but I do recommend this movie.
