I have not seen this picture and probably never will. I am disappointed that Richard Tyson is unable to be cast in a decent movie. I feel he has the chops and when younger was a sexy, bad boy, actor. I hope as he has matured he will be offered rolls as a mature romantic lead or second banana. That I would go see.The other members of the cast are mostly unknown to me. I admit to being an older woman but do enjoy movies that have a realistic story line good actors and well written dialog. The teen crowd isn't the only demographic that enjoys a good thriller but not the crud they produce now-a-days. Lets put our brains to work and come up with some good stories for the viewing audience.
