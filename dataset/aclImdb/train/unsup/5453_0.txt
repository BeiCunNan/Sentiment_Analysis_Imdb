Without a doubt, this low budget movie is cool and has its moments. The story is dim and unreliable but the action is OK. The set of the film is almost shot inside a house.<br /><br />There lives a hot girl called Gail, and if you, common mortal man, got fascinated for her body, no wonder the bad spirits/bad angels hasn't got too.<br /><br />There's plenty of seductive actions made involuntarily by Gail towards her sister's husband. There's hot/sensual scenes. There's good Special Effects. There's a fair dose of acting in all that but you cannot say this is a good or extraordinary flick.<br /><br />The director tries to rush to the action/sensual or erotic scenes. There's no cornerstone to substantiate the whole story. You're led to the basic: Demon exorcism, swearing, erotic moves and decadence in one jovial teenage.<br /><br />I can say: Give it a try.
