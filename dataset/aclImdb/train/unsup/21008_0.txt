I loved Aladdin. I bought Return of Jafar the day it was released on video. I wrapped it and put it under the tree for my 3 year old daughter. I counted the days til we could open it and watch the long awaited sequel. One of the biggest disappointments ever. (for me) Script was dismal, plot was worse. >
