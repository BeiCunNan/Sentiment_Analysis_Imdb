Trash. This thing is even worse than Demon Under Glass, a product of the producers. The plot is beyond amateurish, the writing lame, the acting so mediocre it hurts, the photography lousy. There's just nothing there and it just goes nowhere. The fact that they got an actor from Star Trek only goes to show how busy he wasn't. The poor guy really must've needed the bucks. And apparently, other than a VERY small cult, nobody cares. Maybe it's time Warner and Cunningham, who know how to whip up hype then deliver nothing at all, stop torturing people and admit to themselves they need to be in a field other than film or TV. Politics, maybe? Lotta false hype there.
