1st watched 2/2/2010  7 out of 10 (Dir-Corey Yuen): Well done action movie with incredibly well crafted action sequences. The story is about a prosecutor, played by Yuen Biao, who likes to take the law into his own hands whenever he gets the chance. If the court ruling is in favor of the guilty party, he goes after them individually. Cynthia Rothrock plays a cop who's after him for the murder of one of the guilty parties that was let go by the courts. This is an interesting twist on the otherwise formulaic story because you really don't know who to route for. Both parties are just trying to do their jobs but both do add a little persuasion with their fighting skills. A bad cop ends up being the real guilty party and the two stars eventually team up to bring him down but not before many deaths. The fighting sequences are extremely well choreographed and you also feel the passion within the main characters and I think that's what makes the difference in this movie. There is a little humor thrown in as well coming from side characters but mostly the movie is about the action. I'm not usually much for these type of movies but this was so well executed it really surprised me and I couldn't stop watching. Bravo Corey Yuen!!  you took a simple 80's action-revenge movie and made it special despite it's simplicity.
