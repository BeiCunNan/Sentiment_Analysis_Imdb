I watched this movie and totally enjoyed the premise. I have not seen to many movies about pregnant women fighting off the would be baby snatcher. But I was left hanging at the end. No way she could have survived this onslaught to her body without immediate medical help. So flash to what is happening between her and the old guy in car. He picks her up and the story is told to him. He advises her and gives her some guidance as to rationale of both sides involved etc. We never know who he is or where he is taking her. Could the reality of the film be that he is a spiritual envoy taking her soul somewhere because she in actuality died? This is just a thought because otherwise how the heck did she get out of that situation alive. I really deplore movies that have no ending explanation.
