I think the movie Cow Belles is very good! It is about two girls who lost their mother and now live with their father, and they learn the meaning of life by working at the fathers dairy farm! But while working there they go through some rough times..... but together as a family they get through it! I also think this is a really good movie because both Alyson and Amanda M. are very talented not only in acting but singing! I think they were the perfect girls for this movie! This movie is a wonderful, because it teaches you that just because you are rich doesn't mean you get everything you want. So that is why I love this movie so much!!! If you haven't already seen Cow Belles see it and if you have see it again!!!!
