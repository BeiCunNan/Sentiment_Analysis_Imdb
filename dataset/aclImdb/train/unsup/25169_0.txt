Jason Goes To Hell is part 9 of the Friday the 13th series. It is also the worst film of the series. The movie seems to have been improvised from the start to the finish, as the storyline and characters do not make any sense whatsoever. What makes this movie so terrible is that Kane Hodder's portrayal of Jason Voorhees is in the film for about 5 minutes. Did the makers of this film really think that Jason fans would care to see a Jason movie without Jason really being in it? Plus the opening credits in the film last for about 15 minutes! Irritating! Also, the soundtrack sounds like it came from a rejected Disney film. I would strongly recommend not watching this movie at all as it contains no memorable lines, scenes, or characters. Plus, since this is a horror film, horror fans will be disappointed with the uninteresting violence and lack of nudity Jason Goes To Hell has to offer. This film is a complete waste of your time and money.
