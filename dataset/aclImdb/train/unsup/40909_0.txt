Long and flabby, with few originalities into Mozart's life, work, genius. Some primary sources -- ie the letters (all voices are good) -- illuminate the unextraordinary, loving man under the extraordinary artist, but I did not leave knowing him better than before I went in, which anyway is not well.<br /><br />BAD photography.<br /><br />No dramatic momentum. Most interviewees are well-meaning but dull. Sound is lush and clear but the film feels like an amateur filmmaker's labour of love. <br /><br />OK, For $15 and at over three hours, and given the APPALLING low-resolution photography (shot on 1990s Handicam?), I can't recommend this film. Even on daytime TV it will be tedious.
