I'm a Cary Grant fan, and a Hepburn fan, and this film was a chore of 95 minutes to get through. Maybe the worst picture Grant and Hepburn have on their filmographies. Contrived, fake, talky, addled, unfocused, unbelievable, and annoying pretty much sum it up.<br /><br />Grant was of course born and raised in England until his early teens but his cockney accent here drops in and out worse than Kevin Costner's in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves. And he plays an unlikable cad too which just doesn't work for Cary Grant. None of the characters in this are likable in the least. And the film deviates badly between comedy and tragic melodrama.<br /><br />And some of the scenes are just unbelievable. Grant and Hepburn find Edmund Gwenn dead on the rocks, and after a moment of mournful reflection just leave him there and go about their business? Then moments later Brian Aherne's girlfriend is drowning in the surf and is rescued by Hepburn and Edmund Gwenn's body is not seen or mentioned again.<br /><br />But none are more unbelievable than Hepburn playing a boy. She's not convincing whatsoever and so often physically gives you a creepy Michael Jackson vibe.<br /><br />This is one of the very worst films of the 30's.
