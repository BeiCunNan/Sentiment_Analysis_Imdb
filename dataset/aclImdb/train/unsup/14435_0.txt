Just saw this film last night on Sundance and one thing that struck me about this film was the similarity to the works of Dario Argento, even down to the gloved hands of the murderer (albeit white gloves, instead of the black ones in Argento's films), did the director use his hands like Argento does as well? Still one good, if a bit gory, suspense film. I was surprised by the ending and if it is going to be remade in the west, I hope they can get Argento to do it.
