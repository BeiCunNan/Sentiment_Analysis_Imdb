A bullfighting story. Something about Tyrone Power becoming a champion bullfighter and having Linda Darnell as a girlfriend. To be totally honest I only made it through 1 hour of this. I had to turn it off--I kept falling asleep! The story is very dull and the pace of the film is leaden. Also I have no interest in bullfighting so that didn't help. Also I saw a print with horribly faded color--that was REALLY annoying! So, maybe it was that which got to me. Whatever.<br /><br />The two saving graces were Darnell and Power. She's just gorgeous and he is undoubtedly one of the best-looking men ever! Their scenes together did work and they were both very good actors. Still, it wasn't enough to save the film. If you like bullfighting you might get into this. Otherwise, stay away!
