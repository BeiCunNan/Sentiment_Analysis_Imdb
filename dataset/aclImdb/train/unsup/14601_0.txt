Spoiler alert Compared to the original Mimic movie the second part is not a mimic of part one. The movie tells the story of a young teacher and expert in insects, who is looking for someone to love but can't find anybody suitable to her. All the men she meets just seem to be interested in sex then in love. Even her students seem to be more interested in her body than her teaching. Suddenly her persistent admirers are starting to die in gruesome ways and she finds out that there is another candidate, a huge insect, beginning to eliminate the competition and imitating their look an their behaviour to impress the woman. <br /><br />In the final scene we see the insect (once again imitating a human admirer) knocking at her door, flowers in its "hands" and awaiting her to give in. <br /><br />She first carefully touches the spellbound creatures imitated human face in a gently, respectful and hopeful way. Is the only real love she will ever find the love of an insect?<br /><br />But as an expert in these creatures she knows that there is no difference between all the men trying to date with her and this insect - they were all driven by instinct caused by her scent, that there is no love at all - not even in a beauty-and-the-beast drama like this. Then she kills the beast. So the statement of this movie is: there is no love, there are only pheromones!<br /><br />The beauty-and-the-beast-story is a strong movie theme here and compared to part one (which was more an "alien"-like horror-movie) a huge step in developing a mimic-chronic. Unfortunately there's almost no suspense and any situation the characters get in is predictable. The final meeting between the young woman and the creature is without doubt a climax. But these very strong five minutes cannot compare with the rest of a really boring an listless made movie.
