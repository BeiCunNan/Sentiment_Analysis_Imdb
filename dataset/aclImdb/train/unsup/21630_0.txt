Very moving and a beautiful job!! I knew very little about Beah Richards, but this documentary opened my eyes. What an extraordinary and beautiful woman! I commend Lisa Gay Hamilton in taking on the task of putting this altogether.<br /><br />I enjoy every moment from the time the movie started until the time it ended. There's a lot to be learned from here and it's one more reminder of the struggles that were endured during the turn of the 20th century. This movie brought tears to my eyes, something I will never forget.
