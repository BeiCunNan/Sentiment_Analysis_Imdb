If you are easily offended or you plan on watching this with the granny at Christmas, I recommend you don't! The subject matter in this film is as difficult as you can imagine. But if you are a real film buff that loves acting and content of the finest order, then I suggest that you watch this as soon as possible.<br /><br />? is unlike any movie I have ever seen. The dialogue is fantastic and keeps you gripped throughout, but you cant help feeling that you are snooping on the private lives of 2 people that are as mixed up as you can possibly get. Some of the conversations between West and Art feel a bit hard to believe, but somehow that makes the film quirky and highly watchable.<br /><br />This is one of the greatest films ever for people who like weird random comedy, and I repeat, for those who aren't easily offended. It is a uniquely American celebration of in your face humor. A film not to be missed. 9 out of 10.
