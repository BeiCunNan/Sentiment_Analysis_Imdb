Film deals as an asteroid streaks toward a head-on collision with earth and the reaction to impeding doom by means of nuclear bombs(plot posteriorly utilized in blockbuster as ¨Armageddom¨ and ¨Deep impact¨),being assigned for the mission the major (Robert Horton) and commandant(Richard Jaeckel) of a spacial station .They go along for the ride on a strike force to attempt planetary salvation from space.They are going to the satellite to put on nuke charges and blowing up it.They return to the station but have brought aboard the ship a horrible alien monster in shape of green substance that mutate in malevolent tentacled creature that feed energy.Meanwhile both dispute the love of the enticing ship medic(Luciana Paluzzzi).<br /><br />The film is a cheap US-Japanese co-production with lack luster and little budget.Special effects are ridiculous and embarrassing as are the cheesy monsters made with rubber.Aircrafts and spacial station are toys and are made with lousy miniatures.However as the film has tension and suspense is entertained .Besides appear a magnificent secondary actor called Richard Jaeckel(Dirty dozen ,Airplane) and the wonderful Luciana Paluzzi(Thunderball,Chuka).The film is regularly directed by Kinji Fukasuku ,author of some classic sci-fi movie(Virus,Battle Royale). Rating: Below average.
