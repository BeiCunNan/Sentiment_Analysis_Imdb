Well, right now I'm upset. I felt like watching a 90's Bollywood movie today, and could not find my one of my favorites: Baadshah. Maybe I am biased because my favorite actor is in this movie, but let's face it, this is a role that was practically custom-made for him to play, and the supporting cast (Twinkle Khanna and Johnny Lever) have great chemistry with him.<br /><br />Baadshah is a wonderful mix of comedy and drama, and is good for lighthearted fun, although the plot becomes rather fast-paced nearing the end of the movie and some may find it hard to keep up (although I first saw this movie when I was about 10 and I had to read the subtitles, and I followed it fine, so.......) The songs are pretty good, one of my favorites being "Woh Ladki Jo Sab Se", the scene in which Raj- "Baadshah" (Shah Rukh Khan) first starts his job to con Seema (Twinkle Khanna). The movie also plastered with comedic slapstick-type scenes,strongly represented in the scenes where Baadshah upturns his house to convince Seema that he is blind. I feel these are not overdone (though they had the potential) because of the clever lines also sprinkled in between scenes.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a fun, funny Bollywood movie with great songs, good comedy, and talented actors.<br /><br />Now if only I could find that movie again............
