I got this movie in a Troma gift box and it was titled "Video Demons Do Psychotown". Now, judging by the cover and description on the back, about 45 minutes into the movie I thought I may have gotten the wrong disc packaged in my case. So I paused it and looked at the box again. The cover featured a man in a Mohawk popping out of a TV screen and the movie description promised things like "video demons control your every move" and a "gruesome journey into a world of subliminal psychic nightmares". Sure enough there were 3 stills from the flick on the back.<br /><br />In actuality this movie is a boring murder mystery flick about two college students finishing up a documentary for a film school final project. Both leads are wooden and this movie features some lame ass love scenes. There is a lot of talking and repetition none of which builds up to any kind of climax in the end. There are a total of 3 murders and about 4 or 5 love scenes over the course of 90 minutes. That breakdown right there should clue you into what a total snooze-fest this picture is.<br /><br />And Troma, be a little more honest with your packaging. No one likes to be baited and switched like that and it's no wonder why this dud was slipped into the "Toxie's Top Ten" gift box.
