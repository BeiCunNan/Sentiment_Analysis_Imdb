"It's gold, Jerry, gold!" We looked forward to seeing Bee Movie for months, and we were not disappointed. I expected a 'different' kind of story-line from Seinfeld, and, sure enough, the plot included an interesting twist involving bees, a courtroom, and nefarious humans. It seemed to me that the writers took pain to explain (in a comical manner) the intricacies of the bee world, which might enlighten the kiddies somewhat. You don't get that in 'Shrek' or 'Cars', even if those flicks offer a few more belly laughs. I'll trade that off any old time for a film that stimulates the interest of the young ones.<br /><br />I found the movie more 'witty' than hilarious. Seinfeld has surprised me in the past by turning out a show that I didn't 'get' completely the first time - but later I did. There are also a lot of little things going on that only occur to you after a few viewings.<br /><br />Bee movie benefited from some speedy pacing, nifty animation & special effects, fine delivery by Seinfeld, and a great 'performance' by Renée Zellweger. More and more very talented 'acting' is being displayed in animated films these days (wonder, then, if we'll ever see Matthew McConaughey try his hand in this genre?)..<br /><br />All in our Sunday matinée audience had a great time. By the way - 'Bee Movie' and 'Game Plan' were the only 'family' movies at our theater - but there were three 18A gory, violent, obscenity-filled flicks. No PG-13 at all. Thank you, Jerry Seinfeld. Critics: haven't you got a more important job to do?
