if you loved the "wogs" series of the late 80's then you will probably think this is funny as well.<br /><br />Racial stereotypes set in day to day life, if you want to watch something in that sort of vein go watch "Kingswood Country" or for a USA production, "Married with children" or "SOAP".<br /><br />If the producers were trying to turn away potential immigrants then they have a hit production, this would turn me away if I was foreign born and saw this as what Australian's were like. <br /><br />It's as funny as Barry Humphries' Dame Edna character, and has as much to do with Australian life as Dame Edna does.<br /><br />do yourself a favor, if you find it funny, go see a psychiatrist?
