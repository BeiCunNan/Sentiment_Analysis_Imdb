i didn't like the original Texas chain saw massacre, or poltergeist, but tobe hooper really out did himself in toolbox murders. the acting was really good. for once the people were smart , so was the killer. it had a great story behind it, i would give it 3 1/2 stars, but - 1/2 for the gore and violence. i usually like the gore parts so + 1/2 but it looked a tiny bit fake so - 1/2. = 3 / 4. but plus 1/4 for Angela Bettis's + the killer's acting = 3 1/4. it was over all very creepy, but a little predictable, still really good. it had few weak spots, probably the only one was ned. he was creepy, but not so good at acting. the script and music were good, so was the way it was shot, and the way the building looked. they made the building look so creepy, like there had to be something inside it that was evil. 9/10
