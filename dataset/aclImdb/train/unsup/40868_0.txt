I am a HUGE fan of spoof movies. Naked Gun series, Fatal Instinct, Wrongfully Accused, Scary Movie series, Date Movie, and Not Another Teen Movie are all movies I watch on a regular basis. According to the commercials, this was going to be another one to add to my collection.....WRONG!!!! I was so disgusted. I kept waiting for a payoff, something, anything. It was so flat, even the actors seemed embarrassed. Obviously the studio was planning on hyping the movie knowing that the first weekend is all the movie was going to have. Yes, there were a few (and I do mean a few) funny parts, but this entire movie could have been condensed into a MadTV skit that would have been just perfect. I literally fell asleep during the movie. Now, how many people do you know that fall asleep during a "comedy"? I absolutely will not be attending another movie from these guys until after the first few weekends. I know if you were like me you would have to go see it for yourself and make your own determination, but please, I beg you, do not see this movie, do not buy or rent the DVD. If we support garbage like this, they will continue to rush out these terrible movies hoping that dopes like me will rush out on opening day to see them. We need to send a message. I know they made the entire investment back the first weekend, but good god almighty.
