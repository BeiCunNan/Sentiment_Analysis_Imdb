This movie isn't bad. In fact, I thought it was pretty good.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Federal Marshall Jack La Roca (Lou Diamond Phillips) who is after a fugitive on the run named "Rabbit" (Steven Williams) who just happens to have made a stop on Route 66.<br /><br />Now they must transport Rabbit from Arizona to California in the next ten hours. But, they decide to take a shortcut through Route 666.<br /><br />I don't know about you but if I saw a route with the number 666, I would avoid it. I am not a superstitious man but I would just avoid a road like that.<br /><br />Anyways, back to the story. They decide to take the route and they are stalked by four ghouls. All four of them were the most psychotic prisoners of the 1960s who used to work digging ditches and died.<br /><br />The four ghouls each have a weapon they use to kill people. One has a sledgehammer, the second has a pick ax, the third is equipped with a large chain, and the fourth is equipped with a jackhammer.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert* <br /><br />While one of the ghouls yanks the person off their feet with the chain, the second and third then proceed to stab and smash with their sledgehammer and pick ax. When it's time to go for the kill, the fourth person kills by drilling the person to death with his jackhammer.<br /><br />*End Spoiler* <br /><br />Later in the film, you find out one of the killers was Jack La Roca's father. Who, coincidentally, has the same name as his son.<br /><br />The story is pretty good. I liked the twist at the end. There is a little gore but that is fine. Lou Diamond Phillips is great in films like this.<br /><br />If you are a Lou Diamond Phillips fan, I would recommend you pick this up.<br /><br />I give this movie 7 stars out of 10. Not as bad as people make it out to be!
