the only redeeming thing about this movie is the background music. Not even Carlos Ponce could save this movie! It is a horrible vehicle for a couple of Latin music's up and coming, or more accurately, wanna be's, and I would strongly recommend you buy a copy of Playboy/playgirl if all you want is eye candy. This is an insult to women, particularly Latin women and the stereo types in this movie set women and Latinos back at least 20 years. Oh, Cisco, Oh Pancho! Not much better than that. Save your money - I'm grateful I got to see if for free or I would have asked for my money back. I wouldn't even rent this for my worst enemy - and if offered a free copy, I would refuse.
