With the latest revival in horror flicks, you would at least expect decent movies, since they make a lot of money these days.<br /><br />But 'Abominable" proofs that turkeys still exist in the genre. Everything is wrong:<br /><br />-the acting is terrible, especially the female lead is painfully to watch. -the dialog is cheesy: remember when they talk about their past right after a murder with the beast out there ? Oh God... -the lame story rips off Hitchcock's Rear Window and even... Mimic 3. Go figure.. -the creature is something to laugh at. Never scary or anything. -no frights, no suspense, murders appear mostly off-screen.<br /><br />You can mix horror with humor, like Lake Placid, which worked out great. But this one is not meant to be funny. Avoid at all cost.
