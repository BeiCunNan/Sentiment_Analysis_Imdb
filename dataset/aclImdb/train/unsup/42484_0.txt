When I first knew that French Stewart was playing Inspector Gadget, I thought, "great!". The cartoon Inspector Gadget had the voice, quirkiness and Klutziness that French Stewart had in his character of Harry from Third Rock From The Sun. Whan I watched Third Rock From the Sun before this sequel of Inspector Gadget came out, I thought Harry sounded just like Inspector Gadget. I thought when I saw the first version, he would have played a much better character than Matthew Broderick. Later, I was excited when I learned French had been cast for the role. However, my excitement turned to disappointment during the first few minutes of Inspector Gadget 2. Harry was more the Inspector Gadget character than the Inspector Gadget he played in this movie. He seems sedated, on a heavy dose of sleep inducing tranquilizers. If he had only played his "Harry" character in Inspector Gadget 2, French Stewart could've been a good Inspector Gadget. The film is bland, the story is dumb and boring. It's not worth the time to waste watching any of it.
