I know that it takes a lot of people and a lot of work to make a film, but this film is absolutely horrendous. Only thing good is the costumes. This is the only film to date where I have actually walked out of the theatre in the middle of it.<br /><br />Bottom line...big pile o' pooey. PLEASE don't waste your time.
