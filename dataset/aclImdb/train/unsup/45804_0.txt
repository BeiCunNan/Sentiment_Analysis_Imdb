I could easily go into a detailed rant about the way they chose to end this thing. But I would rather let everyone see the TV movie. And come to their own conclusions. What I would like to say is, that I lived and breathed Adrian Paul's Highlander. Bought memorabilia. Hoped for the end to be worth the time spent. And I would rather have had the last motion picture be the the final chapter of this saga. Then to be set up for a huge let down the way I was. In my opinion "The Source" is the worst piece of garbage I have seen in many years. And it was very uncomfortable to see a beloved character like Duncan. End up in a movie that was like the "Power Rangers" on crack. I could barely sit through the whole thing. And I quickly erased it from my DVR. Before the credits rolled. What was the purpose of having Duncan. If all of his lives and loves ended miles from the mark? I am more than angry and disappointed. And seriously thinking of putting all my Highlander keepsakes on Ebay, and be done with it. This piece of trash was an insult to Highlander fans. And Adrian Paul should have had more self respect, than to even think about letting Duncan fizzle out this way. The concept was someone's drug induced nightmare. Pure crap!
