This movie is extremely horrible except for one line that Hav says. The line is said while she is talking on the phone to someone. She says: "Do I look like a biscuit? Do I look like a biscuit to you? Do I look like a french fry? Then why you treatin me like a side order!"<br /><br />Oh good lord this line is hilarious.
