It is a refreshing comedy to see, as the other scary movies, yet this film is much different than the others. There is not as much of the David Zucker "one liners" you would expect, a hint of the Wayans brothers mixed in, and a lot of the jokes run flat. One of the key problems with the film was that they tried to mix too many parodies into it, which took away from the story, and at times seemed just like one big jumble of plot lines and stories.<br /><br />However, having said that I would like to say that there are some hilarious moments and lines in the film which make it worth seeing. Especially if you are a fan of film such as airplane and the naked gun movies, there are still plenty of moments in it. The comedy style of this film is much like Hotshots Part Deux, yet doesn't quite reach the level of genius which that film did
