This isn't my typical movie genre. I am more interested in character drama than action movies. This is able to span both genres in a way that Hollywood hasn't managed to accomplish. The plot was interesting and the acting by Anne Parillaud was exceptional.<br /><br />I had seen the American remake, called "Point of No Return" and found it to be an OK movie, but I wanted to see the original. I am glad that I did. The technical aspects of direction and editing are very good. The plot was interesting - revolving around the timeless theme of redemption. The acting made this an exceptional movie.<br /><br />For fans of the action genre, they will be quite happy. For those like myself who are more interested in character and plot-driven movies may find this to be a pleasant surprise as well.
