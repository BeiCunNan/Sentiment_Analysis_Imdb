The TV guide described this as " Fast and furious " , well I`d describe this film as diahorrea because it`s fast and furious faeces . I wasn`t expecting it to be up to much but I was shocked as to what a poor film RANGERS is<br /><br />****** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ******* But don`t worry you won`t want to see this movie<br /><br />The film starts with an airborne shot of a hercules C-130 then it cuts to the interior of the plane - Which in no way resembles a C-130 , It resembles a gym changing room ! - where we`re introduced to the characters in some of the most painful exposition I`ve seen of having the leader discuss what the mission is and why they`re all wearing Syrian army uniforms.<br /><br />Cut to some stock footage of men skydiving from a plane at dawn and then landing into the sea where they inflate a couple of rubber dingys underwater then cut to them resurfacing where it`s pitch black ! Some team of special forces if it takes them all day to inflate a couple of dingys . And wouldn`t the delta force or navy SEALS be doing this sort of stuff ? I`m just kind of curious why this film is called RANGERS ?<br /><br />So they carry on with their mission which confused me because if they`re posing as Syrians then that can only mean the action is taking place in Syria or the Lebanon ,neither country being at war so why`s this taking place in the middle of a war zone ? It gets worse though because one of the team says :<br /><br />" This jobs easier than that twenty buck hoe I had in Las Vegas "<br /><br />Yup there`s nothing more endearing to an audience than knowing one of the heroes has to pay for sex . In fact would a prostitute in Vegas be charging as little as twenty bucks ? Shows you how bad a film like RANGERS is when you find yourself asking questions like that .<br /><br />Enough . I could spend several pages writing about this piece of garbage but it`s not worth it . It`s a cheap straight to video film composed of stock footage and a bunch of non actors giving the impression they`re making the story up as they go along . I won`t finish on the old cliche that I wasted ninety minutes of my life on this crap because I only wasted thirty minutes of my life on it as I turned it off when the guy got blown out of the window
