This movie is one of the best out there, I've rented the movie so many times I ended up just buying the video. I love the segue of how they start in the beginning with how we broke the sound barrier to the advent of the space program. The direction of the film was incredible too. Take the time to rent this legendary film, you'll be happy you did!
