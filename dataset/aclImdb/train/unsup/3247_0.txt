Fl√•klypa Grand Prix is the best film in Norway ever. And if anyone wonders where "Star Wars: Episode One" has got their racing theme from just look at FGP :) In the racing scene you first have an outstander that want to be racing in his own machine. And there has ofcourse been some sabotage on the machine he is driving that occours later in the race. In the race you have spectacular camera-views that makes you dizzy and you feel like your inside the machine. And after he almost loose the race because of the engine trouble he suddenly got the machine together and wins the race in the last second. Any other that see the similarity ? :)<br /><br />Otherwise FGP is outstanding animated and is the best of Caprino's animated films.<br /><br />
