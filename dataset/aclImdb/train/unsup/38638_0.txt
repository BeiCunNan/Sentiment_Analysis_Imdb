2 marks for acting quite well Ms Jolie Pitt but minus 10 for taking on a story that is only there to glorify YOU. There is no point to this movie - we saw it all on the news 1000 times better. We get what we really want to know about this from news not movies. The widow of Pearl has a big problem too as far as I see it - why would ANYONE want the life of their executed husband made into a Hollywood movie? Starring a mega glamorous star as oneself? It is sick if you ask me. Well no one asked me and all the other sensible people in the world so meanwhile the Jolie Pitts, the Clooneys, the Bonos, the Bob Geldorfs etc etc of this world go around wasting TONS of money for pointless films and concerts on the pretence of illuminating the world about all the bad things happening and actually are just on a MASSIVE ego trip about themselves. It is shameful.
