I saw this movie when it was first released and I was so excited about it because of the profound effect the books had had on me. Unfortunately, the movie was an absolute travesty and whoever passed the script as OK should be ashamed of themselves. It's the worst adaptation of a book I've ever seen! The only thing I really liked about the movie were the sets. The bedroom looked just as I imagined it would! However I felt that the movie had been totally miscast and the storyline had been butchered. I don't know whether I'd like a re-make or not - what if it was even worse? Just as an aside, one of my exam questions years ago was to compare a book and a movie adaptation and I chose this one because I felt so strongly about it. Just wish I had a copy of the essay lol - I'm sure it was a masterpiece :D
