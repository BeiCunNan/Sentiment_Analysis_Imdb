The Calcium kid is about as bad as they get. The script is full of holes and aside from simply not making much sense, tends to do that thing where in order for plot twists to work everyone would have to be a complete idiot. The jokes, if that is what they were meant to be, are like beached dead jelly fish - lifeless and limp. The characters are annoying enough that you'll be reaching for the remote to fast forward through various scenes - once the originality of their British accents loses its appeal. The writer obviously equated - greedy, annoying == funny. Which, it doesn't. There is a reason why you didn't see this one at the movies.
