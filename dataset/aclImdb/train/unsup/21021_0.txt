This had to be one of the most unethical movies I've ever seen. The best movies are the ones that make you think about about their message afterward (debate over the premises and conclusion) or the movies that tell their story in a captivating way; Boondock Saints did none of that. It was built up to be just like a Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs but it doesn't come close to those two classics. This movie's underlying message, if universalized, is "anyone who is perceived as bad should be killed in the name of God"; seems to be the same logic that any terrorist would use. It's sick to think that people condone the killing that occurs in this movie. A person may try to argue that any superhero acts in this way but a spiderman, batman, or superman all help people that need it at that time; they also never execute people.
