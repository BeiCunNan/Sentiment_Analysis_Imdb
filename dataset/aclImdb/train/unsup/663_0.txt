In the forest of Asturias, some horrible killings have altered the quiet existence of the zone inhabitants. Manuel works as a seller and he is used to walk through this dangerous paths. Anyway, he seems to keep a deep secret in relation to the deaths. This movie claims to be based upon reals things, (a lycantrop that lived at the end of XIX century, and maybe due to this reason it is not as much exaggerated as much other terror films that are usually made. Curiously it is quite loyal to the truth, which is unusual in this kind of film. Anyway, despite the feeling of a sick atmosphere is quite well done, neither the actors nor the history have the thrilling emotion that this kind of movies should have to be interesting. Sometimes boring, it is not one of the best films I've seen lately. It has a good setting (a curious plot and a well scenario), but the directing is not as good as it should, be, which is bad for the film in the whole.
