Even after all these years, Magical Mystery Tour still ranks as one of the worst I've ever sat through. OK, it had the Beatles in it (but you already knew that). OK, the soundtrack is fantastic (but you already knew that). And Magical Mystery Tour is 1967 wildly creative (but you probably already knew that). I won't gush on about how groundbreaking the Beatles were time after time (again, you already knew that). I love their music and other movies.<br /><br />Magical Mystery Tour is unfathomably awful. It has the look and feel of a home movie, and like most home movies, it's pointless, except perhaps as an example of pure self indulgence by a bunch of rich spoiled musicians. It's bad - really bad, but it isn't fun bad like Plan 9 from Outer Space. I saw Magical Mystery Tour in college at a bar, where they put a pitcher of cheap draft in front of you and then started the 16mm projector. I'm not sure during which part I downed the beer, but it didn't help.<br /><br />The full Beatles group never released a less than stellar LP (or if they did, I've never heard of it), although "Two Virgins" by John Lennon and Yoko Ono is arguably the vinyl equivalent to this drek.
