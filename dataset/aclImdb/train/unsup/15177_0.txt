This movie was better than I expected, given the harsh but unsubstantiated reviews here.<br /><br />The acting and dialogue were better than I expected from such a low-budget, quick shoot. The script was so-so, but I accept that. I don't need to be taught lessons, just have the story be interesting and coherent. Perhaps they could have taken a page out of Strangers With Candy and been blunt about the lessons they learned; perhaps even learned the wrong lessons? <br /><br />Contrary to most, I thought Marco Dapper delivered an acceptable, but not great, performance. He was definitely cast in this movie for his looks.<br /><br />I thought Brett Chukerman really mastered the role of confident guy on the prowl for his next conquest as he teased Troy while changing for art class in the restroom. Andrew Ley's brief appearance in the opening scene really impressed me as well.<br /><br />The stereotypical flaming art instructor was a throw-away role, nothing to get upset over. Emily Brooke Hands was fairly convincing as being interested in her art. Rebekah Kochan fared better than I thought she might in the role of the self-proclaimed slut. A good cast, for what this movie was.<br /><br />As for those who think this flick gives the so-called "gay community" a bad name, not to worry: the gay community determines how it is perceived all by itself. I don't see people bashing the "straight community" because married men cheat on their wives left and right. Men like sex, whatever their persuasion. This movie presents the lengths to which some might go to get it.<br /><br />Speaking of which...if you watch this in the theater, be sure to stay all the way to end after the final credits roll. There is a gratuitous titillating surprise for you, although you might have trouble standing up when the lights pop up.
