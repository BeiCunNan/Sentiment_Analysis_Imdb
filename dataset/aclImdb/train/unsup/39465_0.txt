Grizzly Rage starts as four young high school friends Lauren (Kate Todd), Wes (Tyler Hoechlin), Sean (Graham Kosakoski) & Rich (Brody harms) embark on a celebratory 4x4 off road drive through some woods but decide to do their thing on private property. While racing around the woods in their 4x4 jeep they accidentally hit & kill a young Grizzly Bear cub & crash their jeep in the process, idiots. Lauren is gutted about the Grizzly Bear but what the hell, then suddenly the four friends find out that the young (dead) Bear's mother is around & very angry at the four friends for killing her kid & sets out to kill them all in a Grizzly rage...<br /><br />Apparently also known as Off Road in Canada this awful Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' was directed by the generally untalented low budget film auteur David DeCoteau (despite having nearly 80 directorial credits to his name you can count his good films on one hand) & is as bad as all the IMDb user comments & the low 2.5 IMDb user rating would suggest. Part of the 'Man Eater' series my heart sank as soon as I saw Robert Halmi Sr. & Jr.'s names on the credits as they are responsible for many an awful tame made-for-telly creature feature of the most routine kind. Grizzly Rage lacks any excitement, pace, tension or decent set-pieces & the four main character's are all idiots. There's one scene in particular that stunned me, it's just after the first attack when Rich is killed & as Wes drives the jeep away next to a sheer drop & Sean grabs the steering wheel & they have a struggle which sends the jeep over the edge of the small cliff & causing themselves all sorts of problems. It's just such a stupid scene that makes no sense & after Wes & Sean don't even argue about it, no offense but I would have killed Sean myself. Then there's the ending which feels like it has five minutes missing & a plot that doesn't make any sense with the main character's splitting up (when Sean decides to run for help why didn't all three just go?) & at the end when they have the killer Bear trapped they hold hands & walk away very, very slowly (running would be a good idea at that point, no?) & for some strange reason a local lake is full of toxic waste barrels which is mentioned & seen but never comes to anything & is totally forgotten about almost as soon as they are introduced. At 85 odd minutes Grizzly Rage is a real chore to sit through & some of the dialogue is awful too with Lauren's confession about hitting a neighbour's car both funny & somewhat pointless. The list of things wrong with Grizzly Rage is never ending & it's the sort of film you could pick holes in all day long, as bad as Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Features' go & believe me they can be bad.<br /><br />Another huge problem with Grizzly Rage is that the suppose threat just comes across as really tame, the Bear never really does anything other than stand on it's hind legs & there's this obviously dubbed roaring noise even though you can clearly see the Bear is just not angry or aggressive. When it attacks Lauren & Wes in the jeep instead of turning it over why doesn't it stick it's arms inside the clearly broken windows & slash them with it's claws? The film introduces a random run down house (character's in these types of films always find a random run down house don't they?) that looks like it belongs in Wrong Turn (2003) or something & since DeCoteau like to fill his films with homo-erotic vibes (out of four main character's three of them are young fit blokes & only one lady) the leading man at the end takes all his clothes off expect his boxer shorts for reasons that are flimsy at best. There's zero gore either, there are a few CGI blood splatters but nothing else. Talking of CGI Grizzly rage is maybe the only modern 'Creature Feature' I have seen not to use any for it's main threat, in this case either a real Bear was used or a guy in a bad Bear suit.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $2,000,000 I can't see where the money went, shot on location in Winnipeg, Manitoba in Canada the music is awful as is the whole production. The acting is pretty bad, the cast try but they just come across as looking silly.<br /><br />Grizzly rage is the sort of Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' that typifies everything bad about the genre, this is just awful in every regard really & the overall negative comments from people here on the IMDb are wholly justified here. Watch the original killer Grizzly Bear flick Grizzly (1976) instead.
