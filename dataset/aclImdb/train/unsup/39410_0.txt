I have to agree with the first comment, because this movie was nothing special. I have read both the novel and seen the movie and the novel is much better. The movie does have exceptional actors, but it has all the wrong actors for all the wrong parts. The novel was based back in the racial segregation days, and the movie hardly captured a glimpse of the racism in the novel. Janie, the main character was played by Halie Barry, however I think that she was the wrong actor for the part of Janie. Janie was described as the tragic hero of the novel, who was also dim witted and beautiful. Halie Barry definitely revealed Janies Beauty, however Mrs. Barry was much to "snappy" and intelligent to play Janie. <br /><br />The novel did however capture the "black" town of Eatonville exceptionally well. The "southern bells" of the town were played perfectly, and the attitude of the town was the same as that described in the book. Janies husband, Jody, was an OK actor, but he didn't really capture the true depth that was described in the novel. Tea Cake however, was an exceptional actor, who definitely captured the puppy love between him and Janie, and the cocky attitude that was described in the novel. Overall, the book is much better than the movie.
