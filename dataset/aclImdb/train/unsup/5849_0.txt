The Apostle is an amazing film. It takes the subject of faith, within the specific realm of the Pentecostal church, and gives it the grime and grit of humanity. It does not make the faithful out to be angels nor does it portray the non-believers as demons. It takes the main teaching of the Christian faith, that we are all sinners yet through Jesus Christ we are all forgiven, and paints an eloquent story of a real man's faith and how difficult it can be to believe so powerfully. Bobby Duvall is spectacular in a role that must have been important to him. All the technical aspects of the film follow in the footsteps of the fantastic script. The cinematography is beautiful as are the rich southern locations. The actors that comprise the congregation are all so full of life that it makes one wonder if they are acting at all. The opening scene where Sonny, Mr. Duvall's character, stops at the scene of an accident to be with a dying man is sublime. I highly recommend this film especially for anyone of any faith that appreciates the power of faith and spirituality.
