Not that it didn't have its moments, but this is definitely one that should have gone directly to video. It just seems very poorly made. This movie also has Sherman Hemslely in a rather large role so once I saw that flash on the screen, I knew the film would be kind of generic. Still I like Norm MacDonald and he does his best, though he doesn't have much to work with. This movie has a butler who kidnaps his boss's dog, but the dog goes away. The police find a ransom note and Norm's blood everywhere and think he is the one who was kidnapped. There is a twist at the end anyone will see a mile away and there are some humorous scenes with Danny DeVito, but for the most part I wouldn't look too hard to find this movie.
