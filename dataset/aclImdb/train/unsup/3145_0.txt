I first saw the movie Young Sherlock Holmes several years ago and totally enjoyed it. I have faced great power struggles within the school administrations here in the United States and it sort of reminded me of it. Sherlock (Nick Rowe) demonstrated great courage, stamina, intellect, and athletic ability to overcome the evil forces that surrounded him.<br /><br />I was disappointed to find that Nicholas Rowe has not been featured in other adventure movies. It is a shame for such talent to go to waste. I hope to see more of him in the future what ever role he is offered to act.<br /><br />What do you think? Kevin Kazakevich
