How on earth do movies like this get made? Is it like... "Hey! I've got a few hundred thousand to spare. Let's write a lame script with lots of bad dialogue, hire dozens of mediocre actors and throw in a bunch of stupid special effects! What a great idea!"<br /><br />There many scenes and lines that were just pointless. There were just there to fill up time. Then there was the lame 'B' plot about (plot spoiler again) the secret goverment agency trying to get their hands on the aliens. The whole development of this plot is little more than "I can't let the good guys destroy the monster, because then the aliens won't come down. And I must have the aliens. Bwahahah."<br /><br />Huh?<br /><br />
