I can't tell you how many times I have seen the C.N Tower in this movie. Even thought this movie was shot in Toronto, it was taking place in Chicago. I think editing was horrible. Viewers see "Toronto Sun" newspaper boxes, and there was a scene with a Canadian flag draped over a park, and my gosh, the downtown Toronto skyline is very noticable in some scenes. To top things off the acting was horrific. Jennifer Lopez should stay away from scripts as she possibally can. She deserves a razzy award.
