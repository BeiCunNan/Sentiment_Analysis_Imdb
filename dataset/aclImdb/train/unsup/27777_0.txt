Of course it was cheesy. They all are; but it was very entertaining. I loved the beginning when the old man got fried. I thought the movie was well done, except they did the behemoth in a little too easy. I guess they were running into time constrictions. The submarine was a little sub-par for chasing a sea monster. They were lucky they didn't take a nose dive just going out in the water with it. It's too bad they didn't have the behemoth escape and come back in a sequel to commit more carnage on the human species! I dream of the day when someone with a brain remakes this with modern techniques without ruining the movie as they did with Godzilla. Besides that, I love the name: THE GIANT BEHEMOTH!!!
