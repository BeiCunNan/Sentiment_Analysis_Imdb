To the people who hate this movie because it presents an unrealistic idea - please. Grow up. It's a movie. Do you hate Dragonball Z because it presents an unrealistic idea of aliens that are human-like in appearance and speak English? Your critiques are pitiful on their face.<br /><br />With that being said, "Indigo" is an entertaining movie with a good script that could have done with a bit more coherence. The direction felt somewhat like the movie was done for fun and not as a piece of art, which is both a good and a bad thing. The acting, while amateurish, actually works for the story that the movie presents. The scenario of the road trip is a comfortable one for movie watchers, and it works here. I think what I liked the best about the movie, though, is that it leads you to believe that it's going to end in a violent way and ends up not doing so. That disappoints a lot of people, but I think it was a perfect way to end the movie. And whether or not you believe in the whole "indigo child" thing, this movie is worth watching. I hope future projects from these filmmakers have tighter writing, though.
