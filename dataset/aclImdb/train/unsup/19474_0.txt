I hired his movie in pure interest of what a movie would look like on a budget of 10 cents. And this movie looks like it got a budget of 5 cents. The directing, editing and especially the acting are SHOCKING!! Not to mention that stupid music score that drains the talking and above all is sooo repetitive!!<br /><br />minus**** out of ****<br /><br />
