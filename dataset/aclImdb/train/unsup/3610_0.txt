I thought that it was almost as if they had started on a movie and then midway decided to change the plot. The idea is great but it did look like the script was struggling to convey the idea of time travel. I thought that they should have stuck with the satellite part (and made it more convincing)... As far as the acting is concerned, some was good and some was terrible. I thought that Denzel Washington was doing more posing than acting, as if he thought that he was auditioning for '24' or 'Zoolander'. You also get the feeling that it was designed to be part of a sequel franchise. The best thing about it are the special effects.
