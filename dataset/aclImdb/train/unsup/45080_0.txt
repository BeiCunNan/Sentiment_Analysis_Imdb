Pluto Nash is one of those films that wouldn't have been so bad - if it had been done 25 years ago with no stars and a smaller budget.<br /><br />Now we have Eddie Murphy and a whole bunch of, albeit not A-list, solid supporting actors (Rosario Dawson excluded) aimlessly wandering about from one pointless scene to another. Part camp, part thriller, part adventure, part comedy, part sci-fi, part action part romance... and it still amounts to nothing.<br /><br />Everything just falls flat, and when you see the result you can't help wondering what the actors were thinking as they acted out their scenes. Obviously, it must have been a case of monetary issues - and there's nothing wrong with making money, but it doesn't make it a good, or even entertaining film.<br /><br />Eddie Murphy seems determined to ruin his career with utter crap like this. I mean, here we have a film that decides to take time out from the action to let the audience gawk at a french maid robot getting gradually undressed. If only the same level of attention had been given to the script as to the aforementioned robot's knickers and bra, then maybe it would have been less pointless. Still, the music was kind of catchy... [1/10]
