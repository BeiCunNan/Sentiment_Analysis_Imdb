This is the best performance by Cher I have seen. One the best movies by all actors. Very realistic!!! I really don't understand why you need to have ten lines if you just want to make a statement about a movie that you really enjoyed. So here goes...I think the Cramps are a really great band, if you ever go on YouTube check it out. My African Cichlids just a babies we were afraid that the little sucker was going to die, he made it through about three days and he is growing stronger and bigger. My super, smoking, sexy, hot boyfriend made two turkeys today we have yet to eat them....smells good, also mashed potatoes, stuffing with sausage, greens beans, nice rolls and butter and we didn't even need gravy in a can...homemade gravy. Oh, by the way Mask was a great movie and totally recommend it.
