I saw this film at a screening in LA recently and truly enjoyed it. Genuine and full of heart, and I thought the acting was terrific. I don't know why Danny Aiello hasn't had more leading roles before this, and I was impressed by Jane Curtain in a drama since she's really only been in comedies, like SNL. Once I was immersed in the story, I really felt for these characters, and I could definitely identify with the son's conflicted feelings of loyalty towards his dad and his dad's business. No matter what happens, you will always love your parents, but often times there are things about them that drive you crazy and make you swear you'll never be like them. I thought this movie was well-written -- the dialogue seemed like conversations between real people, not trite like a lot of Hollywood movies. Nice to see an indie that you can actually relate to.
