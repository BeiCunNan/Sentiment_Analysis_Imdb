I loved this movie, as will any fan of Roy Dupuis, best known for his role of 'Michael' in the TV series "La Femme Nikita." Sure, it's over the top at times, but it's supposed to be; it's a farce. I had a great time watching Roy's character, Dominique Samson, trying to avoid being caught in his own web of innuendos and half-truths he has spun and keeps spinning in order to keep his job. The confrontation with his wife when she learns of his "alternate lifestyle" is priceless. Patrick Huard, who plays Dominique's friend, business partner, and "lover," is terrific. His presence is supposed to help Dominique from being hit on or picked up by other men, but he does everything he can to exacerbate Dominique's predicament. Roy Dupuis gets in some great throw-away lines. Although we don't often get to see him in comedies, he does an excellent job in this movie. The single off-note is Dominique's mother, who is thrilled to learn that her son is in touch with his feminine side, read "gay." The subplot reinforces the main storyline, but it's a little too much to be believable. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is in the mood for a good laugh
