This is definitely the best romantic comedy that I have seen in the past several years. Great writing, solid acting and delivery, excellent production values. The dialog was fresh and edgy, and it was the first film that I have seen in a while that felt like it was written and directed by real people, and not vetted by a series of industry drones. The dramatic aspects of the film were familiar and yet not predictable. The women in the film were much more progressive and real than are typical in larger budget studio productions, and the portrayal of sex and sexuality was downright honest. The cast was obviously enjoying themselves, and stayed on task to deliver excellent performances. I really appreciated that it actually dealt with some real content and issues, but wrapped in a warm and fuzzy bubble-gum Saturday night eye-candy teen-Disney kind of context. I'm surprised that this wasn't snatched up by a distributor (note to distributors - snatch this up before the bidding war begins).
