This may be unfair because we only watched the first 25 minutes of this movie. I am the kind of person who NEVER turns off movies I've paid for, but this was a first. Not only were we so disgusted with the movie we turned it off not even half-way through, we went out and rented another to get the memory of this movie out of our minds. This was a great story idea gone very, very bad with HORRIBLE acting, bad camera work, and script caliber of no more than USA Up All Night. <br /><br />
