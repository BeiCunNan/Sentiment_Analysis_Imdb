German produced horror. Directed and written by Anthony Hickox. Not exactly interesting, so it really takes an effort to sit through this. Some preppy students are lured into a neighborhood wax museum. Some veteran actors lend their talents, half heartedly I would imagine. This is just not intense enough for me. If you like bland horror...relax and enjoy.<br /><br />Cast members: Zach Galligan, Deborah Foreman, Michelle Johnson, Patric Macnee, John Rhys-Davies and Miles O'Keeffe. Kudos to the set designers that provide at least an anxious atmosphere.
