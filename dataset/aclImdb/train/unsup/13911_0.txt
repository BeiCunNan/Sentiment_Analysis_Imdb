I had no expectations whatsoever of this movie when my family and I sat down to watch it.<br /><br />I was blown away. We thought it was brilliant, from start to finish. I also felt the animation was of a very high standard and it evoked memories of the original film.<br /><br />Everyone at Disney who were involved in creating this film should be very, very proud of themselves. They did a fine job. I could be wrong, of course, but I just felt that this was a labour of love for the creators and their care and artistry just oozes out of every frame of this movie.<br /><br />Easily the best of the direct-to-video sequels.
