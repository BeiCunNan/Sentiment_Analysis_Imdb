The movie contains what seems to be an honest look at a missionary leaving his home for quite a while, not knowing what to expect, and, returning home unexpectedly different. I thought the movie was tastefully done. I didn't have a lot of preconceived notions going in, and was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. I thought the storyline showed some of the greatest human characteristics that can be shown, both from Elder Groberg and from those whom he served. I recommend the movie to anyone I see...and really don't understand why anyone would say it's "the worst movie ever" seeing some of the bile that's put on film each and every day.<br /><br />If you're looking for shoot-em-up and special effects, this is the worst movie ever. If you're looking for an inspiring story that gets you asking what's really important in life, then you may put this on your ten-best list. Happy viewing!
