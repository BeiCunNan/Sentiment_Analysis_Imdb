Wow. Just wow.<br /><br />I don't think I have ever been touched more by a Narf. This movie is perhaps the greatest portrayal of grass ape monkeys in trees that I have ever seen. That alone deserves some respect. The people in charge of the introduction were pretty good too; I am sure many will be touched by their crayola skills. <br /><br />Let the eagle soar, soar as high as she has never soared before. Or so we thought. With a wingspan larger than Jesus on the cross, the Eagle of the Narf is a beautiful creature, zipping through the skies of the Fruity Pebble Interpreter's vision led by the Guild of Seven with the healer of the Narf. Que Pasa? Que bueno. This movie also had the best portrayal of an overbearing Asian mom with a daughter "who like tell bed time story to you". Only after drinking milk and pissing your pants, though.
