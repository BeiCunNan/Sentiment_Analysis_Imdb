This film could have drove it's "point" home a lot better than presented. It should have stayed CLEAR away from the feel of the 70's type "blaxpoitation" films. But this film was not so bad at all.<br /><br />It tells a story, a story of a big time 70's guy who's soul has not been put to rest. He has a vendetta, dead or not, he needed to see it to its full completion. (Ya know, similar to George W. Bush and his Iraq thing.)<br /><br />Ernest Dickerson is a darn excellent cinematographer and director of photography. In the 80's I enjoyed his work on "Tales From The Darkside" and I can see he was headed for it here. Trouble is, in feature film, audiences expect more. Progression is the key, and Ernest went for a 70's blaxpoitation thing here instead of just telling the tale as it should be.<br /><br />Snoop Dog actually did a good job for the material here. If nothing else, this was his audition tape for the feature film: "Starsky and Hutch".<br /><br />The stereotypical parts for the other actors is what turned me off. (Turned me off in the 70's as well.) which is why this film could have done without it.<br /><br />But it is an entertaining film. Good for your adult Halloween Party if everyone there is over 35 to recall the movie days of "Foxy Brown", "Blacula" and "Black Cesear".
