I wasn't excepting anything special before I started to watch "Plata quemada". I just knew that it was an Argentinean movie and it has won the Goya price. Only good movies win this price. After the beginning of the movie (the underground scene) I thought that it would be another stupid gay romance. Later, step by step, the movie became more and more interesting. Great plot, excellent actors (and actress), wonderful music. As one of the IMDb users says, Eduardo Noriega's acting is similar to the River Phoenix's one. For example in "My private Idaho". Who knows if his voices were symptoms of mental defect or small epileptic fits etc.? When the movie was ending I was thinking that it was one of the best movies I had ever seen. But when appeared the information that it was based on a true story my breath was taken away. Next half an hour, I was not able to do anything, except to think about the movie. I reacted this way just when I had seen "Dancer in the dark". It is not one of the best movies I have ever seen, but the best one ever.
