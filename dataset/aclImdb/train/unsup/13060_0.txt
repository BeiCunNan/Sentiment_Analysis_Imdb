The MacDowell/Quaid marriage seems like it is already on the rocks from the beginning. Quaid seems to make an attempt but MacDowell never does give her husband any softness except during the final scene when she asks him to talk to her.<br /><br />Collet and Kinnear are doomed from the beginning.<br /><br />The film doesn't seem like the give and take of marriage but a good example of two people, especially MacDowell, who are judgemental.<br /><br />I hoped the plot would pick up and lead somewhere as suggested, but it failed. MacDowell has always been "cold" in her films. The other three would have a chance to give better performances with a better screenplay. Having Jewison attached made me want to see it more. I was disappointed.
