The relationship between Lillian (Jane Fonda) and Julia (Vanessa Redgrave) is that of dog and master; Lillian being the faithful puppy dog and Julia the condescending master. This may have reflected their real life relationship, as both are America-hating leftists. Hanoi Jane probably does dote on the pro terrorist Vanessa Redgrave. The story had its flaws. Lillian seemed to be sweet, naive, and down to earth until her overnight success as a playwright. Then, she instantly seemed to be a stuck up snob for the remainder of the film.Closeup after closeup of her pouty red lips as she boarded one train after another or sat in swanky European restaurants got a little old after awhile. Her cold demeanor severely detracted from the story. Even at their last meeting, Julia seemed as superficial and abrupt with Lillian as ever, while Lillian once again morphed from ice princess to puppy dog. Since Jason Robards could pass for Henry Fonda, it was a little creepy seeing Jane Fonda bedding him. Yuck!! One blooper in the film is Jane Fonda's typing ability. For someone who makes their living as a writer, you'd think they could type with more than their index fingers!
