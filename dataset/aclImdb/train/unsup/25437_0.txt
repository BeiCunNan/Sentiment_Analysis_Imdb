This could actually have been a good movie. Instead it was a bizarre movie.<br /><br />Whiteboys actually had a point; but it waited until the last 10 minutes to make it. In fact, the last 10 minutes would make a good music video.<br /><br />But by the time you get there, you don't much care any more. Because you're so tired of Flip being such a one-dimensional human being.<br /><br />It's probably funnier if you've already drunk a couple of 40s ... but then, who does?<br /><br />The rest of this comment has been added. Because IMDB insists on a minumum of 10 lines. But sometimes. A half dozen is more than enough. Like Whiteboyz.
