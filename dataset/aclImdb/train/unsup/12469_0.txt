Anyone interested in drag racing must see this. it is a true gem and a true American road movie. It is timeless in a human sense and I love it. The first time I did see it was back in the 80s and it still holds that special ingredient to make me come back for more. As far as I know it was supposed to be a car version competitor of the bike film of that time! I believe it did not need to prove itself to anyone! A true cult film. The main actors who we all know are perfect for the parts they play. I lost my video copy of this film so I am looking to replace it with a DVD soon. Anyone who dislikes this film cannot really like road movies and my only criticism of the directors of such films is that they do not make more of these 'old style' drag racing come road movies. I am sure any new films made like 'Two lane black top' will sell as true drag fans young and old are hungry for them. Ask anyone that likes drag racing and i am sure they will agree. No fancy stunts etc just good clean road racing with handfuls of drag racing will do thank you.
