This was the worst movie I've ever seen! I mean, I'm a giant fan of horror movies, I've seen so many and there definitely are MANY bad horror movies, but this movie was not only bad, it was completely senseless! The dialogs of the terrible clique of weed-headed young people were just killing me, they weren't even funny. Could anyone please tell me, why the hell the people selling chicken wings happen to be that crazy? are they some kind of relatives to the crank slaughter with the ax? Or are people living in this area just perverts? I didn't get the sense of these characters. Then, what about the cops? How stupid can one be and why are they so stupid? Was the intention of the movie to show that you can never trust in police cause they won't believe a guy who runs across the street completely out of breath and out of his mind, telling that his friends are just about to get killed near by? is it possible the movie-makers really think a cop wouldn't even stop for a second to think about it and make himself an own impression? Wouldn't he at least have a look if the story is true or not? Then the ending of this senseless minutes of horror : No ending! Crazy guy will continue to kill people who come to his house. Hm...u So let me sum it up: Bad characters, bad story because old old story with no fresh material in it, bad actors, movie FULL OF stereotypes (people who smoke weed are like this, cops are like that, people living far from the cities are so AND SO ON!) This equals a bad bad movie which wasn't worth one cent of the 5 Euros I paid for it!
