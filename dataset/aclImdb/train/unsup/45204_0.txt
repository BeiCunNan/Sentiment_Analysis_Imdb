I have visited IMDB many times for the past few years, actually almost daily. However, I never bothered signing up to give reviews until I saw The Big Hit come on TV a couple of days ago. It reminded of that dreadful day four years ago when I walked into Hollywood Theater hoping to see an entertaining movie. Without high expectations, I could have never guessed what I was in for. I still have nightmares from having to sit through that horrible movie. I cringe when I see those actors in their most recent disastrous. Do not rent this movie, if it comes on TV, change the channel. Protect yourself and loved ones from sitting through it. It is by far the number one worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some horrible ones. I feel better for writing this review, that ghost of watching The Big Hit may finally leave me alone after four grueling years. Ok, I may exaggerate a little, but it is a very very very bad movie either way. Don't watch it.
