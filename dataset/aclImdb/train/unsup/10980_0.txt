I really missed Daniel Day. Even if Daniel Day couldn't make it, I think I would have rather spent more time with the original cast than wasting time with Danny Bonaducci (which is not to say he's not a good guy, he just doesn't belong in a Nanny reunion...in fact they could have brought on some of the repeating characters from the show, like Roger Clinton or Fran's psychiatrist). I would have liked the show to concentrate more on the reminiscences of the cast than all the eating and looking at the view. In addition, I would have liked for the cast members to talk a little about what they are doing now. In comparison, I found the "Golden Girls Reunion" to be more informative and more fun for the viewer.
