I Like To Play Games Too is another offering from the Eros label, part of the Playboy empire. Although this film has pretensions to being a sequel to the original ILTPG, the film is set in an advertising agency and the leading character is called Suzanne, this film is an entirely different animal.<br /><br />Suzanne (Maria Ford) with her assistant Tracy (Stephanee LaFleur) runs her own successful ad agency. As part of her business dealings, she also likes to play sex games with her male clients, always beating them at their own game and dumping them when she wants. However, her latest client Dominick (Bobby Johnston) is a whole different kettle of fish, always managing to stay one jump ahead. Suzanne is having none of it and the stakes are raised. As in films of this type, there is a twist in the tale and we find out how Dominick plays the game.<br /><br />This should have been my type of film. There is a plot, nudity and varying sex action but I could work up little enthusiasm for this film. The problem was the laboured dialogue delivery and the general impression that the actors were acting for the camera rather than being real characters with the camera as the invisible voyeur. The only saving grace was Stephanee LaFleur who made a decent try at being the concerned assistant. There was nudity aplenty but this did not, in my opinion compensate for the shortcomings. 2 stars.
