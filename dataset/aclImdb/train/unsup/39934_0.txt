Sometimes numbingly mediocre movie about a bunch of guys and a gal in the jungle, punctuated by giant wasps who attack the actors. It looks like the only reason they dressed the hero in that ridiculous white dandy suit was so he would match the guy in the stock footage, which looks like it was lifted from some silent jungle adventure movie. Really a lot of laughs with a crowd. But, also a really bad movie.
