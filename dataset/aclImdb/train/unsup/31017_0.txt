Anyone who likes this are solely responsible for the recent years decline of movies in general. It's not a personal attack in anyway, but the sad truth is, this sort of crap sells.<br /><br />I prefer darker humour myself, but if your sense of humour is that of a pubescent teenager, then sure, I can see how you'd like this.<br /><br />The Ice Harvest was funnier than this.<br /><br />Comedies aren't "funny" anymore, you want a good laugh your better off looking towards something darker, but then again, that's hit and miss.<br /><br />It's so overly trying to be "funny" that at times it's that bad you feel like slapping yourself with embarrassment as to why you even bothered to watch it.<br /><br />The parody/spoof genre is running overly thin, and this doesn't even pull that off. The most unimaginative way to make a movie.<br /><br />If your a gang of 12-14 year olds, you possibly might like this movie, or if you wait for the DVD and have a family sit around and need something to watch, it also might appeal.
