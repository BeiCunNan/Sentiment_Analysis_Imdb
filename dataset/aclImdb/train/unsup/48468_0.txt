A Night To Dismember is probably one of the worst slasher flicks in existence. I've seen loads, but this one really takes the crown. Perhaps it was the editing problems that made it so unwatchable, but as far as I'm concerned it would have been awful even without these. There is no passion whatsoever, from the director or the actors, which ultimately leads to a dull film. Most low-budget slasher flicks are entertaining in some way or another because the director was a fan of horror films. Not so in this case. The only remotely "decent" scene is when the girl gets stabbed to death in her dreams, and she moans erotically as if she's enjoying it. I didn't keep watching for much longer than this because the film was frying my brain. <br /><br />All self-respecting horror fans should avoid this as it's not good on any level. This and another awful film called Blood Shack are at the top of my list of worst horror films.
