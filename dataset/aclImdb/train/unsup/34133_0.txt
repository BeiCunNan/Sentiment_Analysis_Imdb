This is the kind of movie that sucks the fun out of going to the cinema. Why sit through this kind of drivel when you can watch the original "All That Heaven Allows". This movie hasn't an original idea in it except to put everyone's guard up for the Politically Correct times we live in. Complete garbage, the cast is wasted. It's very depressing when you come out of the theater more subdued than when you went in, and this movie will do that to you. Hopefully, the director will not get another chance to "remake" any other director's original visions.
