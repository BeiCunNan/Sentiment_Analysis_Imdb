Here, all I saw was a morphed array of self-indulgent derivation from past movies involving kids and telekinetic subject matter. This is basically "Scanners", "Firestarter", and "Poltergeist" all ripped off for one overly long "Tales From the Darkside" episode... A kid with psychic powers is hording some kind of demonic beast in his closet which ends up killing people. The plot is confusing and poorly constructed in it's detail of exactly HOW this creature was conjured and why it's living in a ten year-old's closet. It's really just another snore-fest about kids with mind-control abilities that tried to build an "edge" by adding a monster... The effects are terrible, the acting is worse, and the story is so terribly written that I was almost compelled to turn it off during several occasions... "Cameron's Closet" is a very weak and boringly familiar thriller.
