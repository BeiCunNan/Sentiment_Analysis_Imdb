Its not the worst movie i've ever seen, but it comes real close to it...the stunts are OK, but you just keep wondering why the hell is nobody shooting their gun at the freakin'"class 4" when he's right in front of them, being surrounded by 5 people!! Second of all, the acting, it's just plain afwul. No emotions, and when there are, they are misplaced.<br /><br />I guess if you like English movies with no depth, bad effects, bad acting but a lot of fighting and shooting then you could watch this, otherwise just leave it...<br /><br />p.s. i guess the ones voting this movie 10 have probably been used as props!
