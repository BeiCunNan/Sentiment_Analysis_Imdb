I am old enough to have seen this movie first run. At the time I was blown away by this film because it had every thing in it any city kid would want to be able to do, which mostly was race horses and have a pretty girl interested in the same thing as a friend. Since this film was so important to me I feel compelled to correct an error in the cast listing by IMDb. Currently Jeanne Crain's character is listed as Char Bruce which is correct, but June Haver's character is listed as Cri-Cri Bruce which would make them sisters which they are not! Cri-Cri is the daughter of Godaw Boole, the owner of the horse farm where Char's father is the head trainer, soooooo Cri-Cri's last name should be Boole, not Bruce! I have no idea how this casting error crept into IMDb's data base, but as a movie fan interested in accuracy I'm requesting that IMDb correct this mistake. I know I am right in this because I've seen this film at least 20 times over the years and have read the book that the film is based on (The Phantom Filly).
