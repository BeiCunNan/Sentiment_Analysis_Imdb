In order to fully explain the disappointment in movie, I must state that I have just about, read every book written by and about Zora Neale Hurston and it was because of the movie. I believe it lack the realness to it. It didn't represent what Zora wanted the world to get from her book. in reading her works , any fan of her's would know that It's the opposite of, what she was trying to represent. And as much as I love Halle Berry, she wasn't the right representation for Janie Crawford. Neither was Michael Ealy, they could have found better actors. However, I respect Oprah's attempt at resurrecting a new interest in many people for one of the world's most extraordinary and misunderstood writers of our time. I think she did a better job with THE COLOR PURPLE!!!!
