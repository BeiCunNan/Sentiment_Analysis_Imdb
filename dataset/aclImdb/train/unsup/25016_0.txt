Apart from being one of the goriest films ever to garner an R rating, REAZIONE A CATENA is also something of a record holder when it comes to alternate titles. At least one of these alternate titles is insulting in its implications. In the mid 1970s, Bava's film was re-titled LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT PART 2 for certain US drive in markets. Not only was the Bava film made before Wes Craven's 1972 shocker LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, but such retitlings imply that this film is yet another Italian rip-off of an American hit. Such is not the case. In fact, REAZIONE A CATENA is one of Bava's most groundbreaking films, and one that has been copied endlessly by filmmakers of lesser talent. A firm believer in minimalist plotting, Bava here pits thirteen amoral characters against one another, as they grasp for a piece of desirable property. Rather than ask the viewer to sympathize with their plight, Bava derives great pleasure from encouraging us to sit back and rock with macabre laughter as they all meet well-deserved demises. Made in response to the trend towards graphic gore in thrillers -- a trend exemplified by Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci -- the film's tongue-in-cheek excesses leave one in little doubt about Bava's feelings on graphic violence in the cinema. Bava once again makes expert use of fluid camera movements, the cast is superb (Leopoldo Trieste is a delight as an unbalanced entomologist), and Stelvio Cipriani contributes a great score. One of Bava's best. . . and watch out for that ending! ***1/2 out of ****
