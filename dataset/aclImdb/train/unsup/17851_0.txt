This was one of the first anime movies I had ever seen. It is still also one of the best. There are aspects of other anime movies that bug me, but Golgo 13: The Professional doesn't have any of those problems. This movie is non stop action. The characters are very real and very complex. The plot is very well written and the ending will completely surprise you. This movie makes you completely forget you're watching a cartoon. One complaint: The music sounded like something out of Scooby Doo.
