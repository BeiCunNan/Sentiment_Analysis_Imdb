This episode is very interesting and it is start of a new era. This is the beginning of the Scully abduction story line, which increased and became a great success. Without the abduction, half the story line wouldn't have happened, all thanks to Duane Barry. Duane Barry is a very interesting character. Anyway, now I will say Good and Bad things about this episode,<br /><br />The Good: Wow, that was very brave of Mulder to go in there. =O<br /><br />Duane Barry talking in 3rd person. xD<br /><br />Finding out her might me lieing in the end. Wow.<br /><br />The Bad: The torture scenes. =[[<br /><br />Conclusion: A good episode all over. 8/10
