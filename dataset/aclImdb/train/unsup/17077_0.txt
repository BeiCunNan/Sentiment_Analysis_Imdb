This movie is my personal most favorite movie starring Rosalind Russell. Many may choose her "Mame" or "Gypsy" as her very best, but I think for her comedic talent "His Gal Friday" is her very best. Whenever she shared the screen with Cary Grant there was a fast-paced banter that magically makes me cackle. Grant is suave as always and just look at the sharp 40's style suits that Russell is dressed in. Love the hats. Have you ever heard anyone put so many words into a sentence without drawing a breath as when she finally for the umpteenth time tells Walter Burns (Grant) that she's out of the news business while tearing up her last interview? And then, maybe predictably, as the latest news breaks right in front of her, she automatically turns into a relentless news hound! This is a smart movie, it has plenty of plot and character development, it has great strong characters, it makes commentary on the newsbusiness then that is relevant to the newsbusiness today and sarcastically shares the modern view of government I think, as well. This is a classic movie that is perhaps timeless. See it!
