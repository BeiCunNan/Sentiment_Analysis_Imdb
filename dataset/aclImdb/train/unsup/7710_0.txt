What happened to the sweet, precocious little girl we all grew up with? When the series was canceled, I felt there was something amiss and I wanted the network to bring Punky Brewster back... they never did. Now I cannot find reruns anywhere, did everyone forget how special and beautiful this little show was? It was one of those hidden gems, a show that brought the whole family together.<br /><br />When I came home from school in the afternoon, there were two shows: Small Wonder and Punky Brewster. When they came on, I would stop whatever I was doing, glue myself to the television, slip on my different-colored sneakers and instantly I'd have Punky Power! I remember how Soliel Moon Frye lit up the room every time she smiled, it was like you knew everything was going to be alright. I loved how the show was always fresh and innocent, much better than the violence-induced cop shows and legal dramas of today's audience.
