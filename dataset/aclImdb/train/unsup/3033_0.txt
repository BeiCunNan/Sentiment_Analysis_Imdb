When Tyrone Power gambles, he really gambles. He loses big and has to pay up to Adolphe Menjou, the owner of the casino. But instead Adolphe gives him an assignment in wooing Loretta Young and posing as an Russian count at the same time.<br /><br />That's basically the idea behind this charming film. In fact, the whole film really does rely on its stars' charm and Ms. Young's loveliness. They're not given much to do and for that matter this isn't what I'd call a funny movie. Based on an idea by actor/director Gregory Ratoff, who has a supporting role, the movie drags in the second half. Looking back on it, I feel now like I am giving it a hard time, but there wasn't much to it, really.<br /><br />Watch "Day-Time Wife" first (both can be found on DVD together on a 10-movie set of Ty's.) For its production values, I give "Cafe" a '4,' but don't expect to be falling out of your seats.
