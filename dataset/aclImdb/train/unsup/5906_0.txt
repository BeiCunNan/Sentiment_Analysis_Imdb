"The Time Traveler's Wife" is a heart-warming love story, and will keep you entertained until the final credits appear. The performances are superb, the pacing is fantastic, and the emotional sensation you experience is easily worth the price of admission.<br /><br />I recommend anyone looking for a unique love story to see this film. Paying homage to memorable classic such as; "Somewhere in Time" and "It's a Wonderful Life,"it will easily be something that should find a home in your living room shelves.<br /><br />It emits a cinematic glow that hasn't been seen in years while cleverly conveying an educational message; <br /><br />"Never let go of the one you love, and cherish him/her always."<br /><br />Don't let this sparkling gem pass you by...
