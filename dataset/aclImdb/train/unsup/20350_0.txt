I cannot began to discribe my feelings towards "Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz" simply because, It is in this reviewers option. The film is a most excellent ending to the greatest animated series of our time! Why? It took all the elements of the series, and all of the questions that the fans have had. (Such as "What was Operation M?") and it not only answers them in full detail, but it also gave us a more clear view of our favorite Piolts past(s). <br /><br />Yet while this is an animated film, it is not ment for small childern however. I would recomend this to any anime fan, or for anyone who simply enjoys brilliant stories and movie making!
