This was much better than what I expected it to be. Thankfully it did not have too much to do with the whole freedom fighters stories, which we have had way too many already. The direction was very good. The acting was okay. I felt the lead role was miscasted; Hritik would have been perfect as Kisna; he does the soft (poet) and hard (warrior) sides better than anyone in the industry right now. The lead actress Antonia is extremely beautiful (She looks a bit like Nicole Kidman and a bit like Naiomi Watts) and does very well as Catherine, her emotions come out pretty well considering she is not a native Indian and not that familiar with the Indian sensibilities. Good effort and some good direction. It was 30-40 minutes too long. The whole Raghuraj sequence was over-done and did not add any value at all. I also think the whole Indian culture is superior bit is over done. If the director wanted to go there the best thing would have been to let the viewers make their own conclusion rather than spelling everything out.
