Many people might be under the concept that to make a good horror film there has to be lots of killing, lots of gore and torture. This is not true and a perfect example is Dark Ride.<br /><br />Dark Ride has the gore, the violence and killings, but this does not make it a good horror film. It seems that they tried to give it a campy look "a la Texas Chainsaw" putting a group of young kids driving in an old Van, then picking up a hitchhiker... only to be slaughtered as the movie goes into its "dark ride".<br /><br />The plot lacks originality, the acting is the worst I have seen, the characters have no personality or screen presence whatsoever. There is no connection between the characters and the audience. The dialogue is pathetic and in occasions falls in the ridicule.<br /><br />I was truly disappointed about this movie as it only tries to copy other horror gems and lacks all the elements to make it a worthy or viewable film. <br /><br />-Macabro
