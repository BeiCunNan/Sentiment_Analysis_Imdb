The movie started off really good with the diamond robbery then the film takes you to a lot of different places like flipping through a comic book which was quite irritating. Paresh Rawal & Johnny Lever were not really that funny as they usually are but Chunkey Pandey was the way he speaks was so funny that I was killing myself with laughter every time he spoke. Arbaaz Khan was the best in the whole film especially in the scene where he was threaten everyone to get the diamond with a crossbow and was wearing sunglasses. Ayesha Takia was looking beautiful & her acting was cute but the rest of the cast were not impressive and Viveik Oberoi is better off in negative roles because his acting in Shootout in Lokhandwala was terrific. The story is similar to Awara Paagal Deewana e.g. comic thriller about everyone after diamond/s. Overall it's OK to be watched once by rent or if it's on TV or something but not the kind of film to be bought on DVD. The only two good songs are Tere Layee & Yeh Dooriyaan.
