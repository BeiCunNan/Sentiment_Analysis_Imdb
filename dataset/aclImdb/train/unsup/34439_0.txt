first of all this show has loads of humans in it who don't need to be there and one in particular completely ruins this show. and if like me you favourite is tails you will be unhappy to know he gets sidelined and all the other characters except sonic and the humans which ruin it and are pointless and it completely ruins tails friendship with sonic whos a complete jerk in this show. and sega puts tails together with a female plant called cosmo who adds nothing to the series when he should be with cream. so if like me you grew up with tom and jerry or looney tunes and any other classic cartoon i urge you to stay away from this pile of garbage and the voices are awful so unless you want an ear ache...and this comes from a big sonic fan.
