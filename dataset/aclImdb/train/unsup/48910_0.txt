this is just plain bad!!!!!!!!!!not funny at all!!!are they going to take this off the air i hope! good god!!!!!i notice it has the talentless limited no range guy or girl (because hes kinda like pat from Saturday nite live) that made that stupid you tube video shoes!!this guy needs to just come out of the closet!!! he is suppose to be straight in this show god he couldn't be more of a fem!!!!and the rest of them are just not funny!!!!really bad concept as well, caught this once and that was enough for me!!im guessing that some of these comments are from the people associated with the show itself ,cause i watched it with a few people and we felt embarrassed for those involved in this. sorry to be so harsh here,but VH1 has gone down the tubes,pick better shows guys!!
