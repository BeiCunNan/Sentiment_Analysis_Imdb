i really enjoyed the movie and i cant see why so many people didn't.<br /><br />i found the direction amazing,and that combined with a great photography gave people really creepy scenes.(i went to see it expecting to be scared,and i left with the amount of fear needed in these films).<br /><br />Though i must admit there were some scenes i could do without <br /><br />i didn't enjoy reno as much as i expected,but i do believe he made a good performance.<br /><br />the girl (anne) and the young cop really caught my attention,i was thrilled to see them perform,especially the girl was perfect for the part.<br /><br />i do believe they made a very hasty end though,i wanted a bigger part of the movie to happen in Instanbul.<br /><br />apart from that i believe its a very good movie the best part of it,has to be the atmosphere created,especially in the beginning <br /><br />when the movie ended i had the same feeling i had with "bone collector" and "takin lives" (i adored both of them) i really think "the empire of the wolves" has the standards to compete with these two great movies<br /><br />the political edge though makes the latter stand out in my opinion.<br /><br />i also think that whoever enjoyed this one will love "Vidocq" and vice versa<br /><br />summary-good points<br /><br />great movie,nice performances-very good casting,excellent photography,AMAZING soundtrack,good thriller,beautiful locations<br /><br />European cinema rocks once again
