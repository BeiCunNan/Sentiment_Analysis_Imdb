I was really excited to see this. I have never heard of McG and I have never seen any of his work until now. They said he was a bad director and they weren't kidding.<br /><br />Here are a few things I have a problem with: <br /><br />1. Where was the war that we get clips of from the first three Terminator films? The wars looked awesome. There was a HUGE battle going on. People dying, terminators everywhere, etc. It was intense! Here? Nothing! We only have around maybe 5 or 10 different terminators.<br /><br />2. Why was there a 9 foot tall terminator? Why couldn't the John Conner and the others hear it coming? Something that huge would probably make the ground shake signifying that something is wrong.<br /><br />3. Why didn't Skynet terminate Kyle Reese once they got their hands on him? I remember in the first Terminator, the terminator was merciless. He ripped that one gangster's heart clean out of his chest. Why didn't he do that to Kyle? <br /><br />4. Why does Skynet have prison cells that hold humans? Why are they capturing them? Why not kill them? Isn't that the whole point of their decision that they decided in a microsecond as stated by Kyle Reese in The Terminator? <br /><br />5. Why are there keypads on the cell doors? Skynet is one giant computer right? Why not have Skynet be in control of the doors? They don't need keypads! <br /><br />6. What was the whole point of Marcus? He was useless throughout the entire film! I didn't give a damn about his character in the slightest! He only becomes useful in the end when he gives John his heart. That was the ONLY reason he was there? You have got to be kidding me! <br /><br />7. Why did McG direct this? This guy is a moron and has NO talent! The movie has nothing to do with the others except for having the machines from the other films. The HK's, T-800s, etc. That was it. McG obviously didn't see ANY of the Terminator films.<br /><br />8. Why was this given a PG-13 rating? I think the movie would have been so much better if it was given a different director and a different rating. They thought they would make more money if they gave it a PG-13 rating? They were dead wrong! <br /><br />9. In the factory toward the end, you see Terminators being built! Why aren't these Terminators being deployed to kill John and the Resistance? It looks like they're being built in the factory but Skynet is not activating them! Isn't Skynet's primary objective to wipe out the Resistance and their leader John Conner? Why aren't they accomplishing this? <br /><br />10. Why was Arnold only added at the end? I guess since Arnold ran for Governor he couldn't do movies. Obviously he can't but they did a CGI version of him fighting John. I guess if Arnold wasn't Governor, they wouldn't need Marcus. They could have Arnold instead. Also, when Arnold fights John, why doesn't he just pull his heart out? Instead, he just tosses him around for about five or ten minutes. It's stupid.<br /><br />Those are the 10 reasons why I think this movie is garbage.<br /><br />I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Please don't make Terminator 5 unless you intend to make it good.
