I thought that it was a really good film, and had strange creatures, but what did any normal monster movie person think when they first saw the title...? Actually, this is more of a G version of what the Troma studio usually produces, so people have to know Troma before the judge harshly the Troma film Nymphoid Barbarian. I thought that it kept my attention since it did have many strange creatures. This is not a Blockbuster movie, but I thought it was a good movie. It was not Heavy on Plot but it had some plot to deal with. I recommend this Troma film to the more less Gore oriented monster lovers. it is not your gross Dead-Alive type movie. More Greek Mythological type movie in more of a B range....
