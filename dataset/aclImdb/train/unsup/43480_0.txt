Scared to Death is the story of a woman's murder told by the victim as her body lies on a slab in the morgue. Not surprisingly, she tells the story of how she was "scared to death" by a variety of strange events that occurred to her, shown in flashbacks.<br /><br />Frankly, this movie doesn't have a lot going for it. I rated it a 4/10, which is probably higher than it deserves, simply for Bela Lugosi's presence and reasonable (though not stellar) performance. The rest of the acting was okay.<br /><br />It starts off with a quite interesting premise-the narration by the spirit of the corpse on the slab. I had thought that it might lead to something interesting, but sadly the script and storyline seemed just thrown together and incoherent. Strange things occur that were presumably frightening enough to cause the narrator's death, but that just bore the audience.<br /><br />Hardly worth seeing unless you are a Bela Lugosi completist, in my view.
