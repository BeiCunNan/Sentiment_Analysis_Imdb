If you're going to make a "spoof" movie at least try to come up with a decent plot, one that does not completely insult the audience's intelligence! There are so many times in watching this that you are expected to suspend your disbelief that it is ridiculous. I didn't find one line in this movie funny or even "cute." With the exception of the Lucy and Amy characters, I have seen better acting on Gilligan's Island. I think people who say they like this movie probably think it is great only because it throws in a lesbian relationship as the core of its theme. That's not enough to save this stinker! This is close to the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is beaten out by Protocol and The Man who Fell to Earth, so it gets a 2 from me instead of a 1.
