Yikes. <br /><br />I can't believe I'm saying this about a film with Jennifer Connelly in it. I mean, issues of People magazine with her in it have more purpose.<br /><br />But not Career Opportunities. These actors have done amazing work like Requiem for a Dream, Once upon a Time in America, A midnight Clear and Pulp Fiction, but skip this one. It is not in the same league. I'm fine with top actors doing a 'fun film' (Joe Pesci in Home alone e.g.) but fun doesn't need to = poorly directed.<br /><br />It's jaw droppingly pointless, not funny and a waste of even a Netflix evening.
