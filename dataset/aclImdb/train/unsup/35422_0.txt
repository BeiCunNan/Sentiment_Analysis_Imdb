This movie was stupid. The plot was nonexistent and the script was primitive and moronic. There is something seriously wrong with Samuel Jackson these days (Snakes on a Plane?). Why he agreed to do another "xXx", I wouldn't know. Vin Diesel must be thanking god that he got out of this. I hope he realizes how lucky he is.<br /><br />Ice Cube should never be able to be within 100 feet of a camera. He is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. He is a boorish oaf. We get that he likes the girls. No need to cram in unnecessary, crude innuendo. A 4-year old could have played his part better.<br /><br />The key to watching this movie without getting angry is to not question the plot and only pay attention to the heavy explosions. So, if you decide to watch this movie, turn off your brain.
