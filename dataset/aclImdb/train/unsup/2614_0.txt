This movie was full of flat jokes and bad gags. Chris Farley tries but does not deliver very many laughs. Matthew Perry bringing his Chandler Bing character from Friends to the wilderness does not work. Even a few stabs at off the wall humor hardly produce a snicker. I kept waiting for this movie to get going but it just kept coming across like an over long comedy skit. Eugene Levy and Kevin Dunn were the only two characters that were funny. It was a shame there was not more for them to do. Making a comedy from a history lesson has it's possibilities but they blew any chance with this boring attempt. It was nothing more than SNL AND SCTV go to the woods.
