This is the kind of crap that appeals to the Oprah crowd. It's this kind of nonsense that makes men out to be "predators" and women "victims". It's incredibly dumb, offensive, and appeals to the lowest common denominator. Not worth seeking out, even for the curious. And if there is ever any justice in the world, this movie will never show up on DVD. The budget is low-rent, the direction is incompetent, the premise is pathetic, the acting is non-exsistant, and the screenplay is for the birds. It's a good thing this feminist propaganda film is out of print. The plot is about "violated" women out to seek vengeance against evil men. Yawn. Probably right now it is showing on the Lifetime channel.
