Well, this one is a true diamond! Ever since I watched it the first time as a 7 year old, I have loved this movie. I am now 29 and still do. I don't know how many times I have seen this movie, but it manages to catch me every time. <br /><br />This simply has to be the best animation movie ever made! Yeah, i am aware that recent animation movies are a lot more technically advanced. but the fact that it took more than 20 years, and a heck of a lot more technology, for the rest of the world to duplicate what Ivo Caprino did with his dolls, stands as a bullet proof testimony that the guy was an incredible genius. Ad to that the marvelous script written by Kjell Aukrust, an equally genius man, and you have a movie that will continue to amuse people young and old, for decades to come. <br /><br />Yes, I have been impressed by the good animation on recent animation movies, and some of them even have a darned good plot, but they don't even come close when it comes to sheer entertainment value. And even when it comes to animation, this movie,despite it's age, are better than some of the new ones! It should not be possible, but it is!!! <br /><br />There is something about that low key humour and warmth of heart, that lack in recent kind movies. Nowadays it is just full throttle action from start to end. The plot often seems to come second or third. Flåklypa Grandprix makes you fell strongly for or against the characters, whom are so wonderfully described, that you feel you know them personally.<br /><br />Now, there certainly are plenty of action in this movie, but even the Action sequences is made with a twinkle in the eye.<br /><br />I realize that much of the humour of the movie is very "Norwegian", and as such may be difficult to translate. And sadly I have been told that Norwegian is one of the hardest languages to learn in the world. This is probably the reason that it is relatively unknown outside Scandinavia.(shakes my head sadly) but I know there is both an American and German version. I have not seen any of those, but still I urge you all out there, if you ever get the chance to see this wonderful movie, then DO IT!!! I am fully convinced that you will have a fond memory for the rest of your life. <br /><br />I apologize to all Americans that read this, but Disney Company could never make an animation movie half as good as Flåklypa Grand Prix. Not now anyway. Disney's latest productions looks like they don't even care making an effort, and keep resting and snoring on Walt's laurels. That was a man, which genius even Ivo Caprino had to look up to. <br /><br />Well, thats it for now. <br /><br />PS! The Car Race at the end of the movie, are so good that you actually find yourself forced to the sides of your chair by the G force.
