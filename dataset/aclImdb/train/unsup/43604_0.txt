Strange gas erupts from the earth and mysterious red lights appear out of nowhere, causing the world's population to slowly die off as this unknown menace moves from the North & South Poles toward the equator. The main part of the story focuses on 5 folks in the woods and how they deal with the situation. How? By talking...and talking...and talllllllking. Somehow one guy into UFOs lets everyone else know it is UFOs because, well, he is into UFOs and knows aliens from Mars moved into Earth's core 8,000 years ago. Good lord Rebane, what are you thinking? Even if this has a germ of a good idea, the execution is so terrible that nothing can be forgiven. Not even the cool, snowbound setting. I can take cheap any ol' day, but not cheap and boring. The only thing that kept me amused was that this uses the same theme from James Bryan's LADY STREET FIGHTER. Well, I was amused until I remembered that theme was stuck in my head for weeks after LSF and now it will be stuck again.
