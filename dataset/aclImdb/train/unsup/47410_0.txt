Stunningly beautiful nature film about elephants trying to rescue their kidnapped family.<br /><br />Cute to a point but the film's ability to entertain you will depend on whether or not you can stomach the voice over voices given to all of the animals. The voices have been laid over the animals natural sounds so we can hear the voices and their real sounds, its not well done. It might have worked had the script been a little more intelligent and not aimed at the lowest possible age group. Its the sort of thing that is gang busters if you're four or five, but any if you're older its an endurance test.<br /><br />Thank god I wasn't watching this with a rug rat cause I could turn it off, which I did after about 45 minutes.<br /><br />3 out of 10 for the great pictures.
