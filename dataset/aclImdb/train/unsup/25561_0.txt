Daffy Duck is elected into congress. Seem the perfect opportunity for hilarious madcap hijiks to ensue, but alas they don't. Nope, this is an educational short to tell the young ones about the three branches of government. It pretty much fails at saying anything more then what those three branches are and leaves it at that. Not really that educational at all when you think about it. And as such it doesn't warrant multiple viewing, heck I'd be hard pressed to say that it even warrants one viewing. This recent animated short can be seen as an extra on Disc 3 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2.<br /><br />My Grade: D
