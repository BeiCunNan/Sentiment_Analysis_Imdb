It seems that the intent of this movie was to make you feel bad for these "poor" rich kids. All it made me do was think how ridiculous they are. If they want a normal life or whatever they can have one. They can go to school meet a woman get married and have kids and not take any of their families money. They are capable of doing whatever they want but all they can do is feel sorry for themselves. I also didnt like how the Director didn't remind us who the people are. There were so many rich kids I couldn't keep track.
