Like a dog chasing it's tail this movie goes nowhere. Too many characters it becomes confusing, and eventually crashes into total silliness. This is NOT black comedy, it is idiotic try and be as strange as possible boredom. Constantly starting new angles and then somehow trying to tie a story together out of these disjointed fragments does not make for entertainment. Some of the characters were so uninteresting and boorish that they could have been written out entirely and actually improve the film by shortening it. Avoid at all costs even if it is in the cheap bin. It is a waste of time, talent, and celluloid. - MERK
