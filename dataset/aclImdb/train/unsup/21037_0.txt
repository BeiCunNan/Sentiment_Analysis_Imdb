This is a piece of crap. The only people that would like it are children with no film knowledge. The acting is so bad it's laughable... I mean, Ron Jeremy is in it... enough said.<br /><br />Don't waste your time... if you want to save yourself time just smear poop on your TV screen... it's much quicker.<br /><br />The directing isn't that terrible, but the writing and acting are like a student film. actually they are worse than a student film... when i was in film school people actually knew what they were doing. what the hell was Willem Defoe thinking? well... at least he was smart enough not to appear in the sequel.<br /><br />This movie sucks.
