The way that this movie involves you is completely unbelievable.<br /><br />What impressed me the most was the way that the movie started. Not at first. As i saw the beginning i was really absent of any emotion, just another bum. I guess i'm a product of society and really don't see the story behind that person. As i saw the movie it moved me, i loved the characters and the way the story was told. A sad story, but told in a positive way.<br /><br />I didn't cried during the movie, i loved how the author didn't exaggerated on the little girl's death.<br /><br />The problem was when after finishing seeing the movie i went back and saw the first minutes, and then... oh boy did i cried. Not just another bum now..<br /><br />I guess the humanity that the movie transmits and the way that it does so, is incredible.
