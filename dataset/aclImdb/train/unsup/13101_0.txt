It must be more than ten years ago that I saw this mini-series. Probably a period that I loved very dramatic films and books. But I can never forget this series. It was film so 'smooth' and 'rich' and especially the music was dramatic. I'm really curious what I would experience if I would see it these days. It's funny that the bible-borrowed title of the series announces that the clash between Kane and Abel will be very dramatic. That's very smart of the creators, I think.
