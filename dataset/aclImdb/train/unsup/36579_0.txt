<br /><br />FOR HOPE is a TV movie recounting the slow, slow death of a 40 year old woman. The film offers little other than sharing the experience of an utterly hopeless, and very long, deathwatch. The result is pretty ugly and depressing. The production is well meaning, but as a whole is lacking any entertainment value. The bottom line recommendation is don't waste your time.<br /><br />
