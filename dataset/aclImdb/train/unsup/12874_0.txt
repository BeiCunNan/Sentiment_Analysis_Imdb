This is by far, one of the best Canadian animations ever. This guy is an absolute genius. I just hope one day he makes this into a TV show. The best part (in my opinion) was Hoverboy battling the Robot. Super funny.<br /><br />A must watch!<br /><br />Words really can't describe this obscure film's brilliance. The animation is brisk and flawed only when it should be for hilarity's sake, the actors are all obviously in love with their characters (that's what I get from their vocal performances) and it is even funnier for me, having been someone brought up on Spider-man and Rocket Robin Hood.
