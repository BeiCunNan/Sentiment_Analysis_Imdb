I'll have to say "Cowboy Bebop" is the anime with the greatest soundtrack ever(from what i've seen so far anyway)...it's all in the music...i just loved it. most anime shows have crappy music,it's not the case here :D. oh yeah, the storyline and characters are awesome as well. You'll fall in love with it from the first episode. Definitely worth watching, especially for the people who like jazz and rock (and not only). <br /><br />Two thumbs up from me!<br /><br />See you later space cowboy!<br /><br />Well, if i think about it Gungrave has a cool soundtrack too...my bad.
