My gods, that was terribly boring. You could literally put someone to sleep with it. It almost put me to sleep. and the dialog made me cringe more than just once. <br /><br />The whole 'body switching' crap is so terribly uninteresting for me. The episode is also completely forgettable, I keep forgetting about it unlike other bad episodes like 'Space' where you immediately know what it was about. Honestly, only good thing about this episode was Gillian Anderson's acting. She's entirely believable. <br /><br />This episode is my third ONE star. I think I might even like Ghost in the Machine better. This is boredom to the max.
