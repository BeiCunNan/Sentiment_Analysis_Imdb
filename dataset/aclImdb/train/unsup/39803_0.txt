After watching the Police academy movies over the years (those were not masterpieces, either, on the contrary), I was rather curious if this series was worth watching and if the jokes were good or at least somewhat better then those on the big screen. Boy, was I disappointed! I've seen parts of two or three episodes of this series and all I can say is: painful, gruesome, as bad as it can be! If you don't expect a comedy, the script is actually acceptable. If you see the title and look forward to relaxing and laughing, AVOID WATCHING IT! The "jokes" and "funny scenes" are so bad, they make you cry! I think even a kindergarten kid would have to give his best effort to smile once. Even Police Academy: Mission to Moskow was, as hard as it is to believe, BETTER than this.<br /><br />5/10 as a series, 0/10 as a comedy series
