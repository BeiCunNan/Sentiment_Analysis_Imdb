Terrible movie, absolutely awful! With a script that's just plain stupid and a clueless directing, the whole point of the film is silly. The characters are flaw, stereotyped and predictable; they act and evolve for no justified reason. Under these circumstances, even the good work put up by Paz Vega -great as usual in a character not so far from her usual roles- can't avoid the sinking of the ship. On the contrary, her partner Santi Mill√°n becomes as clueless as the director; and it's even painful to watch a good slapstick comedian as Pepe Viyuela in such a stupid character. Mix all that in a story filled in with product placement and obnoxious commercials, and what do you get? 2/10, being generous. A comedy without even a good joke during all the movie? Definitely one NOT worth watching.
