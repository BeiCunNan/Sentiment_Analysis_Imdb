I agree with the previous comment. Plus, believe it or not, some of the jokes were rather subtle. For example, it was shown at a time in which "Real men don't eat quiche" was a cultural saying. In the show, the muscular good-guy hero and Princess Ariel were sitting on a blanket preparing to eat a picnic lunch that Ariel had prepared. She pulled out many items and offered each one to the hunk. When she off-handedly offered him quiche, he merely replied in a normal tone of voice, "No thanks." And that was it. No laugh tracks. You had to actually watch the show to understand and appreciate the comedy (I tend to do additional activities during TV shows).<br /><br />Julie Duffy was outstanding as the spoiled, self-centered princess. This role was reprised during "Newhart" in which she played a spoiled housekeeper in Bob Newhart's series at an inn in the Pacific Northwest.<br /><br />Anyway, good show. It is still missed.
