How could a man survive after being crushed by a trash compactor? <br /><br />The hospital doctors, the police, and Columbo himself apparently didn't notice that, and didn't try to explain the reason why. Is that because the trash compactor stops automatically for security reasons? Yeah, got it! But... <br /><br />Evidence comes too late, this time, for such an intelligent mind like yours, dear Columbo...<br /><br />The hand-written Dudek's lines in Russian (and Clayton had luck Dudek didn't add something like "my darling" or "honey" eh eh): OK, Columbo can demonstrate where that ink comes from, but can't explain the content of such lines ... Was Dudek forced to write, or blackmailed? Did Clayton employ some trickery to convince his enemy to write those lines? Perhaps what lacks here, dear Lt. Columbo, is a little deeper insight into the romantic affair between Clayton and the Russian girl.<br /><br />Apart from that, some very enjoyable scenes (Columbo's dog and the chess match in the restaurant above all): 7/10.
