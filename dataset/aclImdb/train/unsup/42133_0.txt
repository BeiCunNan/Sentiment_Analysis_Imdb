I saw this movie on 14 May in France. I was really excited before the movie. I was just waiting for a fantastic Kustrica Movie! Unfortunantly, it was not a good movie. And also, I hate the movie!!! Why? Because, it wasn't a fantastic movie trial and also a political propaganda! I watched this movie with my French friends. When we left the cinema, they started to talk about Serbian Public. They thought that the Bosnian people made lots of bad thing to Serbians. Because, in the movie, it is clearly shown that the war between Serbian and Bosnians was started by the Bosnian Public!!! This is not true! Actually, Kustrica couldn't mention the war... or if he really wants to mention, so he could be realistic! He must think that why the Serbian President is in the court now??? Why there are no Bosnian people in the court?? The answer is so easy, but anyway with the movie, he wanted to change the idea in the people's mind. So, by the way people who have no idea about that war could think that Bosnian people are the ones who started, and behaved in a bad way. Or he showed the Muslim public (Bosnian) different than the real! <br /><br />As a conclusion, this movie is not about Love, not about people have fantastic life, it is just about the Propaganda of the Serbian Public..So, poor Kustrica.. I think you just approached your end in your career.
