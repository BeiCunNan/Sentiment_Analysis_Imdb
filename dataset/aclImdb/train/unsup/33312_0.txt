This movie was one of the most surprisingly entertaining movies I have ever seen. The dialogue was just not grossly disengaging, but the gawdy dance choreography couldn't help but make me laugh. This movie reminded me of West Side Story, except as if directed and choreographed by a blind, mentally challenged individual.<br /><br />The storyline, if you can call it that was so terrible. While watching the movie you know it is so mentally abusing to do so, but like a train wreck, can't help but keep your eyes fixated on its amazement.<br /><br />Definite must see, if you and your friends want to have a great laugh, or if you are just feeling self-destructive.
