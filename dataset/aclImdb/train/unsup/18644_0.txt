This superb and movie will be doomed for failure in the USA, no it does not have a superhero that will stop WWIII, it does not have a deluge of special effect. It is just the story of a very brave man who listen to his hearth and tried to save as many lives as he could and refused to listen to orders, politicians and false promises made by the United Nations.<br /><br />Graphic it is, humane it is too. Americans will hate it as it is very Canadian in its approach.<br /><br />On TV former President Bill Clinton said the Rwanda tragedy was the worst failure of his career. It was that of the Canadian Government too as well as that of the United Nation. Amidst all that horror a man refuse to give up. A must see movie that Canadians will love and Americans will hate for the hero is not an American this time.
