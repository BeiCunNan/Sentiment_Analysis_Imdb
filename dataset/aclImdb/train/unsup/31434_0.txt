When the first EVIL DEAD came out in 1982 or whatever 80 something it was gore after gore after gore in such a small budget and it became known as one of the most shocking films. Then when EVIL DEAD 2 came out director Sam Rami give it a new turn on the first one. And also adding a very good blend of slapstick humor into it.<br /><br />Ash (Our well known hero) is back on the road to the cabin in the woods with his girlfriend Linda (The one with the missing head) this time and all too soon they came upon the book of the dead and release the demons upon the woods and same as the first one Linda gets killed in the same style and new characters and scenes came along, Annie along side with her boyfriend Ed (Soon to be Evil Ed) comes to the cabin to put the missing pages together and the redneck Jake and his girlfriend comes for the ride. The new moments added Ash's hand coming to life running around a dead old women coming out of the basement and a new spin on the attack of the forest (they do much more than raping)and added crazy comical moments into it which works very well.<br /><br />EVIL DEAD 2 is one of those well creative turns in low budget film-making, sequel to EVIL DEAD and prequel to ARMY OF DARKNESS.
