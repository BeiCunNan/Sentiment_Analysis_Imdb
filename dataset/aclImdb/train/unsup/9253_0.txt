I have to admit it, I didn't really mind Keith Olbermann when he was on ESPN. Unfortunately for Keith, he peaked with "Sportscenter" some years ago, and the ratings for both his show and his network prove this. I do watch this show from time to time, and its more like something reminiscent of propaganda programming from the 1930's than either a news or current events program. If you are looking for real news, legitimate discussion of politics or current events, don't look here. This show is even more biased to the far left than Fox News is toward the right. Its ironic that he constantly rips on right wing talk show hosts for being so hateful, but in my opinion he is just as hateful (if not more), just from the left rather than the right. Judging by his ratings, it seems as though even the left is bored with this nonsense. I am a bit surprised that this show hasn't gone off the air, but I would imagine it will go the way of "Air America" before too long......
