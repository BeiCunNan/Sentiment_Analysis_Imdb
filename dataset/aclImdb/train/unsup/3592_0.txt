A mysterious killer, dressed in black leather and a motorcycle helmet, is offing the staff and models at an agency/studio; risking their lives, Magda and Carlo (Edwige Fenech and Nino Castelnuovo), a couple of photographers, attempt to discover the murderer's identity before they too become victims.<br /><br />Andrea Bianchi, director of cheesy fun 80s zombie movie Burial Ground, makes sure that this enjoyable giallo lives up to its wonderfully lurid moniker by packing it with tons of nudity, sleazy action, and violent deaths. From start to finish, hardly a minute goes by without either a bloody stabbing or some gratuitous T&A from one of its delectable female stars, which is great news for fans of the genre, particularly if they enjoy their movies on the 'trashier' side.<br /><br />Sexy lead lady Fenech obligingly strips nude for the audience on several occasions, but it is Femi Benussi, as aspiring model Lucia, who really steals the show: with her stunning looks and a winning set of curves, it is a real shame that she falls prey to the leather-clad psycho so early.<br /><br />The story may not be anything particularly special, but the marvellously un-PC content (slutty women are treated like dirt by chauvinist men), endless hot Euro-chicks, and a magnificent funky soundtrack make this one a guilty pleasure.
