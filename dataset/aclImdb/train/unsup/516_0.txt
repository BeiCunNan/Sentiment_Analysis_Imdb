I almost went to the pictures to watch this one but due to some reason I could not and just caught up with the video release. I expected `the hole' to be another basic slasher teen movie. I was wrong. It actually deserves much more attention than those. The acting was quite good unlike most teen flicks and Thora Birch (the little girl from `Patriot Games') was excellent, she succeeds in carrying the movie alone. The plot is quite complex and gruesome and the director managed to shoot some scenes with a lot of cleverness which brings about nerve racking situations and very tense moments. The film starts a bit slow with some pointless scenes but it got better and better as it went along. The last scene is extremely well shot and acted, there's no dialogue actually just gazes and stares but it's so well acted and done that we are able to guess exactly what's going on in the characters' minds. In addition to this, the score suits perfectly to what's happening on the screen. I give it an 8 but it could well deserve a 9 in comparison to other teen horror flicks. It looks like a nasty version of Big Brother (there is even a shrink !) but unlike Big Brother the film is entertaining, very impressive and worth watching although the twist is plainfully obvious. However, I would not recommend this one to any person who suffers from claustrophobia !
