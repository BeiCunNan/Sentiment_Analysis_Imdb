This series is the ultimate blend of British comedy and low-budget sci-fi. Dave Lister, a working-class, curry-loving, lager-swilling, chicken soup machine repairman aboard the asteroid mining ship, Red Dwarf, is placed in stasis as punishment for smuggling an unregistered cat on board. While in stasis, a radiation leak kills the rest of the crew and the ship's Artificial Intelligence, Holly, takes the ship on a course to deep space until the radiation levels drop enough to be safe for humans. Unfortunately, this takes 3 Million years. When Holly brings Lister out of stasis, he finds that he's the last remaining human in the Universe..his only companions being a hologrammatic version of his anal-retentive bunk mate, a neurotic android butler, a humanoid who is the evolved descendant of his cat, and the now-senile Holly. Nothing is safe from the writers of this show...from Jane Austin to the JFK Assassination. If you want to enjoy a ROTFLMAO bit of mind candy, check out "Red Dwarf"!
