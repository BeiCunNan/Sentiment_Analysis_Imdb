This is a wonderful film and amazing to look at even today for its technical prowess. Unfortunately for this film, though, the remake starring Sabu was an even better film and was overshadowed a bit because of this.<br /><br />Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. plays the thief. He is a real scoundrel and not particularly likable,...that is, until he meets the woman of his dreams, the princess. He vows to straighten up his life after he introduces himself to her--beginning by telling her the awful truth about his life. Despite this, the princess is head-over-heels in love with him--thanks to his fulfilling a prophecy made earlier in the film about the identity of her beloved. However, daddy isn't pleased with the thief and has him beaten and thrown from the castle. Other, less wonderful REAL princes are left to vie for hand. However, she wants Douglas and comes up with a plan to send all of them on a chase to bring back the greatest treasure. Douglas decides to enter this contest as well--and due to his new-found goodness is able to make himself a prince and win her lovely hand. The film fades out as they take a very spectacular magic carpet ride away from the city of Baghdad.<br /><br />The film strongly excels artistically. The city appears huge and grand and generally very real. The special effects are also top notch. Fairbanks is also incredible with his athletic prowess as he effortlessly climbs ropes, battles silly looking monsters (the only minor drawback among the many special effects) and leaps about the scenery. About the only other minor negative is that occasionally, Fairbanks' performance is perhaps TOO Athletic--as he didn't do quite a convincing job with the love scenes and quieter moments in the film. Still, it's a silent masterpiece.
