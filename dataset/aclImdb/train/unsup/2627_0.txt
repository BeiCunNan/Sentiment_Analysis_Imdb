Whomever filmed this to leave a meerkat dead when they obviously were there filming it and could have saved it is not an animal lover in my opinion. This disturbed me and I think you should rethink your filming process! Obviously you were there you filmed it. I thought this was in bad taste and then you want people to sponsor all of this. Why so you can film another helpless animal dying in the sun. They may have a tough time of it but obviously greedy filmmakers are no help. Why don't you make slasher movies it suits your personality better. I can't even believe animal planet would be "down with this" and show it. Poor Poor Taste!
