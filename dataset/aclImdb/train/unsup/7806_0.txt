The scene in which our heroine is forced to choose the most beloved toy in a room absolutely crammed with goodies, surely rates as one of the greatest moments in the cinema. As you know, I'm not a keen fan of Lana Turner, but here is a vehicle in which the blonde siren excels. Not only does she enjoy a highly sympathetic character to work on the audience with, but in Wesley Ruggles she has obviously found a sensitive director with the ability to help her exploit every dramatic and comedic opportunity the clever screenplay provides. True, poor old Robert Young does get jostled out of the picture for a while, but he does return with a couple of hilarious solo routines, including his famous toppling-over-the-balcony bit at the opera.<br /><br />"Slightly Dangerous" not only revels in first-rate entertainment, but it's produced with Leo's customary flair and impeccable polishÂ—including a wonderful roster of Hollywood bit players and cameo artists. Just look at that cast! In fact Wesley Ruggles was a director who paid particular attention to the minor character players and was always concerned that a scene be milked for its maximum effect. He'd quickly replace an actor who could not give him precisely the impact he wanted. For instance, Mickey Rooney's dad, Joe Yule, was originally cast as the painter, but the director thought he was too old and lacked the flair that this little bit needed. Yule was replaced by Joe Devlin.
