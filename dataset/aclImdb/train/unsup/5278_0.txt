Sharply satirical, hilariously funny, intelligent, but also in terms terribly dated comedy about the stupidity, lack of heroism and relentless worship of the German emperor united in the title character, a lazy student. Superb cast delivers right-on-target-performances and the direction is to a point flawless. One of the most influential all-time-classics of German cinema.
