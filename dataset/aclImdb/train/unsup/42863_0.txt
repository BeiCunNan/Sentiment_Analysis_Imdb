God i wish there was a 0 option in the Vote box. I can't believe that this was a sanctioned movie. People thought that Jar-Jar was heresy. This was 47 min of pure drivel and the makers should be burned at the stake. No matter what the budget, no one should make a Star Wars movie that is this bad. The only difference between this and the bigger budget movies is the writing. The effects are fine but what makes this suck is the writing and bad acting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I just can't believe that any self respecting Star Wars fan would ever make this film. It is god awful and should be buried with anything Carrot Top. Do not see this movie you will fall asleep as i almost did.
