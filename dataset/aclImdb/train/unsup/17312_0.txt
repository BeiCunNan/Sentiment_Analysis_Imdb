As with 98% of horror movies from the 90s to present this film is missing that "raw" video, which made horror movies in the 70s and 80s so scary, they felt real, it was the basic nature of them, the true to life scenarios and the film quality itself that gave it that gritty realism. This movie, while entertaining, is your typical cinematic horror movie just like the previous Texas Chainsaw. In my opinion it is hard to capture that raw, uncut feel that makes a horror movie scare me, Besides the amazing work done in House of a 1000 corpses no movie prior to that from the 90s to present scared me, simply entertainment. And while House of a 1000 corpses didn't make me scared for my life it definitely captured that 70s vibe and quality that is missed by so many of these films.
