Varalaaru aka Godfather is an awful movie, with a thin story. The only reason for casting Asin in the movie is the songs. Kanika's role is even worse and she hardly has anything to do. (It's intriguing to see why a young girl would agree to act as the mother of a 35 year old actor!!!) Lousy story.. frivolous characters.. sudden duets.. all of these leave the viewer wondering when the movie is going to end, and not how. Considering that even A.R.Rehman's songs are bad, there really is nothing that could keep you in your seat till the end.<br /><br />The only thing tolerable in the movie is Ajit's performance - he has put in effort to portray different characters, and he has done it quite reasonably well.<br /><br />If you have the patience to sit through this movie, do listen carefully to the last dialogue in the movie. It is the only indicator to why the movie was named 'Godfather' in the first place.<br /><br />Verdict - it really is awful. Please don't try to watch it except if you are an Ajit fan.
