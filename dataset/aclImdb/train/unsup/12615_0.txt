I'm not familiar with the other movies in the Matt Helm series but this is all I need to watch.<br /><br />Sharon Tate plays an MI5 agent posing as a clumsy Danish tour guide, Freya Carlson, who is to work with Helm. Tate stated at the beginning of her career that she wanted to do light comedy and "The Wrecking Crew" proved that that genre was indeed a perfect fit for her. This movie is the highlight of her all too brief acting career and my heart aches to think of what could have been.<br /><br />Dean Martin's acting skills left a lot to be desired but he and Tate had great on screen chemistry. The rest of the cast reads like a Who's Who of Hollywood during its second (and last) Golden Age: Nancy Kwan, Elke Sommer, Nigel Green, Tina Louise (of "Gilligan's Island" in her small role of Lola Medina), among others. You have to remind yourself to close your mouth during the opening credits.<br /><br />I'm in love with the 60's fashion and music and the fact that we get to see more of Sharon Tate (whereas the rest of her movies, with the exception of "The 13 Chairs" a/k/a "12+1," are primarily small roles where you don't get to see or hear her much).<br /><br />Good stuff.
