When writing or directing a children's film, far too often<br /><br />people find it necessary to dumb down work in order to cater to<br /><br />a young audience. Fortunately this is not the case with The<br /><br />Secret Garden, a film in which the story it presents is well<br /><br />crafted and intelligent, and appealing to both young and old<br /><br />audiences. In many ways the production could have gone<br /><br />dreadfully wrong. One can see where in the hands of a less<br /><br />talented writer or director the story could have become<br /><br />melodramatic, overly sentimental, or comical, yet The Secret<br /><br />Garden is a beautifully executed picture that rings true as a<br /><br />result of its naturalistic storytelling. Much of this is due to<br /><br />the credit of its fine cast. Frequently, child actors are<br /><br />employed to act "cute" onscreen, but there is not a young actor<br /><br />in this movie who does not give a performance of great depth. In<br /><br />fact, it can easily be argued that each one of these children<br /><br />exhibit greater skill than many adults currently working in the<br /><br />realm of cinema. But what is at the heart of The Secret Garden<br /><br />is a beautiful lyrical story about love, childhood, growth, and<br /><br />healing. There are moments in the film that are so genuinely<br /><br />touching the viewer's heart almost stops. Such is the case of<br /><br />the scene in which the bedridden Collin is escorted outside of<br /><br />his house and his eyes open to see spread before him his<br /><br />mother's beautiful garden. No line of dialogue is necessary, for<br /><br />the happiness and peace that appears on Collin's face speak<br /><br />volumes in regard to his character. The film's ending emotion is so rich and moving that it is<br /><br />impossible for the filmgoer to sit untouched. This story is an<br /><br />absolute delight, and should be a must for
