I actually live about an hour outside where this film was shot, and have been there many times (wow, privileged eh?). The film is set in Natal, but filmed in Port Alfred. If you live in South Africa, you would appreciate the fact that Port Alfred is easily recognizable and it seems a joke to try and make it out to be Natal.<br /><br />Aside, I can't believe how bad this is for a 1999 film, even if it is a TV film. Why would van Dien act in this crud. The story is lame, lame, lame. Let's face it, Jaws was the original. Deep Blue Sea is great though, but this and Cruel Jaws are vile.<br /><br />Also, being South African, I laughed at the accents in the film. It seems that no film yet portraying the South African accent has got it right. This film's attempt was even worse than Val Kilmer's attempt in The Saint. I suppose that it is a little known accent and it only annoys South African's though.<br /><br />Whether you live in SA or USA, watch this film and despair.
