This is such a beautiful movie. I could go on and on about how good it is but I don;t want to bore anyone. <br /><br />"Splash" is the story of a love between a new york Bachelor and a mermaid he meets in Cape Cod. She saves him from drowning and eventually meets up with him in the big apple. He doesn't know she is a mermaid so basically the rest of the movie is about her trying to conceal the fact that she is not human,while they are in the meantime falling in love. Tom Hanks, Daryl Hannah, Eugene Levy and John Candy give fantastic performances and the New York images are just breathtaking:)<br /><br />Katrina
