A lot people will disagree that this is no where near as good as Universal/ Tales from the Crypt first movie 'Demon Knight' - I personally think its just as good. OK so its not the best vampire flick ever made ( the lost boys, was better) but its pure fun - Did you honestly think any of the actors would take there roles that seriously in a tales from the crypt movie?? Angie Everhart is great as the wise cracking vamp and Erika Eleniak is not much different from her bay-watch character, so you can kind of get the idea what its going to be like - go in open minded and just go with the flow. These are the sort of films Corey Feldman ought to be in!!
