since I am a hugh fan of that 70's show, i had the feeling that this show was gonna be a step down. but it wasn't. I love it.<br /><br />the chemistry between the characters just made it impossible not to like even thou I already had made up my mind before even watching it.<br /><br />the relationship between corey and tuesday(so hot in this show, not as hot in movies like "not another teen movie") is presented in a manner that brings hope to us with a ... diffrent lifestyle, that the gap between normal and e.g a punker is not that significant.<br /><br />acceptance is important to me, that is one of the reasons I love this show, maybe more then that 70's show + that tuesday is like the finest thing i have ever seen :)
