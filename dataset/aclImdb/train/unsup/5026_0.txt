Chamber of Horrors is an entertaining British horror/mystery from 1940. I have the VCI edition of this on video which I had ordered from the US.<br /><br />A series of murders at a creepy mansion are connected to the secret of a door which has seven keys to it and nobody has opened for a while. A young woman tries to solve this mystery and all is revealed towards the end when the door is opened... Includes a mute butler and a mad doctor who collects items used for torture. Also a thunderstorm.<br /><br />Though not a lot of action in this movie, it is quite creepy and atmospheric at times.<br /><br />The cast includes Leslie Banks (The Most Dangerous Game, The Tunnel) and Lilli Palmer.<br /><br />Chamber of Horrors is worth a look if you get the chance. A good old mystery.<br /><br />Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
