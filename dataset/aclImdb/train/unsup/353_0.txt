After executing his last legally ordained job as a Montana marshal, Seth Bullock moves to a gold-mining camp known as Deadwood, where he and his partner Sol Star strike a deal with Al Swearengen, on a lot for their hardware store <br /><br />While suspicions arise that 'road agents' may have been the true perpetrators of the killing of an entire family on the Spearfish road, competition arrives for Swearengen in the form of the Bella Union, a new joint from Chicago operated by Cy Tolliver<br /><br />Deadwooda town without any laws or courtsis the center of a gold rush and is presided over by Al Swearengen, a saloon owner, and a brothel operator His showing makes two different things between the coward and the lapse of momentary fear Let him doubt those he's trusted, this camp will run red with blood<br /><br />The show centers on Seth Bullock, a young man with a powerful temper who got a lot of Hickok's qualities But being a man with an active conscience Bullock declines to accept the horrors around him<br /><br />We are rapidly introduced to most of the other important characters:<br /><br />Wild Bill Hickokan asset to any saloon, and any joint he frequentscomes to look for business opportunity and sits there, losing at poker He is the fastest gun around While his respect for Bullock grows, he commissions 'Montana' to do a review of the Garret claim...<br /><br />Cochranthe town doctor who takes heat from Al Swearengen every time one of the whores is poorly sickwas full of opinion and took the most comprehensive view when he treated the bright widow Now he doesn't feel at such perfect liberty to opine on her husband's case as he did on hers<br /><br />E.B. FarnumJudas Goat looking fellow, coyote-moving typeis Swearengen's water boy, the innkeeper of a thousand faces staring straight at extinction<br /><br />Brom Garretthe naïve city investor who had to go all his $20,000 to turn Farnum away and purchase a gold claimpursues his remedies in some other fashion <br /><br />Sophiathe little survivorcould settle who killed her people, road agents or Sioux<br /><br />Jewelborn with difficulties and hardships that got no curewants the doctor to brace her leg so her dragging it doesn't drive Swearengen crazy<br /><br />Charlie Utterwho considers himself an important hand at the freight business plays a man too loyal and honest for his own good<br /><br />Whitney Ellsworthwho saw something he shouldn't have, a man pushed off from a ridgeseemed very competent and trustworthy<br /><br />Mr. Wuthe only source of opium in the campfinds a common language with Searengen when an opium theft occurs <br /><br />Smiththe Reverend who has a distinct, clear set of moralsknows from past experience that it's a solace having friends <br /><br />Ian McShane is a joy to watch He gives a first-class performance as Al Swearengen, the oppressive boss who can order the execution of any man in the settlement with just a word McShane who runs his Gem with the help of his cronies, emits power in every order he gives<br /><br />While McShane is a marvelous villain who generates a palpable menace, Boothe is maniacally evil as Cy exuding despicable charm  Well dressed Cy is the gentleman on the outside while more cruel as Swearengen in beating, kicking, and killing<br /><br />Such a performer was found with Timothy Olyphant, very effective as a formal marshal who understands the danger of his own temperament Seth Bullock stood before Alma Garret as a married man to his brother's widow after he was killed He took their five-year-old boy as his own son<br /><br />The 4 show women that are trapped in a man's world are: Molly Parker as Mrs. Garret, the beautiful addict wife who suspects foul play She inevitably feels she's had some part in what befalls her husband; Kim Dickens as Joanie Stubbs, the very attractive solitary woman who uses to make Cy warm; Paula Malcomson as Trixie, the prostitute who must've done some fancy to keep Al from Killing her She tries to help Alma with the orphaned child while keeping her master in the dark; Robin Weigert as Calamity Jane, the sewer mouth that follows Hickok around When she confronts the greasy-haired dangerous man who pulls all the strings, she fell apart, broken and weak<br /><br />There's something powerful and moving about 'Deadwood' It's truly a drama of memorable characters, dark and ultra-violent If you love Westerns, don't miss it!
