Far more cynical and sophisticated then its predecessor, "Patriot Games", Clear and Present danger dares to suggest that the world isn't made up of good guys and bad guys, but just a whole lot of people out for their own conflicting and selfish interests.<br /><br />Jack Ryan is also more interesting in this movie. Although he does do a bit of action-hero stuff, most of the time he is shown using his head not his muscles.<br /><br />In this regard, it is both deeper and realer then the movie it sequels. Its a toss up which is the smarter: this or Red October, but for its convoluted political and moral landscape, I give this one my vote as best of the original trilogy.
