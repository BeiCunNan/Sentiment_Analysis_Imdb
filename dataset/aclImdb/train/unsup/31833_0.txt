On a scale of 1 to 10, Andrea McArdle has to be rated a ten if only for the strength, clarity and beauty of her singing abilities. Add to that the fact that the girl can actually act. To see her in any movie would be a treat. To see her in a movie depicting Judy Garland, another showbiz "10" with a voice that overwhelms, is an unbelievable delight. "Rainbow" tells the story of the emotional triangle that proved to be a trap for Judy Garland. Wanting to please her parents, wanting to "make it big" in show business, and always longing to be a normal girl proved to be a conflict too large to overcome. The movie is bittersweet in that it shows the drive the mother infuses into young Judy Garland, the special relationship between Judy and her father, and the unbelievable talent inside this child, all the while reminding us that each of these facets took a toll on Judy Garland and eventually shaped her life both in positive ways and in ways that were painful.<br /><br />A good movie. I really wish it would be released on DVD. It definitely would be a worthwhile addition to any collection.
