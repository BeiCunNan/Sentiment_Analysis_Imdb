But you may easily be disappointed, if you see Jessica Lange's performance here, whom I had so much respect for (well, there are few moments when she actually is believable, but most of the time she's just too fake, would-be cool and high above), and even worse, Diane Keaton's pathetic and unbelievable acting. And she was so good in so many other movies, what a shame...<br /><br />What does make the movie worthwhile are the performances of a nasty Tess Harper and, before all, a wonderful Sissy Spacek. All in all, Lange, Keaton and Spacek don't deserve this film and it doesn't deserve them, nor can they save it. Oh yea, and the characters have rather stupid names and act in a too hysterical way. Though hardly enjoyable, Spacek and the better part of the story raise my personal rating to 4 out of 10.
