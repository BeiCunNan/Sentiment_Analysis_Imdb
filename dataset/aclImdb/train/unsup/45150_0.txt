This is a lavish production, flawed in two ways; 1. Gratuitous and irritating framing of far too many shots, through doorways, curtains, pillars, horse's tethers, etc. I could go on, but you get the idea, and 2. inadequate performances in some of the leading roles. Natalie Portman as Anne is great, as is David Morrisey as her uncle, and Kristin Scott-Thomas as her mother. However, Scarlett Johansen is far too weak, as is Eric Bana as Henry; I kept thinking of Robert Shaw in "A Man for All Seasons". Winona Ryder probably would have made a better Mary. George Boleyn ended up too much like Del-boy's brother Rodney. However, I did enjoy it, although the TV version was as good. In addition, it paled in comparison with Elizabeth, Elizabeth: The GoldenAge, and Elizabeth I. One other thing; Scarlett's performance does not bode well for Mary, Queen of Scots. She's pretty enough, but does not have the stature that both this Mary and MQoS requires.
