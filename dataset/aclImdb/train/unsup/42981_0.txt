I went to the video store expecting great things from what I've heard. I don't have to have a totally action packed movie in order to enjoy it, but wow... this movie is a pretty honest account of something like what many people go through, but still... geez. I get enough of the same old stuff in real life. I gave Dancer Texas a 4 out of 10.
