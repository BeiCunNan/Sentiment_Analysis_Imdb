A rich, posh young woman moves from a quaint part of London to a run-down area, where she dreams of living a social class existence and escaping the corrupt influence of money. That's it. That's the whole film. We watch a lady who had it easy giving it all up so that she can live in poverty, because allegedly poverty is better than being unhappily rich.<br /><br />I find this film woefully unconvincing, and it's theory that there are lots of good points about being poor is hard to swallow. Most people I know aspire to get out of the gutter and to climb to a respectable status, but here that notion is reversed. The main character played by Suzy Kendall is downright annoying anyway, so it's awfully hard to care much about what happens to her during the course of the film.<br /><br />After spending two hours of my life watching this film, I have no insights into its characters or its social and moral standpoint. The film was a waste of time. It is probably the worst film that director Peter Collinson has ever made, other than the horrid Open Season (1974).
