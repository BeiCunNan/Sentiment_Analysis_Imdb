Another tender and moving direct for t.v. movie starring John Stamos. In the likes of "A Match Made In Heaven"; this movie displays the perfect, funny, tender relationship between Walter Matthau and John Stamos. I really dug how well they got along. Their were a very charismatic on-screen duo.<br /><br />The relationship between Stamos and Polo is also very good. Polo is incredibly beautiful and has a unique charm. Also, when they have the "big" difficulty you can't help but feel touched.<br /><br />Matthau steals the show once again with a moving performance. The man can say a lot of things with his eyes... In memoriam. A truly great, great actor.
