I thought this film would be good but after seeing it i was disappointed. I don't think it was educational in any way (people know about aids) and was full full of the usual superior western comments (teaching the rest of the world a lesson kind of stuff) and there really didn't seem to be any point to the film!, if it had just been a good story with the nice scenery and cinematography it would have been much better!.<br /><br />The acting was pretty good but i'm basing my rating on the film as whole and not on the individual elements.<br /><br />But don't take my word for it, watch it and judge for yourself.
