I thought this movie was pretty good for the budget they had to work with. I live near where some of the movie was filmed. You know that scene in the beginning with the guy jumping over the fence? That was on my Uncle's property in Robertsdale. Some of the Cafe scenes were also filmed in Robertsdale at Mac and Jerry's. The filming people even left some of the props they brought in back of Mac and Jerry's. It's kind of weird living right down the road from where some of this movie was filmed. Hometown Legend is a decent, family friendly movie that deserves to be seen. All in all, I really enjoyed it, and am glad that I bought it.
