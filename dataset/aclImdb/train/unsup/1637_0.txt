What can one say, a MasterPiece down to the details. 6 ppl is acting out a story that is just mindblowing. You have this set of totally different persons trying to live and co-exist, and trying not to conflict. I don't want to spoil the movie for you by telling you something from it, so I'm just gonna give you this advice. See it, and act it out with the movie, and you will have a movie experience to remember!
