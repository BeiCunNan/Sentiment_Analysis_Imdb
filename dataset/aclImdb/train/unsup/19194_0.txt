I rented this film way back in 1987. I had never heard of it and the PG rating had me expecting the worst. Still I love horror films so I gave this a try. I saw it on a dark, cold winter night. There was a snowstorm going on outside, I was alone in the house and I turned off all the lights. Under those conditions this film scared me silly.<br /><br />The opening is all sound effects against a black screen of something attacking a family in their house on a winters night. It gets in and kills them all. Very effective--the sound effects are realistic and NOT seeing the monsters makes it all the more scarier. That opening alone is worth seeing this for.<br /><br />It's an anthology movie--a bunch of kids telling horror stories around a campfire. The movie is tame (remember--it's PG rated) and the stories are kind of predictable but the middle one got me going. It's about a bunch of guys spending the night in a deserted, supposedly haunted house. They're on the first floor...and then they hear noises on the floor above...THAT scared me silly. The ending was REAL bad but, for a while, that had me shaking.<br /><br />So, it's not a good film, but there's something about it that really works. I (cautiously) recommend this.
