Don't expect ACROSS 110TH STREET to carry the mile-high groove factor like the A.I.P. movies. This, being a very early entry to the blaxploitation genre, may have triggered controversy over its showing of racial violence to the general public. It was no doubt that 1970 introduced the phase anyway, with COTTON COMES TO HARLEM. Aside from any historical figures, the authentic detail of dark, inner-city Harlem life was the main attraction along with the bloody, nasty violence. Anthony Quinn's appearance doesn't matter, but Yaphet Kotto's indifferences with him add more juice to the film. "Blaxplo" fans have seen stuff like this before, but there are plenty of rough guts to chew on in this action drama where the ghetto is no place to hide or escape from. Another fine classic from the gritty 70s.
