As a suspense-thriller about Islamic terrorism, "Traitor" is tautly-scripted and well acted by Don Cheadle and a cast of mostly unfamiliar names and faces. It takes place in a breath-taking array of locales, shifting countries and continents with nothing more than a skyline and a subtitle to tell the viewer where the characters are now. The beautiful Archie Panjabi shows up all too briefly as the girlfriend of Cheadle's character and is provided with little back story, as is also the case with most of the other players. It is difficult to become fully invested in characters about whom you are told so little -- but the story carries you along and certain of the mysteries are left hanging, even when the film ends. But, although it came and went without much notice, "Traitor" is well worth seeing.
