Simply put, not even Robin Williams could make this movie funny. If you do decide to go out and see this, it shouldn't be for it's alleged humor, but for the sad but true depiction of today's modern family. A good movie to compare this to would be Christmas with the Krank's, both of which deliver the same amount of stale jokes, and no character development. At no point during the movie did I even chuckle. I am not kidding when I say that I did not laugh the whole time I was there, it almost felt down right stupid. And Coming from a guy who laughs at incredibly stupid commercials this should mean something. I feel cheated out of my money and time. So don't take any chances. Sit down with your family, order a pizza, and rent a copy of National Lampoon's Vacation instead. Trust me on this one.
