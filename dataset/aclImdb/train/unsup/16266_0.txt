I thought Rupert Everett did a great thing in impersonating sherlock Holmes. I have read Conan Doyle's books, and i always thought that many of the actors, including the classic ones, came short when it comes to his arrogance and eccentricity. Everett on the other hand really plays the eccentric hand very well, and of course proves to be right always.<br /><br />Ian Hart as the ever dumb assistant Watson obviously is having a lot of fun in his role; the Watson inherent vanity contrasts superbly with Holmes superior mind. Though the story in its foggy setting is in itself a very nice thing to watch on a dark December evening, I guess the acting part of the two lead actors is more exciting than the allover predictable course of investigation.<br /><br />A very good scene indeed is the moment when Holmes throws some dice to estimate depth... look out for it.
