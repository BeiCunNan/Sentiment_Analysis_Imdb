Anybody who is sick to death of the standard glut of Summer block busters has a lucky break here. Irina Palm is a small,quiet film about a widow (Marianne Faithful,who will always be remembered as Mick Jagger's girlfriend back in the mid to late 60's,and had a brief recording career herself before Heroin & other drugs side tracked her), who has seen better days,finds out her grandson is dying from an illness that could only be cured in a hospital in Australia. Problem is, neither she,nor her son & daughter in law has the money for the trip & operation. She decides to raise the money by becoming a sex worker at a Soho sex shop,where she services men by hand. Despite the rather grim & glum nature of the film, there is an underlying current of humour that's a welcome breath of fresh air. You may have to search this one out a bit, as it was originally produced in 2006, but has been getting rather scatter shot distribution. You could do a lot worse than Irina Palm (like anything with Adam Sandler,Pauley Shore or Rob Schneider).
