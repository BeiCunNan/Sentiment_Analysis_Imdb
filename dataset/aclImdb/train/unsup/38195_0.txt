I hold the makers of this film personally responsible for the permanent psychological scars this film left on me. First off, let me just say, Lief Garret, should not act in films...EVER! Pornos, travel or cell phone commercials, voice overs on radio, nothing that requires the slightest inkling of talent. Secondly, hiring a man who defies the term "obese", and showing said man, shoving his bare fat ass out of a car window, is a crime against humanity and God. Not just a passing glance either, but a long hard studious, eye-gouging, long shot. Then seeing the sheriff, an aging hairy beast of a man, in nothing but his boxers, nailing the head cheerleader of the camp, for a "touch-down". I ask you...what have I done to these film makers. I've always tried to be good, and live my life accordingly. This movie cannot be described in words. Suffice is nothing compared to the masterpiece that is, "Sorority House Massacre II".
