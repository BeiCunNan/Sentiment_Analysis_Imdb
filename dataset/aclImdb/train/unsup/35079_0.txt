William Powell is an amnesiac who can't recall his past beyond waking up in a hospital in Marseille in 1922. He had just survived a train wreck, but has no memory of the event or any of his past. <br /><br />Now of course he's a rising young man in the French Diplomatic Corps about to get a big appointment in pre-World War II France and he's accused of being a former master criminal. The evidence against him is 50/50.<br /><br />Basil Rathbone who says he's a former partner in crime with Powell now is engaging in a bit of blackmail and he's contrived quite a scheme to convince Powell he's who Rathbone says he is. A quite unbelievable scheme at that.<br /><br />It's sad that MGM wasted the talents of some of its best players for a story that's quite unbelievable. I don't want to write any spoilers, but let me say in order for this scheme to have worked Rathbone would have had to have psychic abilities to rival Nostradamus. <br /><br />Hedy Lamarr has little to do, but be Powell's faithful missus. And Claire Trevor, Felix Bressart, Margaret Wycherly and H.B. Warner have all done much better films.<br /><br />In fact the only reason it gets as many as three stars is for all the stars in this thing, God Bless 'em.
