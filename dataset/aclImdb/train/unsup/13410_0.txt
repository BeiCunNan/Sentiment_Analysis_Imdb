This film is fantastic. What a powerful 80 minutes of film. It was so informative and emotional without shoving anything down your throat. The way the delicate and sensitive subject matters were handled was graceful and respectful. Kudos.<br /><br />It made me feel angry, sad, and compassion for the people that are struggling to voice their stories without making a fiasco out of what happened to them.<br /><br />Like so many other documentaries, this one did not try and play with my emotion with overly sappy music or editing. It was simple and precise. The music was haunting and had the perfect mood for the piece. The interviews were not overly edited for dramatic effect, but were simple and honest.<br /><br />I watched it twice. Cried both times. And I feel more educated and compassionate for renting this great film.
