This must be the worst movie I've ever seen. There is no plot, aside from the lead character trying to score the hot girl, which I can safely say has been done before. The acting is just awful, I haven't spotted one true emotion. The movie was cut together in a very unorganised way (and I'm not talking Pulp Fiction style) and seemed to just stop before the story was over (and I'm not talking Lock Stock style). <br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I liked American Pie, all three where a good way of passing time. Road trip was funny, and so was Euro trip. I'm not an enemy of the genre, just an enemy of this lousy movie. . out of *****<br /><br />Don't say i didn't warn you.
