I know this is an animated movie,where the animals talk and not a documentary.But I wonder if maybe it was made in response to it.I saw this on cable a long time ago,when I was 10.The movie is about a little fox cub,named Vuk, who decides to wander off from the safety of his den.He lives with both his mom and dad,and shares the den with many young,sleepy siblings.Before he even returns home though,he is greeted by his uncle,who has some unsettling news.While he was gone,an evil farmer and his two stupid mongrels killed his entire family.His uncle helps raise him,and they have some fun and exciting adventures.Later on when he is grown up,he and his uncle rescue a vixen named Panny from a cage.The farmer had caught her and put her in there to kill her,or trap Vuk and other male foxes. Together, he and his uncle decide to settle the score with him and his mongrels,by taking something really important to them.The two dogs are humiliated and made fun of by the other neighborhood dogs.This is a great family movie with both sad and funny moments,especially with what happens to the dogs.Watch what becomes of two geese,who are drunk on wine.They're so busy laughing up a storm,slurring their speech and being clumsy,they don't know what will hit them.They had stolen the wine from the farmer,while he wasn't looking.All around great movie,I give it 91/2 * out of 10.Was this Hungary's version of a sequel for The Glacier Fox?Just asking,so please don't flame.
