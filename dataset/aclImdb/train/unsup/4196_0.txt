Coming off of swashbuckling successes Captain Blood and Robin Hood, it was only a matter of time before Warner Bros. sent Errol Flynn, Michael Curtiz and Olivia de Havilland out west for a formulaic but basically entertaining (if you can get past its dated charm) adventure in the saddle.<br /><br />Sprawling duster packs everything into its 100 minute plus running time but an Indian raid. One wonders if they shot one but couldn't work it into the already bursting plot containing a wagon train, an epic saloon brawl, cattle stampede, gunfights and lynchings, and a perilous shootout aboard a burning train. Though the elements are glaringly contrived, the film still manages to generally pull them all together into an adequate whole, and there are some good comic moments and decent performances.<br /><br />Errol Flynn looked far more at home with a sword than a six shooter, but, while not John Wayne, he's fine here as the goodguy cowpoke pressed into service as Sheriff when things in Dodge get a little too nasty. You can see where so many latter westerns from My Darling Clementine to Tombstone gleaned their inspiration.<br /><br />Consummate 30's/40's badguy Bruce Cabot is on hand to make it a tough ride for Errol to maintain law and order and old standby Alan Hale Sr. provides some of the levity as his sidekick, Rusty. The romantic happy ending between Flynn and de Havilland too is never (of course) in doubt.<br /><br />Except for Guinn Williams getting to be the centre of attention in one of moviedom's biggest saloon bust-ups, the film boasts no real surprises and is strictly one dimensional fare. But it gets the job done and is worth a look if you've never seen it.
