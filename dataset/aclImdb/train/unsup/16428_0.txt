THE PRODIGAL is one of the dullest films I've ever seen. There's almost no need to watch this pseudo-Biblical film because there's nothing worthwhile about it. The pacing is glacially slow. The acting is wooden. The dialogue, risible. And the much vaunted sets are more on the side of tacky than spectacular. And a miscast Lana Turner has basically a secondary character. No wonder it's forgotten. But the film's biggest liability is the main character, Micah, who's a complete jerk. Micah is about to get married to a beautiful but ordinary girl but when he sees Turner, he drops the girl and tries to woo Turner. When it doesn't work, he goes back to his family and all is forgotten. How Christian of him! <br /><br />Seriously, this film sucks. It's the weakest film in the Historical Classic package, which also contains COLOSSUS OF RHODES and LAND OF THE PHARAOHS, which are much better and more entertaining than this static, tacky disaster.
