I'm not sure if the movie was initially meant to be a HORROR movie or a COMEDY.<br /><br />With that said, this movie one I would never recommend - EVER.<br /><br />I enjoy the horror genre, and even the "funny" ones but why movies like this were ever made frightens me.<br /><br />This one particularly lacks acting skills, the director needs to go back to school and the special effects artists work here is an utter joke.<br /><br />Back to the drawing boards guys.<br /><br />Hope this movie was your FIRST attempt.<br /><br />Thank you drive through.
