Four Rooms is a collection of four stories -- all of which take place within the same hotel. The first segment ("The Missing Ingredient") is, quite possibly, some of the worst drivel I have ever watched. It's downright painful to sit through. I got the strong impression that it was written very quickly, and that it was written with the intention of being humorous by a person who doesn't know the first thing about humor.<br /><br />I can't even remember the 2nd story ("The Wrong Man"), which is a testament to the poor quality of the first half of this tape.<br /><br />Thankfully, things start to pickup with the 3rd installment "The Misbehavers" (written by Robert Rodriguez). I'm glad it came along when it did, because I was painfully close to ejecting the tape. This segment is, by far, the best of the lot.<br /><br />The 4th segment, "The Man from Hollywood" is exactly what you'd expect from Quinten Tarantino. It's chock full of outrageous dialogue and Tarantino overacts like there's no tomorrow.<br /><br />All in all, this is not a "movie" worth renting.<br /><br />I give the first two segments a 3/10, I give the latter two segments a 6/10. Overall I'd rate it a 4/10.
