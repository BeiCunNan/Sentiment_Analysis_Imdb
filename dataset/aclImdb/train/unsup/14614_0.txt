One of the weaker episodes. Why? For being a great show and all the plot build up the writers of Supernatural had a hard task at hand. No one can blame the writers for the story climax of season two being such a let down. The town, the special kids duel and Sam's mother knowing the demon where all cheesy. The story would have made a great regular episode, but the writers had hard time trying too match the brilliance of the season one's final episode. I was not surprised if the writers are tring to add new ideas for the season 3 story lines. 7 out of 10. I feel like there is a need for more. Maybe I need to watch this episode a second time, or wait to see if season 3 will make sense out to the season 2's story climax.
