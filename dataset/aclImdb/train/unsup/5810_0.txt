This sequel gets off to a fairly good start as three bikers from hell meet in a deserted bar . Boy are these guys scary , they're the reason why you don't want to go to an American jail . On deeper reflection they're the reason you don't want to go to America period . Unfortunately having established these bikers are ruthless violent criminals the screenwriters inject a piece of violent action which is totally unnecessary and which draws attention to their actions iun the context of the movie<br /><br />If truth be told these bikers could have been amongst the best screen villains of the 1990s but the cast are let down by the screenplay , it's both very contrived while failing to explain some things . Bikers are right wing aren't they ? and these " Western Brotherhood " guys confirm this by stating they're like the old pioneers before America became a god forsaken melting pot , so what are they doing hanging around with a black crimelord ? That's because it sets up the sequel featuring Reggie and Jack , like I said contrived . It does explain how Reggie is involved but it's rather throwaway and unconvincing , the script would have been much better if it concentrated on niggling little things like how can characters be abducted from a supermarket and brought into a busy nightclub without anyone calling the cops <br /><br />If you loved the original then you might enjoy this sequel but it was spoiled by a very clumsy script
