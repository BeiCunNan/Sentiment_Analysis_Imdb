Anybody who hasn't guessed the surprise ending of this one by five minutes in deserves what he gets.<br /><br />Which is not much.<br /><br />Some goofy and abortive mooning over the meaning of life, a couple of boring chases on a snowmobile, some special effects that woudn't cut it on Halloween.<br /><br />And Vick's repetitive killing of Adam actually gets funny after a while. Like a Roadrunner cartoon without the Acme products.<br /><br />And can anybody explain why almost the only time Vick wears a hat is when he's indoors?
