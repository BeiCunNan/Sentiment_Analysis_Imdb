Really enjoyed this but especially because of Susie Amy who plays the lead character, she really held her own against some big names, and is beautiful.<br /><br />It's an all round entertaining film, which I believe was made for TV. I completely disagree with some of the reviews here about the acting, the reviews at Amazon.com where I bought the DVD were really good.<br /><br />I like this sort of film, it's easy viewing, not difficult to follow, the writing is very simplistic but the characters were throughly entertaining. Surprisingly I thought Gerard was one of the weaker performers compared to his usual standard.<br /><br />Well worth watching if you enjoy all round light entertainment.
