Ms. Ginger Rogers is 43 years old by now (1954) and in one of her last roles before retirement. Here, she plays somewhat against type, being a bitchy society grande dame. Despite being top-billed, it's actually a supporting role, although it's definitely the juiciest part. One of her lines is one of the best I've heard in a long time: "She was insane! To hang herself when she could abuse drugs!" I'm kinda warming to Ms. Rogers, though I'm still not finding her face memorable. She brings her brand of energy to her roles, so that she stands out even when the role or even her acting isn't all that good, she still shines. That's what makes a star.<br /><br />This is coincidentally also one of the last roles of Gene Tierney, one of the most luminous of actresses because of her classic beauty. While not big on acting talent, she was still capable enough to fit perfectly into femme fatale roles in film-noir movies (e.g. Laura and Leave Her to Heaven - her sole Oscar nomination). That she plays a put-upon wife here is a waste.<br /><br />Fellow film-noir regular Van Heflin rounds off the cast. He is good, as is the movie, but the highlights are definitely when Ms. Rogers is on screen.
