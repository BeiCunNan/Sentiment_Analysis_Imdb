Many expat Hungarians were in the audience at the viewing I attended, probably thinking that they were going to see something on the order of "the history of taxidermy," or a movie that featured rooms in a museum full of trophy fowl. By mid-way through the first vomiting scene, these lovely cultured people were excusing themselves from their seats, never to return. They seemed to feel somewhat embarrassed, sharing a common nationality with the filmmaker. I tried, yes I tried, to find merit in this concoction, but the final scenes completely lost me with the grotesque makeup of a 300+lb. man, immobile, and having to rely on his son to remove the waste products from his continual and deliberate slothfulness. Just when I thought the son would show us some humanity by leaving his gross father and gloomy taxidermy shop, perhaps becoming a Hermes model or something meaningful like that, he ends it all by taxidermying himself! I realize he was rejected by the female grocery clerk repeatedly, but the loser kept retrieving his money from that pelt of a pouch he had made, leaving the tiny paws of his victim still attached. Now, seriously, THAT is a turn-off right there! Go and see it if you want, but I did warn you. P.S. There is no one in this movie that looks even remotely like Audrey Hepburn. The overweight are celebrated.
