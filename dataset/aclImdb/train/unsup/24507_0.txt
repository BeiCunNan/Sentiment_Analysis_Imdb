This is your average "horror" teenager movie. <br /><br />The plot is basic and very predictable. A group of college students all receive a mysterioussms telling them they'll be dead in three days. At first they suspect it's a joke but when the first one disappears during a party and is found dead, things change and the students investigate / get slaughtered. <br /><br />The young actors aren't bad and the cinematography is OK. There is one noteworthy graphical horror scene (the aquarium murder) but the film isn't really too gory. This movie isn't worse than most similar stuff coming out of Hollywood nowadays, in fact i'd say it's slightly more interesting, and it has the added benefit of being the first film of its kind to be produced and directed in Austria.
