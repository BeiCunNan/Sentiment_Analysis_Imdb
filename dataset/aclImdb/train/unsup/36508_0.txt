Substandard zombie flick offers little means of distinguishing itself other than an incestuous child played by a 26 year old midget. Some nice gory special effects in places, but the storyline, acting, dubbing, and zombie makeup are all either average or below average in comparison to other European zombie films of the time. Zombie film buffs may enjoy it, but for others, there are much better ways to spend an hour and a half.
