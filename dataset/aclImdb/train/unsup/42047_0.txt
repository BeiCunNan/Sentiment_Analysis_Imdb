Welcome to Evil's City, where the population isn't in fact 4,320; it's 0! Yes, I said it. This film was horrible. It was an indecent, cheaply made satire of how a scary movie is supposed to be. I found the film quite absurd that it was made very poorly. The movie was created using Microsoft Movie Maker and Power Point. I could edit a picture better than Tom Lewis can name a movie. Before I continue to describe my fetish for "enjoying" this putrid pile of garbage, let me break it down to you in every category.<br /><br />The acting in this movie was about as stale as the bread slice lodged down my throat. I also found the actors choking on their lines more than I was choking on that slice of bread. Before I was able to die of complete and utter disappointment, I managed to realize that the actors kept a smile :) on their faces throughout the entire movie. I felt this film was more of a comedy, rather than a horror film! Oh, excuse my comedic ways. That bread must be making me grow a sense of wit and absurdity!<br /><br />*spoilers or w/e get a life. I'm not ruining anything you won't see it anyway.* <br /><br />The plot for the movie was simple: Nosey kids getting into trouble. If I were these kids, I'd have stayed living in my parents house until I reached the humble age of 30 (I'm 34 currently and unemployed, lol) and grow a beard on my own. Instead of being good mannered children, they go around accusing people of lying, starting fights with homeless people, stealing chicken from someone's house, breaking into the houses to steal the food, and causing someone to remember they died. Not to mention, they stole some Aussie's key chain. Later in the movie, they encountered a crazy man with half a head. He then explains the whole situation. I didn't follow it because I was too busy scratching the mole on the side of my neck. The only bit of excitement came when some crazy girl was going to dig into this guy's pants. Too bad my mole gave me more excitement. <br /><br />*no mo spoilin stuff.*<br /><br />The movie had special effects as good as this movie wasn't a horror film. I felt as if I was playing a Sega CD game. I suppose a poor man makes a poor movie! Oh dear, I'm killing myself. But seriously, to put it in a nutshell, the special effects were as lame as Casey Sharpe.<br /><br />The suspense in the movie was good, though. I found myself clinging to the edge of my seat when the movie was over. I was actually thinking there would be more. The movie ended abruptly and so is this review.
