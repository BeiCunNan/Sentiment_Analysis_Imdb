I was fortunate enough to catch "Just Write," on Starz last night and was greatly pleased (and surprised) with this film. I found all of the main characters to be very likable and also found the writing to be stellar, at worst. The film has inspired me to the extent that I just ordered three screenwriting books off of Amazon.com! When a movie has the power to make a person feel something strong or inspire them to the point that they will do something about their inspiration, then it must be a great film, and "Just Write," is!
