This is a horrific film, made all the worse because it's all true. Annabel Chong is an intelligent, articulate middle class student from Singapore, where her parents are so proud that she's managed to get to America.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what she does in America is make porn films - films like "What's a nice girl like you doing in an anal movie?". This film is structured around her record breaking attempt to have sex with 251 men.<br /><br />And it is exceptionally grim. En Route, we meet the characters who work in the porn industry, see Annabel's friends and realise that she is very, very screwed up.<br /><br />This is a snapshot of humanity at its lowest. After watching it, all your liberal assumptions are challenged. A grim but essential film.
