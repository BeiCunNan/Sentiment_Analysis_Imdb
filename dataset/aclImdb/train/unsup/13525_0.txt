These twins (the writers / directors / stars )want to be shocking, creative and profound, and often seem to wish they were David Lynch. But they don't have his brains or talent. So it's slow without being meaningful, and preachy with no wisdom. Even in a stylized film with bizarre elements, things have to be real on some level, and very little here rings true. As far as the style, it's juvenile and derivative. The model who plays the erstwhile girlfriend is nice to look at, but that only goes so far, especially considering the absence of any nudity to break the monotony. An empty, pretentious, stupid film.
