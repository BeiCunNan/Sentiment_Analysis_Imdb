It looked good on the trailer, I keyed in a reminder on my Digi Box, it came on, It was rubbish.<br /><br />Patrick Stewart an actor I admire- is he short of work?<br /><br />Also was this in 1863?<br /><br />Nemo said he had been on the island for 10 years, lost his family in the 'Indian Revolution' so that would have been 1853..<br /><br />Only I think he was vaguely referring to the Indian Mutiny, which happened in 1857..<br /><br />Confused, I was.<br /><br />also why were the pirates right off the set of 'Prates of the Caribbean??<br /><br />Who wrote this, a bunch of 9 year olds?
