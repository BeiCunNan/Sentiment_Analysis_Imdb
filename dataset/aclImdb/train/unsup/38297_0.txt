Ok don't get me wrong, I love vampire and horror films, but I have to say this is the only horror film that I've actually fallen asleep trying to watch, and not even the wonderful Robert Patrick can redeem it.<br /><br />The only mildly redeeming area is friends turned and still pretending to be themselves, but even that wasn't done very well<br /><br />Sorry, but I would only ever recommend this film to someone who has to treat insomnia, otherwise watch something else instead
