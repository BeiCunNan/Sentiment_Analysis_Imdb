Let me start off by saying I was forced to give this movie a positive score and my actual rating is -28. If you enjoy being bored to sleep or feeling sick to your stomach, this is your kind of movie. I don't think words have been invented in the English language yet that can fully capture the disgracefully poor quality of "Killer Ants!", but I will do my best. The acting in this movie was some of the worst I've ever seen. Listening to the one liners thrown back and forth between the main character and the women made me throw up several times in my mouth. Probably the only things more sickening were the action sequences. I think the director stole his kids piggybank and used it to fund the entire movie because thats the only explanation for the ridiculously stupid battles and explosions. In one scene, the two main characters are fighting off a horde of ants moving towards them at 3 meters per year. Instead of running away, they wait until they are surrounded so we can see the same picture of ants repeated over and over again. I don't think a retarded kid could have been fooled into thinking they were actually surrounded by ants on all sides. To sum things up, if you are feeling in any way suicidal, do not watch this movie as it can make the happiest person in the world want to jump off a building. I hope FX and any other station that airs this movie goes out of business and suffers for allowing this movie to be seen.
