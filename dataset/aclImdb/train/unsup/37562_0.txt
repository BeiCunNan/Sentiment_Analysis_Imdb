I read the comments on here and went in expecting something really good.<br /><br />I was so very disappointed by this movie. <br /><br />I really like this movie on one level but I think it could be A LOT better. <br /><br />Something was lacking. The characters don't seem to click, the ending felt incomplete and there was not enough relationship development. Why did they have a topless scene is beyond my comprehension.<br /><br />The acting was good, there was enough humour to keep me smiling and the music was heart warming.<br /><br />I totally recommend the movie to everyone but I only give it an E for Effort.<br /><br />If you are reading my comment, ignore how others are over-hyping this movie. Expect only a 6/10 from this movie.
