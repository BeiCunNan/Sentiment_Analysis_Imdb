Hey, I loved this movie. My husband and I laughed all the way through. This movie is worth seeing and buying. Don't listen to those negative people who are so critical. Rent it today! If you have children you need to know there are a few f-words in this movie. My son watched it and he laughed his head off. I wouldn't normally allowed him to watch this kind of movie, but it was not said in a derogatory manner. It was meant to be funny. If I were you, I'd give it a chance, which I did and that's what I'm writing this review to you. Hopefully you feel the same way. There are a lot of funny parts and it's way better than some of the lame movies I've seen. Check it out today!
