a woman sits at her daughters bed and the next thing we see is that she is somewhere in the woods in a coffin-like box. WTF? there is no connection to ANYTHING in the next part of the movie, except that she has a daughter. then she's bound to a tree with a razor-blade in her stomach which she can pull out and save herself. (i don't think anybody would survive that) i don't need to talk about the other girl having no problems at all after her tongue has been cut out.<br /><br />this film gets increasingly boring every time the mountain-top-view is shown and we see how many days have passed since the beginning.<br /><br />i don't know which is worse: this or http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0189456/...
