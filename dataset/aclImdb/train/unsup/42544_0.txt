I only regret that they don't allow negative ratings on here. Here's my plot spoiler: successful couple, man gets on coke, loses job, does more coke, loses marriage, house, does more coke, loses everything else, does more coke, loses everything else else that wasn't in the first everything else, does more coke... the end. I kept thinking SOMETHING would happen, but no, I was wrong.<br /><br />I saw this movie when it first came out, over 20 years ago, and have continuously referred to it as the worst movie ever made. I guess I should really see it again to confirm that I still feel that way all these years later, but I'm not willing to go through that ordeal.<br /><br />Anyone that had anything to do with this movie should be banned from movies or TV or anything else for life. That is all.
