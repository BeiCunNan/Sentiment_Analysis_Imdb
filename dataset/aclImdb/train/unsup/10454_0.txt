I'v watched the TV show Hex twice over and I still can not get enough of it. The show is excellent and would range from people my age which is 13 to people as old as 82. The show is an excellent combination of drama, comedy, romance and thriller. <br /><br />My personnel comment on the best character in the show would have to be Telma, because she doesn't care what any one things of her. She is a lesbian ghost and proud to be one.<br /><br />The show is sometimes compared to Buffy or Charmed but both of those shows don't have the specialness that Hex has. I now they all are about demons and chosen ones but I would gladly watch Hex over and over than watch a marathon of Charmed or Buffy.<br /><br />I think that the producers of the show should make another 5 to 6 series because at the end they just left you hanging with the characters, because almost anything could happen to them even though Malacky(sorry about my spelling) has taken over the school. I would still like to now if Ella finally gets her revenge and her and Leon finally get to have a normal relationship.
