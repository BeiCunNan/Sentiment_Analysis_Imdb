Where to begin. Let's start with the story. The story was really cheesy and pretty much badly presented. The movie takes `courses' and `turns' that are totally unexplained. Like for instance how Geena can claim that she loves William after spending, oh what? 2 hours with him. No not even that. She met him 2 hours ago, took an order of burgers and beer from him, helped him clean up a mess on the floor and now she loves him. Very convincing. This is just one of the examples of totally unexplained things in this movie. The effort has been spent on making `cool scenes' with a bit of shoot out and `die hard conversation'. By which I mean `cool' things to say to the cool scenes. The work on combining these scenes have been totally overlooked.<br /><br />Sure, there are some glimpses and funny moments. But not enough to make up for the one and a half hours the movie tortured my eyes.<br /><br />The acting is just horrible as well, at least from most of the actors. But then again a director who can make a movie out of a story this bad probably wouldn't give the actors any hints on what to do either. Most of the things are `over done' so bad that it's nothing but cheesy. The bad guy is so very very bad that it becomes silly.<br /><br />Some of the special effects are pretty good though, which is why I gave this movie 3 instead of 1 (or maybe 2). Nicely done monster masks and life like gore/blood. But that pretty much this movie can offer.<br /><br />To be quite honest with you, I wouldn't recommend you renting this movie even if it's the last one on the rack. I wouldn't recommend anyone buying it since I think it's a waste of resources clogging up a DVD or VHS-cassette with it. I wouldn't recommend watching it on TV if it's on. What I do recommend is that you stay away from this movie if it's possible.
