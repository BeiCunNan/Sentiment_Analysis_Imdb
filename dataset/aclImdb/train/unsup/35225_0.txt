Isn't it strange that almost all bad movies concern goblins of some sort? The best way to watch this movie is to get everyone you know and play the Troll 2 drinking game that a clever IMDB member submitted with his comment. You may die, but it'll be worth it. There are many hilarious scenes in Troll 2, but I won't spoil them. Most of the hilarity relies in the absolutely dismal acting and incomprehensibly awful dialogue (Including the classic 'Nilbog is goblin spelt backwards'). The special effects are also very funny, most notably the spear throwing scene. And the funniest scene of all is the supposedly erotic scene, involving a woman with a corn cob. Only bad movie fans need apply. If you liked Hobgoblins, you'll love Troll 2. 10/10
