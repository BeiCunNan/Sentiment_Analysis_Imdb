I am a very late comer to Bernie Mac TV show. I know I have passed it by on many occasions and written it off at first glance as just one more lame formula sitcom. But owing to the fact that it is in reruns at the very time I go to bed and am ready to watch TV at the end of the day, I finally sat through an episode. And I have been a huge fan ever since.<br /><br />You know, it really isn't like anything else I've seen. The only possible comparison I can make is to the Bill Cosby show, because it leaves me with that same feeling of well-being and makes me laugh. There is some serious sophisticated wit at work in the writing, and they've taken what couldn't sound more like a tired plot and just twisted it into something completely fresh. The writing incorporates some very modern scenarios (example: Baby Girl got on the internet just looking for pictures of some pussycats....you can guess the rest) but incorporates them in ways that seem realistic and timely instead of contrived and trendy with a short shelf-life.<br /><br />I'm loving Bernie Mac and all the characters on the show. It's just a great balance of unique humor, honesty, and warmth.
