This movie was.... interesting. It was overall quite novel, but it suffered from a couple of draw backs.<br /><br />The first is that while the alien female cast is definitely attractive (and I am not saying the human cast isn't), but it appears as if someone had instructed them to try and act seductively while playing a part and they just end up coming across like the actors in the crappy porn movies my flatmates used to find amusing. This is generally OK, but it really gets annoying in some places.<br /><br />Also, if you were hoping for a "Species" or an "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", you will be a little disappointed. The storyline in most places is fairly obvious, although there are a couple of features which make it different enough to make the film not a complete waste of time.<br /><br />Other than this, the special effects are certainly fair, the acting is decent (barring the notes above) and it's definitely watchable. It might not be a movie I would recommend to others as one to search out and watch, but if you have some time to kill or it's on TV there are a lot of other movies that are way worse than this.
