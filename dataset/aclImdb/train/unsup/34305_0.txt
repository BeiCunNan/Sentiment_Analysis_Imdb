A Maniratam movie, mostly shot in day light? Was it because Aishwarya and Abhishek had other business after sunset? A confident village bloke, Guru, quickly becomes a famous textile businessman before its time for intermission. The rest of the movie is a upsurge to Guru's grand yet powerless argument in the courtroom. Good costumes for Abhishek especially while he is at Turkey. His hit formula is definitely to imitate senior as much as possible by trying a Paan Banaras Waala type song and also by being biased to his left hand. With Aishwarya, if you removed the background from any song sequence, it is hard to tell which movie she is dancing for. Continuing the same 'see-my-hip-can-go-over-my-belly-button' step from Jeans to Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam to Guru, she has conveniently let Mallika's dance to slip up to the best dance in the movie. After Alzheimers in Black and several on Schizophrenia, it was time to introduce the Indian audience to another neurological disease in the form of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). While MS dawns during the 20s, Vidya Balan seems be limping from the age of 10. It is interesting how she predicts her d-day to be 420 days while the course of this disease is considered highly unpredictable with most people living a full life sans quality. I guess the attempt was to pull a Zameer (from Munna Bhai) for the sake of drama. Apart from such technical blemish, i think it is a good attempt towards awareness. In summary, one has the option of taking their extended family to a nearby theater to watch Guru, or use that money saved to buy some shares in Reliance. Eitherways, you will see Udhyan Mukharjee commend your decision.
