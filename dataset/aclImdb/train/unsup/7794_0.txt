Strange Illusion is a movie I tried to watch, but just couldn't make it all the way through. It comes off as an extremely poor attempt at a Hitchcock type movie.<br /><br />The storyline itself is kind of interesting, but several factors really overwhelm that and drag the movie down:<br /><br />1) the bad acting of the lead character and his teenage friends 2) the unrealistic old fashioned gee-whiz dialogue 3) simplistic camerawork 4) inappropriate and dated music in a number of scenes<br /><br />There were some scenes where the music was appropriate and added a lot of tension of the situation. However, too often you were subjected to some very annoying violin music that was not needed and detracted from the experience.<br /><br />I gave it an honest try, but never bothered watching it all the way through. It really was that bad...
