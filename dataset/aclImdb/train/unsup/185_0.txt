Since the first time I saw this wonderful film on late-night TV, maybe 30 years ago, it has been my sentimental favorite. Every time I've seen it since, once a year on average, it's made me weep; not many films ever have this effect on me, even once. I simply don't understand why it isn't better known, not to mention better regarded. The touching story, fine direction, good score and superb acting add up to a great experience. For me, the performances by Claudette Colbert and Orson Welles are their most effective; hers ranks with her work in "Three Came Home" and "Since You Went Away," while his is even finer than in "The Stranger." Anyone who loves a good old-fashioned love story, sob story, multi-generational saga of the type Hollywood used to make so well should give this one a try.
