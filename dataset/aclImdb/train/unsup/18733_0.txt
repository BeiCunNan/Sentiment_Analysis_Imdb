Ah, memories, sweet memories. I recall pulling into the movie theater parking lot with scant seconds to spare before YOR was to begin. I wanted to see YOR because of its title. It also was the only movie starting when we arrived, to be truthful. YOR was magnificently, superbly bad and one of the worst Italian muscle men films in history. And since this was released in the 1980s, our Italian friends threw in a little STAR WARS shtick in the second half for good measure. Reb "Captain America" Brown as Yor is an insult to actors everywhere. The special effects are laughable, on a par with a high school production. Everything you have read elsewhere about this film is true. I still can recall Brown fighting the head -- but not the body -- of a raptor and some bizarre gliding nonsense and a poorly executed laser battle near the end. I have seen some real stinkers in my time, but this one pretty much takes the cake. My wife and I and company snorted and chortled our way through the whole thing, which beat crying. YOR is a must-see for Z-grade film lovers everywhere! Remember those awful sword and sorcery flicks with the guy who played Tarzan in the late 70s? Remember that particular Tarzan flick? YOR is worse. But entertaining in a trashy way.
