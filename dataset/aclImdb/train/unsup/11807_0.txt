Surprisingly fresh for a relatively unknown director , perhaps , the best ultra-real action film of the year , 1000% better then self-proclaimed pure action like Wanted !A story of an abduction of the US president , played by great W. Hurt, is somehow reminiscent of the following genre of macabre war thrillers : The Domino Principle , The Parallax View , Enemy of the State , except that it is told from different perspectives, thus the title ! Great acting by everyone ( D. Quaid is brilliant as always ) , fast-paced camera angles , and great car chase, totally believable with Opel cars !The only minus to this film if you like waiting for the end credits : it was made in Mexico and not in Spain 's Salamanca , but still convincing ! Perhaps one of the best films of the year !
