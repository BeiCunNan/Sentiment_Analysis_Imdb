This movie makes no bones about what it is and wants to be. A return to the 80s slasher flicks. A plot that movies things forward without being pretentious or deep. Plenty of eye candy. A horrific monster that does what he is supposed to do, kill up everything in sight for disturbing the lands. All the good things a slasher movie needs to be. <br /><br />Most of all, it was FUN. I get the sense that the case and crew had an absolute blast in making this movie. <br /><br />I won't say which but there is this one other movie which purports to goes back to those days, but with a super high budget pretending to be low budget. It fails because it feels like a carefully researched numbers crunched cheese substitute. It didn't have the heart of classic low budget.<br /><br />Dark Walker is the real thing, a FUN low budget popcorn movie. Hang out with your date and friends at a drive in for this one. <br /><br />I got this one based on the name of a great actor and acquaintance, Chuck Williams. Took 2 years to finally watch it but darned glad I did. Chuck, you got a fun movie here!<br /><br />And awaiting the sequel with baited (no anchovy) breath!
