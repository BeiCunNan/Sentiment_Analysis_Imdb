Boy, they just don't make them like this one anymore. Thank God for that! This is a pathetically dreary film about a "gang" of drug smugglers and their not-so-funny misadventures as they are hounded by the Georgia State Patrol while first in a beat up camper and then a huge rig. I would guess that at least half of the film is made up of lame chases, which is considerably better than having the acting "leads" on screen for any time at all. The police are portrayed as complete idiots as they have multiple cars unable to derail a camper until a fifteen minute chase has ended - only to have the "gang" break out of prison by a helicopter. The two leads are long-haired non-actors Don Watson and Bobby Watson playing Oosh and Boosh. They are criminals with no redeeming attributes and live to have a joint. The other performers are just as talented with some really bad turns by the likes of James Crews as "Bubble Eye, " Sandy St. Armour as the head of "the Organization, " and in the most ridiculous role we have Jim Whozitt(sometimes credited as Big Jim - c'mmon this is the only film he ever did) as the Pilot. He is flying to Columbia to get 10 million's worth in cocaine and pot and wears the most God-awful sansabelt slacks even for the 70's. This is a bad movie all around and very amateurish, but unlike other inept efforts in film-making - this one is just no fun at all to sit through. It plods on and on, trying to funny in some spots and failing miserably. It fails when it tries to shock a few times as well. This makes the Smokey and the Bandit series almost look like art.
