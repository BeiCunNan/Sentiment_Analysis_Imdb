Another brain dead selection from the production company Asylum. LEGION OF THE DEAD attempts to mix mummy movie with sexploitation flick. The result, hardly a first, looks like an inferior remake of the much-maligned LIFEFORCE. This time, instead of a naked space-vampire chick that sucks the lifeforce out of entranced males, we get a naked mummy-vampire chick that sucks the lifeforce out of entranced males.<br /><br />Calling this movie a rip-off would be a compliment, however. It would ignore how really bad this film is. Unconvinced? Think about this: the best feature of the movie is the bad acting.<br /><br />So what are we left with? There's laughable CGI. A "legion of the dead" that amounts to a few badly made up mummies. An Egyptian tomb set that appears to have been made of cardboard (but perhaps that's how California's ancient Eyptians once constructed them). I kid you not, people. This tomb was discovered in the woods of Southern California. And don't make me start on the script. Please. I don't want to think about it in any kind of detail.<br /><br />Worst of all, I saw this damn thing on the Sci-Fi Channel, so the main reason for its existence (the nudity) was edited/blurred out.
