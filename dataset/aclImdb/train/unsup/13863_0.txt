L'IL ABNER is a minor classic from the golden age of musicals. Dogpatch and its denizens are stylistically realized in this comic-strip of a film. Peter Palmer (Abner), Billie Hayes (Mammy Yokum) and Stubby Kaye (Marryin' Sam), among others, bring the eccentric citizens of this burg to musical life with humor and vitality. Among the best songs are "Jubilation T. Cornpone," "The Country's in the Very Best of Hands," and the "Rag Off'n the Bush" dance. Put your Sondheim sophistication aside and enjoy this wonderfully down-home parody of government and backwoods folk.
