How often does a great song and a lousy song come out of the same movie. "Shakedown" by Bob Seger was nominated for an Academy Award for best song, while "I Want Your Sex" by George Michael won a Raqzzie for the worst song of the year.<br /><br />But, it's not about the song, it's about the actors. Here we have the gang back from Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy), a hipper Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), Capt.Bogomil (Ronny Cox) and Sgt. Taggart (John Ashton, and Inspector Todd (Gilbert R. Hill).<br /><br />This time the evil villain is the lovely Brigitte Nielsen.<br /><br />Not as funny as the original, but still has plenty of laughs and action as the team solves the Alphabet Crimes.
