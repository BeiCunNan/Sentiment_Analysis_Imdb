I didn't know it was possible to make a picture this terrible. Not only is the movie not scary in the slightest sense, but also the bad parts of it that are often so funny in other horror movies are completely dull in this one. If you read the movie title and thought it sounded lame, you've basically gotten all the emotion this one can muster and shouldn't waste your time actually watching this flop.
