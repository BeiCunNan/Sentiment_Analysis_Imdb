Good thriller about a couple who hire a guide to take them into the into the desert canyons only to have to all go wrong.<br /><br />The less said the better, not because its bad, rather because its the sort of film that is best left to its own devices. Its also the sort of film that you've seen variations on before. Normally that would make for a dull little film but the combination of characters and location (the photography is great) make for a really good little film.I liked it. Is it perfect? No. Its probably too long, but other than that its a good little film to pas the time. This is also a film thats going to be better on DVD rather than in the theaters where one is a bit more forgiving of the flaws.
