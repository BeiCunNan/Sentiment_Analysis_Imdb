The movie had a great plot and moved at a fast pace that kept me on the edge of the seat. I loved the action and the driving I thought was kept realistic.<br /><br />Dennis Hopper proves he still has it. He was a perfect choice for this movie. The grandson of a ex-con and his sexy girl friend "JJ" made a good balance. The choice the writer had for keeping the secret on the car was so unique. My hats off for this choice. The whole time while watching this I found that I couldn't predict the next thing and I like that in a movie. Hopper made me remember "EasyRider" and why he became popular. I hope to see him choose some more roles like this one.
