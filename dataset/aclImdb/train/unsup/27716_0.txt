Crippled Granddaddy Crockett and his family of whiners want to poison all the reptiles on his remote island estate. And the frogs? Well, let's just say they're not too happy about it. Neither are their scaley buddies, and they advance on the unsuspecting family with a vengeance. I saw this movie at the cinema when I was 12 and thought it was creepy. I just saw it again at 41 and I still think it's great. It deserves a retroactive Oscar or something. A high point is when pink and frilly Aunt Iris goes out butterfly hunting with net and gets pursued by hissing snakes. And when what's-his-name gets strangled by killer moss while hairy spiders eat him alive...well, that's just pure class. The younger members of the cast run around in skin-tight bell bottomed hip huggers and there's even a Foxy Black Mama with a psychedelic turban thrown in for fun. Cool! Not as good as "Let's Scare Jessica To Death" or "The Wicker Man", but still a must-see for people who are into this low-tech type of thing (like me). There's even a flesh-eating turtle! Long live the seventies!
