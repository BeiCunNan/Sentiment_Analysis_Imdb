I've watched this movie countless times and never get bored. It provides sheer entertainment and some of the best one-liners I've heard in a movie. It is equal opportunity in its derogatory remarks and racism, and that's part of the charm. People get too worked up over stereotypes and "being offended" but they shouldn't -- this is a movie, not a political commentary. The actors have done a superb job of creating humour out of an awkward situation -- two men who happen to be gay, live together, own a business and must "play it straight" for the benefit of their son's in-laws.<br /><br />I think I understand why the critical review has been mediocre -- it's likely because critics keep comparing 'The Birdcage' with the original 'La Cage Aux Folles'. I wish critics would rate a movie for what it is, and not for what it compares to. 'The Birdcage' as a stand-alone movie is witty, funny, silly, and entertaining. And that's what makes it so enjoyable! It's one of my favourite comedies and I can watch it over and over again.
