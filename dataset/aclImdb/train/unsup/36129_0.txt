absurdly overrated vehicle for Marin county anorexics, of interest<br /><br />only to older men charmed by, but largely excluded from, the<br /><br />pretentions of the privileged young. also, of course, to historians of<br /><br />the lesser directors of the old new wave.<br /><br />the mannered failure of the principal actress to - well - act is<br /><br />insupportable, and the annoyance is not decreased by a sense<br /><br />that the director doesnt particularly care, in fact might prefer it that<br /><br />way. the looseness of his direction is only pointed by the<br /><br />conspicuousness of passages in which actual actors rebel, and<br /><br />introduce verve.<br /><br />in short, a film for the voyeur.<br /><br />
