This is far and away, one of, if not the worst movie I have ever watched... I say watched, as I had to stop half an hour in as it was so bad, I couldn't stand to watch any more! I enjoyed the first one, but this was just absolute gash; it seemed that they tried to copy the characters from the original movie (which was enjoyable enough) with newer, different versions- and they failed miserably. It seems that a lot of the movie has been dubbed for some reason(?) and that the cast have been told to act as badly as they possibly can- which they have all excelled at spectacularly! I can't deride this movie- and its terrible CGI/Special(!) effects enough. 30 minutes of my life that I'll never get back! On the plus side, at least I didn't watch it all!!! Shockingly bad!
