Before god awful pieces of trash like The Punisher, there was another film that showed a man who's wife was murdered by a gang and wanted justice, but wanted to deliver it in his own way. That film was Death Wish. And instead of a hero that didn't seem to care too much about this killing (though it was mostly just the actor, Tom Jane)we had the cool three dimensional Charles Bronson. You may ask yourself, "three dimensional?". And I say "sure" he cried about his wife before he went on to kill a great many scum bags on the streets of New York. The bottom line is that Bronson was a bad ass in this film and all the rest of the Death Wish films which I also enjoy very much. We know that this movie will be great from the beginning when Bronson cashes in a 20 dollar bill for two rolls of quarters so that he can stuff them in a sock and smash it across some dude's face. It's brilliant. They don't do they kind of raw action in movies anymore, and I guess that's why this movie can be so refreshing even if it was made in the seventies. There's no doubt that anyone who appreciates good action flicks with a bad ass main character will appreciate THIS movie the way I do.
