I've read about this film before, & was interested in it despite the fact that most everything I read said it was bad....but I generally LIKE bad movies, that is, ones that have entertainment value other than what was intended.<br /><br />So, here we have the checklist of positive elements: 1) Howard Vernon 2) A Creepy Castle 3) A Foggy Forest 4) Lots of Bare Breasts 5) A house-servant that talks like Boris Badenov 6) Open Heart Surgery 7) A guy in a dancing bear suit. So, given all those elements, put them all together, and what do you get? Uh, a really, really, abysmal movie.<br /><br />We have a bunch of spoiled rich party-goers who decide to go horseback riding (despite the fact that they were blind drunk a few moments before), and of course they get lost in the woods & happen across the mysterious castle of one Graf Saxon, whose daughter just happened to get raped & dies. Seems that once upon a time, his ancestor had the same problem & to bring his dead daughter back he just slew his mistress & used her blood, etc. And of course, The Graf stands on family tradition. And, coincidentally, one of the young folks that showed up at the castle resembles his daughter, will wonders never cease.<br /><br />There's some extensive scenes of open heart surgery, for whatever that's worth, because it's not clear who its on nor who is doing it, but it's about par for the course with this film. And one of the young folks decides to go for help & gets attacked by a guy in a bear suit, which quite possibly could not look more fake.<br /><br />So, this had all the elements of a good movie, and this also had a lot of elements of a "so bad it's good movie", so I have to wonder...how did it turn out to be just plain BAD? 2 out of 10. When you read bad things about this film, believe them.
