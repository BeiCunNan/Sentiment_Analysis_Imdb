This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I believe everyone involved in its production was cynically motivated by greed and hubris, and possibly large quantities of pharmaceuticals. There was not enough sex in this to elevate it to the level of a "3" or "4" rating out of 10 possible. Further evidence that centipedes will outlast us.<br /><br />IMDb requires that I write 10 lines of text. What further commentary could possibly illuminate you as to the childish and silly nature of this movie? Escape now while you have the chance. I like escapism and "bad" movies if they have some qualities worthy of redemption. All I can say about this one is that the bad girl whose large boobies dangle in the exercise sequence was sexy in a very dirty way. And then she was gone.<br /><br />So will we all be. Let this not be the legacy of the human species.
