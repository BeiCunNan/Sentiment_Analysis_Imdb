I've always enjoyed the Monkees, but this my friends,mind you is a disgrace! It makes me vomit to see how grossly inarcurate it is! Mike was Christian Scientist, what's he doing letting Philyss stay in the hospital, and who could there be two guys, not that ass, Van, and why did they hire a 5'7 Bulgarian with a minturized doughnut surgically put in his chin play Davy? The 1967 Comedy Emmy was presented by a little girl (Buffy from Family Affair), not a full grown woman, and don't get me started on Jimi Hendrix and the ending and lots of other things?
