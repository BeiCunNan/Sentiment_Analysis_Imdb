<br /><br />There are a few positive elements to mention here... Nicole Paggi is completely hot. Nicole Paggi and Myles Jeffrey play brother and sister, and in real life they look alike enough to make playing brother and sister seem fairly realistic. Last, the older actors do a very good job with what they have to work with.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are many negative aspects to mention. Very poor production values -- the special effects and the hospital ER/operating room sets were very weak. The editing was poor. At times there is a lack of continuity between cuts.<br /><br />Myles Jeffrey can't act yet, and his eye movements during times when other actors are feeding him lines are distracting.<br /><br />There is a Georgia accent, a Long Island accent, a Left Coast accent... but no Vermont accents.<br /><br />The story and plot come with more holes than Swiss cheese. Annoyingly, each of the many brief periods of hail falling is paired with a character spontaneously confessing some deep dark secret to whoever is near. Hail attack / confession, hail attack / confession, repeat five or six times, etc. <br /><br />Watch this expecting it to be a small town high school play production, and you might not seem all that bad.
