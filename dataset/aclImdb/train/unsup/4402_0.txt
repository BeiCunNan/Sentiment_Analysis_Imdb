I had the extreme displeasure of attending the opening premiere of this film down at the Lowe's Waterfront theaters. One my way out of the theater, the woman woman behind the DVD sales booth asked if I wanted to buy a DVD copy. I quickly cried, "Hell no! I'll make a better one." Everyone posting positive comments about this film must have been directly involved in making (or even more painfully, funding) this production. Horrible writing. Horrible lighting. Horrible set design. Horrible technical work. Horrible acting. Horrible structure. Horrible concept. Horrible result. This trash is my answer whenever I'm asked, "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" Close this browser window right now and never give this movie another thought. You're welcome.
