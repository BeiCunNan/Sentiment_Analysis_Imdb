This has to be the worst Jones film of all time. What was he thinking? Guess maybe back in 1988 he didn't know he would be as big as he is today and just took any part he could get. Takes the good with the bad. I really had to try not to turn the tape off; half the time you're wondering why they put this certain scene in there. If for some reason in your life you don't get the chance to watch this, your not missing much.
