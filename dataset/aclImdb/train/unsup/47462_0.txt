This movie was boring. It was like every bad date I ever had. Every painful date. Ugh! It went on and on through an entire evening of a third date trying to decide whether they should be honest about who they really are or just sleep together and avoid the realities of life. It was painful as he tried to get her into bed. He lost his likability as he kept pushing her into it. I saw no chemistry between them, it's like they had been married forever. Could I relate to this sequence? Yes! But was it entertaining? NO! Sorry, but I felt I wasted an evening on this. And I love Paul Reiser! The ending was nice but it took a long time to get there. I hope this helps someone, I write this because if I had read this, I would have saved my evening!
