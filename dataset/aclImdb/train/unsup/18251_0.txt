A film of a young girl who lives in a bordello and becomes a prostitute. Set in New Orleans the film is suitable filled with jazz music. The seedy atmosphere and the decadent opium smoking madam are superb.<br /><br />Brook shield his as beautiful as ever. I don't know how this film got past the censor especially the naked shots. The auction scene is bizarre and sordid. <br /><br />Brook forms a relationship with a pedophile who "rescues her". The film shows there relationship and conflicts. I think it shows a reality that existed and still exists today. Well worth seeing.<br /><br />The age difference shows in that she is still a child and wants to play rather than behave like an adult.
