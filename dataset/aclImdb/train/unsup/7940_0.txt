This was one of the infamous video nasties that was banned in Britain. It was released there in 1993 with just 3 seconds cut.<br /><br />I am not a Spanish expert, but Week of the Killer is a more accurate translation of the Spanish title: La semana del asesino.<br /><br />Vicente Parra is Marcos, who works in a slaughterhouse. If you don't like scenes of animal slaughter, be warned. He gets into an argument one night with a cabbie (Goyo Lebrero) and hits him with a rock, killing him. His girlfriend Paula (Emma Cohen) wants him to go to the police, but he has other plans. Now, he has two bodies under his bed. At least he had one last night of fun with the luscious Barcelona beauty.<br /><br />He tells his brother Nestor (Eusebio Poncela), who sings the same song as Paula, and now there are three. That apartment is going to be stinking soon! Nestor's fianc√©e (Lola Herrera) comes looking for him and unfortunately for her, she finds him. The kills are getting more and more bloody. He seems to be enjoying it now, even if he is becoming anxious.<br /><br />The future father-in-law shows up looking for his daughter. I imagine this kill is the 3 seconds they cut from the British release. That room is getting rather full and flies are buzzing.<br /><br />I remember that old Johnny Cash song "One Piece at a Time, where he snuck Cadillac parts out of the plant in his lunch pail. Well Marcos decides to smuggle in a bagful at a time to the plant and mix it with the beef in the hamburger machine. He better get hustling as the neighborhood dogs are gathering at his door, and he will go broke buying air freshener and cologne.<br /><br />Rosa (Vicky Lagos) is hot for Marcos, and so is Estaban (Charly Bravo). One dies and the other lives, even after Marcos discovers his secret is no longer secret.<br /><br />Again, it is a misnomer to call this Cannibal Man, and I hated to have to watch a dubbed version, but Vicente Parra and Charly Bravo did an excellent job, while Emma Cohen was a real delight in this neo noir Spanish thriller.
