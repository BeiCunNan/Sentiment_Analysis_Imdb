Man this is AWFUL! <br /><br />You're dropped right into the deep end of a very cheap looking movie & given a female vampire & a 1st death VERY early into the film (the opening credits hadn't even finished!) & a stupid hand to hand fight (why bother when you've got a handgun?).<br /><br />The vampire's easy death looked far too fake & predictably was. If they were trying to say praying over water makes it holy (sorry, you need a high level priest to bless water to make it holy) then that's just bad research.<br /><br />Cutting to the diner and the acting in there was truly awful indeed. The guy playing the clueless highway patrol officer is a dire actor, not once does he return fire when shot at.<br /><br />The girl playing the special agent generally over-acts in most of the scenes she's in and the whole film seems very much like it was made by students as an end of year project. The whole "scared of mice" thing seemed like it wasn't going to go anywhere.<br /><br />I do agree that the incidental music is just plain awful and clearly added on very late in production as an after thought. We are finally given an explanation that German Zombies from WW2 are hunting down and killing the Americans that killed them. Yes, a stupid idea for a plot but it's certainly never been done before.<br /><br />The very notion that they'd recognise people after 60 yrs has passed is one of the minor plot flaws. The fact that their uniforms are in such great condition is another one.<br /><br />The reason for the dead Germans wanting revenge is how they were mistreated before they were killed and it seems they can only be killed by the WW2 weapons. In the final encounter the local cop is bitten and infected and the special agent goes 1 on 1 with the last German Zombie (why she pulls her modern gun on him I don't know) but it seems the final Zombie has a death wish and is strangled by the last living GI.<br /><br />We find out that the special agent herself is a Zombie and she cures the local cop and she advises him to join her in the fight against monsters.<br /><br />Bad ending to a truly awful film
