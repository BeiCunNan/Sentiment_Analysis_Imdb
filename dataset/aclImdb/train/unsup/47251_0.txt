If it is possible to fit more clichés into a movie than should logically fit in its runtime, Rebound boldly has some claim to success. Since I work at a movie theater, I was paid 6.50 an hour to watch this two hour film, and it was barely sufferable. Rebound doesn't really have characters; there are just static, singularly-painted figures that we can't root for because it follows every sports film cliché in the book, meaning the audience knows in the first five minutes how everything will turn out before the characters even get there. Any attempt to surprise us takes the back seat to the tried and true method of formulaic storytelling that ruins this film.<br /><br />I will admit that the actors and actresses in this film seemed very talented, but because of the absent values of the film, didn't have a good outlet for their craft. The talent (perhaps minus Martin Lawrence) would succeed in a project with more vitality. And periodically, there are one or two funny moments (some of which are accidents like boom mics falling into the shot). But there is absolutely no reason to see this film in light of the other films that are out, including War of the Worlds. If your kids want to see something, at least spare them this and go to Madagascar or something less offensively routine.<br /><br />Conclusion: Utter waste of money, time, and awkward jokes. You couldn't pay me to watch this again.
