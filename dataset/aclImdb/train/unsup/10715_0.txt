I totally related to this movie! Being a little theater nerd all through high school I always felt left from most of my classmates, but this movie.. this is what it should have been like for me. <br /><br />The movie overall may be a little formulaic, but it has a definite message of acceptance and overcoming obstacles. No matter who you are, you will find meaning within this movie. I think many people wrote it off too soon and possibly without seeing it. With the advent of the movie musical, Camp may have come out too soon. Great recommendation if you liked Rent. <br /><br />am spreading the word about this movie to all of my friends!
