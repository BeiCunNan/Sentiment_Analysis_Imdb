Just watched this film and it is not an objective representation of life in Buenos Aires. It is clearly subjective and 100% racist. Check out the opening soccer sequence with its skewed perspective and you get the picture.<br /><br />In general terms, it's all low grade B&W mud just like this poor excuse of a film. From the beginning till the end... the script and filmmaker's POV perpetuates separation between countries and cultures.<br /><br />Ultimately, what makes this story thematically xenophobic is that the Bolivian protagonist is murdered with no accountability, thus the filmmaker's message is... that's it's okay to be a racist.<br /><br />How would the Director like it if we made a movie about crack whores from Montevideo working in Buenos Aires and called it... URUGUAY?
