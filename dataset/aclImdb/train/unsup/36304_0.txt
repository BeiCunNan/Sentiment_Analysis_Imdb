The reason this movie has twenty alternate titles is because Tobe Hooper and the film's distributors wanted to combat the terrible word-of-mouth that would inevitably arise once the film was shown to unsuspecting audiences. That's how bad this movie is--even its creators were ashamed of it.<br /><br />Don't ask me what Tobe Hooper was thinking with this movie. One of these days I'll track him down and ask him about it. "Hey Tobe, why did you think we wanted to see a movie with Robert Englund as a sodomy-obsessed nutcase and a filty, rundown hotel with an obvious psychopath for a proprietor and a random, fake-looking alligator?" Maybe Hooper was drunk on the success of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Maybe he was just drunk. I don't know. But this seriously has to be one of the worst, most unbearable films of all time.<br /><br />In TCM you could sorta believe what was going on. Here we have what is probably the worst, least inviting hotel on the planet, but somehow people keep showing up and checking in. Are you people crazy? Just freakin' LOOK at that place! And look at the crazy guy with a scythe who runs it! And look at the giant alligator in the diseased swamp out front! Gee, honey, this place looks nice...<br /><br />For some reason the sky is red throughout almost the entire film. Is it supposed to be on Mars?
