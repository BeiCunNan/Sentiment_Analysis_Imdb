aside from the visually stunning shots of the ocean and skydiving this film has some major fundamental flaws. the major problem was many of the scenes failed to make sense. for example when johnny is chasing the ex presidents in his car after they had robbed a bank why did he not call for backup to cut them off? thats the first thing any officer on any level would do. secondly i never understood how they figured out it was surfers committing the crimes. they claimed it was because of wax on their shoes? wax could get there by any number of ways. lastly, how did johnny know where the robbers were going after the final robbery? he was never told by bodie, in fact he deliberately kept it from him. don't waste your 2 hours on this, read a book.
