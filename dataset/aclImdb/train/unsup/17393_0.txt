This movie includes a little bit of everything you look for in a movie: love, laughter, hate, tragedy. What makes this story so beautiful is the puppy love between the protagonists Renata and Ulises. While watching the movie, you want to scream at the parents and Renata's sister for being so ignorant and stuck up. I do recommend this movie for Romeo and Juliet movie lovers- you know, the whole "we belong with each other no matter what the world says" movie. I think Martha Higadera and Luis Fernando Pena do a realistic job making us believe that they are head over heels in love. I should say that the way they met is also very realistic. I just wish that money wouldn't dictate whom we can and cannot love, ya know? -christian
