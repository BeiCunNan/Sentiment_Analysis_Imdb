I watched this whole series on TV and have most of it on tape and think it's the finest, most realistic and most involving series about prisoners under the Japanese during WWII. I've seen almost every film and tv series made on this subject and TENKO is the best!<br /><br />The actors are consistently wonderful and their circumstances truly harrowing. Anyone who is interested in what prisoners-of-war (and in this case, particularly women) went through will love this show.<br /><br />I just wish it were available on tape in the US. My tapes were made from television and the quality is poor. I would buy this in a minute if it came in the format used here.
