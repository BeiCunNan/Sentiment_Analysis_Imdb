What a horrible piece of dreck. The plot is non-existing, the actors are stupid lame and incoherent (as was the non-existing plot), the camera-work something my little sister could pull off, the dude who seeger recruiters has got to be the MOST annoying person _EVER_. I couldn't stop thinking about smacking him in the face every time he opened his mouth. Apart from that he overacts when the dude can't even act, he pronounces every sentence with incredible agony, thinking it probably raises his 'acting' skills to a higher plane and makes him look even a more bad guy. IT IS HORRIBLE.<br /><br />The main actor has gotten even fatter then previously, and now takes about 2/3 of my widescreen TV. What a waste of perfectly good film and time of my life. <br /><br />Seriously though, i you know what the film is about please tell me. I would like to know. Because the movie sure didn't!
