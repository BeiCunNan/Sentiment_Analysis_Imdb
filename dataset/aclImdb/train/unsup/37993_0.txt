Cheap, silly porno spoof of Flash Gordon. Flesh and Dale Ardor with Dr. Felix Jerkoff (ho ho) go to the planet Porno (where else?) and face off against the evil Wang and try to get...something. I don't know. I got bored and fell asleep.<br /><br />I saw the extended DVD version. There's no hardcore stuff but tons of nudity, a fairly explicit lesbian sequence and (surprisingly) a gay sequence! The jokes are all terrible, stupid sound effects are heard throughout, lousy music and terrible acting across the board. And, seriously, Jason Williams really should of worked out more seeing he's nude most of the time and is the hero. This movie thinks it's really funny--but it isn't.<br /><br />There is some excellent stop-motion animation monsters here but they're pretty brief and not enough to save the movie.<br /><br />Might be funny if you're dead drunk. Rock bottom--DO NOT SEE!!!!
