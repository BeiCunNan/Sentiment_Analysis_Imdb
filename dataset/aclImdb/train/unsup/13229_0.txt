Fans of both "The Six Million Dollar Man" and "The Bionic Woman", can rest assure this dream has come true. I've enjoyed both series, and having them back together would be a dream come true. I first heard about on "Entertainment Tonight" ahead of times. I was really jacked up to wait. When I saw the preview, I was ecstatic! With the updated scenes for the movie was fascinating and just watching it made it more fun. It was funny when Jamie(Lindsay Wagner) threw Steve(Lee Majors) out the window. But the excitement factor was better when Steve landed on the car giving Jamie a chance to escape, while Steve flipped the car, and the car took off after being flipped. Really peculiar! Now his son is a bionic, only he has a lethal laser in his right eye! Talk about out of sight. This reunion movie is out of sight, reliving the old show is great. Action, scifi shows do indeed make better reunion progresses than sitcoms ever will. Maybe... Now I'm going to get some metal pipes and NANANANANANANANANA!!!!!!!!!!!! BIONIC-SIZE THEM! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rating 5 stars!
