This is a solid TV movie look horror movie from Universal who specialized at the time in good strong B movies made in Technicolor and released into drive ins and crumbling weekly change houses. In Sydney at the Capitol Theatre 2500 seats were there each session. Often a film like LOST FLIGHT or THE KILLERS or ANGEL IN MY POCKET or COLOSSUS THE FORBIN PROJECT or THE LOVE GOD etc all like that mentioned above from Universal got a berth there for a week inbetween AIP Poe horrors and Paramount reissues. I saw EYE OF THE CAT as a double feature with the Carroll Baker thriller SWEET BODY OF DEBORAH... a terrible title for a good 'is my husband a killer' Euro ski lodge style thriller, very snazzy and in retro, a very good double feature. Today both these films would do very well if new and in multiplexes, then they just had a guest appearance for 6 days (closed Sunday) and off to some remote drive ins in the countryside... never on TV never on video and never heard of again. Read other comments for the excellent well informed reactions and storyline. Hey, what ever happened to Michael Sarrazin? He even was a 70s Streisand leading man in FOR PETE'S SAKE and a great Margo Kidder thriller dude THE REINCARNATION OF PETER PROUD.
