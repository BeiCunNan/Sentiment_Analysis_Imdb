I enjoyed this movie a lot. The lives of the people that used or were associated with the violin were fascinating, along with its near destruction on more than one occasion. Acting was solid all through. I thought the very end was an unnecessary twist that didn't really make a lot of sense. They could've figured out something better. But all in all a good show, worth watching again sometime.
