I thought it was a pointless film, full of r-soles.<br /><br />The acting is okay, but the film left me with a feeling that I had wasted time watching it.<br /><br />The constant, "sir," this and, "sir," that, got on my nerves, and the writer's idea of setting the film in a Yorkshire Grammar School to fool the audience into forgetting that they are all, essentially, a bunch of toffs, didn't work on me.<br /><br />I couldn't wait for this boring, directionless pile of pretentious mung to end, and cannot let anyone else watch this crap, so please believe me, PLEASE!!! Never watch this poor, poor film.
