Never having seen a Butler Brothers Production before, I came into this film fresh and with no bias one way or the other. I'd read both pro and con reviews of their previous movies (ALIVE AND LUBRICATED, BUMS, etc.) and thought these zany brothers might be worth checking out. Having received and watched CONFUSIONS OF AN UNMARRIED COUPLE, I must say that there are both pro and cons in this one little film and, unfortunately, the cons tip the scale a bit too much for a positive rating.<br /><br />The most appealing aspect of the film is undoubtedly the snappy dialogue and the comedy it contains. Watching Dan (Brett Butler) try to sneak his old mattress out his ex-girlfriend's apartment was pretty damn funny (note: this is attempted while his ex is still in the apartment). His comment "We need to talk" while peaking out from behind the would-be stolen mattress is quite hysterical. The downside to the dialogue is its delivery. Brett may be a fine film maker, but he's not an actor. His lines are delivered in queue-card fashion with poor (or little) emotion. Naomi Johnson as Lisa (his ex) does a more admirable job, using both good facial contortions and voice modulation to get her side of the story across.<br /><br />The fact that this is a story about messed up relationships is old territory covered many, many times, too. This accompanied by the continual panning back and forth of the camera during conversations/arguments makes for an old and stilted feel. I'm sure the intention was to give the audience the sense that they were the camera, watching this story unfold, but the effect gets tiring and irritating after a very short time.<br /><br />The other sense (for me, at least) was that I was watching a soft-porn film without the sex. The verbiage was there  the f-word being used liberally, as well as other profanities  and felt abused/overused rather than natural flowing dialogue or shocking. I'm no prude and enjoy the occasional merry chorus of "F-yous", too, but Confusions of an Unmarried Couple went overboard.<br /><br />I understand the budgetary constraints of such a small production and seriously appreciated what Brett and Jason Butler were doing here. They just needed to avail themselves of better filming techniques (i.e., not the continual panning) and find an actor who could play the Dan character with an edgy style, and I feel almost certain that the film would've received much more praise from me ...and perhaps others.
