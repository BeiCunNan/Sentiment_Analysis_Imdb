This film was a remarkable surprise, complicated and charming, intriguing and quite lovely to look at. Not perfect by any means, this film is absorbing right through. It has humor, plot, plot twists, character study, and pathos, but all with a light touch. It was so thoroughly well-done and substantive, I kept thinking it was European, but the accents were American...Ah yes, it was Canadian, that explains the high quality. Three particular bits to note: overall the gay men in the film were effectively portrayed -- no caricatures. Second, the set design and locations were unusual and beautiful without dominating the film. Finally, the (subject of)five senses were nicely interwoven throughout the films -- nothing too heavy-handed. Grab it if you can.
