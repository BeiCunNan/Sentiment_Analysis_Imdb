A classic and one of the funniest films ever made. Directed by Arthur Hiller in that dead-end style of his, (the best that could be said for him was that he knew how to point a camera and keep his actors in front of it), but it's got a cracker of a script by Neil Simon and two of the greatest comic performances ever put on film by Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis.<br /><br />They play two small-town Americans who think promotion and a life in New York is Nirvana itself when in fact it is a hell that even Dante could not envisage and no-one can capture the comedy of escalating awfulness better than Simon, at least in America. In Britain, this is the terrain of Alan Ayckbourne. <br /><br />It's really nothing more than a series of strung together gags but Lemmon and Dennis are great farceurs and Simon knows how to build the jokes one on top of the other. There is nothing original about the film but then who needs originality.
