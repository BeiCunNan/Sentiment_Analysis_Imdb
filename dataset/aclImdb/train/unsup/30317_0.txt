Group of unexcited Catholic school girls, forced to board in for Easter Break decide it would be tons of fun to play with fire when they re-enact ancient voodoo/witchcraft curses. Poor (not to mention obvious) rip-off of THE CRAFT is lame pretty much the whole way through until the surprise climax ending and resolution. But, just because the last 2 minutes before credits is great, I wouldn't say that justifies BLOCKBUSTER rental prices. The movie is still lame.
