STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br /><br />Karl Thommasson (Treat Williams) returns to teach at a tough school after a stint in Kosovo, to honour a promise to a fallen comrade in that war in the shape of taking care of his teacher daughter. He discovers a drug racketeering ring operating in the school and must stop it forthwith.<br /><br />In a role originally written for Tom Berenger, Treat Williams here returns after appearing in the first sequel. He does have a good presence as an action hero (very Steven Seagal) but sadly he is not enough to stop this dreary sequel from emerging as a sad re-hash of the last one, complete with inconsistent villains and a rather surprising lack of action. With this one behind it, I don't hold out much hope for Part 4. **
