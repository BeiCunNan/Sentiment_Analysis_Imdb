Wednesday is movie night for my wife and I, and here lately we've been diving into lesser known ghost movies. This movie caught our attention this last week and we rented it. Oh my, this movie was absolutely horrible. It must have had a budget of about $45. Some parts of it made absolutely NO sense. The "investigator" takes a description of "we drove for 10 minutes, turned left, turned right, crossed some railroad tracks" and was able to drive to the exact spot where this lady was accosted? The acting was sub-par, to the point where I have a theory that the actors were personal friends of the director, so he basically rounded up whoever he could to star in the flick. I see there is a sequel to this using the same actress for the main character. I'll be sure to skip over that one at Blockbuster.
