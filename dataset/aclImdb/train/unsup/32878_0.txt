This is one of the worst movies ever. Each person's dvd/vcr player should ruin the copy before it is done as a service to those who are considering watching the movie. Why? It was boring. It never went anywhere. It was not scary. It was undramatic. I would have rated it a zero, but it was not an option. Actually, it deserves a half point for showing boobs and another half point because Natascha McElhone gets hotter as the movie goes on (BUT THIS IS NOT NEARLY A GOOD ENOUGH REASON TO WASTE ANY TIME ON SEEING THIS MOVIE!!!). So, I rated it as 1 out of 10.<br /><br />Seriously, it depresses me that scripts like these even get read all the way through. Who approves the making of a movie like this? I can't believe that any of the actors'/actresses' careers are that bad that they would agree to acting in something like this. In fact, anyone trying to further their career by taking a part in this movie may have set their career back considerably. Trust me, if I had anything good to say, if there were any redeeming qualities (besides for the boobs and Natascha, of course), I would gladly point them out. Take my word for it, the movie is not worth watching for more than one second and is not worth paying one cent for. This is more of a public service announcement than a review. I care too much about you and your spare time to misguide you into watching this. Have a nice day.
