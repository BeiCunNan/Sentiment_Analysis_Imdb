The first time I watched this movie was on a flight to the States, watching on a very small screen. I still got the lovely story that was beautifully acted. It was not until I bought my own copy of this movie did I fully experience the wonderful scenery and the real feelgood factor of this movie.<br /><br />I seem to want to use words like quaint, nice and warm to describe this film but feel that is doing it an injustice as the ladies of the Womans Institute do have a battle to achieve their goal and the love lives and complications of family all add up to a very good story well told against a wonderful backdrop. It must be remembered that the idea for the calender that sparked the imagination of the public and film makers alike was that of real women in a real Womens Institute group who bared their all to raise money for charity, and it was their idea and bravery that deserves the greatest applause. It shows that real women of all ages are beautiful. Gives me hope that I'm not passed it.
