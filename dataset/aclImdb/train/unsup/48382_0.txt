Sorry but this could have been a good film, the acting was very good, but who wrote the awful script? There was just far too much bad language and I turned the DVD off half way through. I am no prude but does anyone really use the F word THAT much? If so they need help! I was really looking forward to this film because of the good reviews and the fact it was about Salsa ( having Jennifer Lopez to look at doesn't hurt either ) but it really was spoiled. I know that I am probably alone in this but for me constant bad language just grates and it spoils my enjoyment of any film. Some swearing can be justified but it got worse as the film went on. Surely there were better ways to show the decline of a man into drugs than that? For me it is sloppy scriptwriting and even sloppier direction of what could have been a really good biopic.
