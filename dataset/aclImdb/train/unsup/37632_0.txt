The scene where his mum and dad went to bail Blue?? from jail.<br /><br />She was sprinkling Holy water!!!.<br /><br />She was cursing all the demons (in the form of prisoners)to disappear.<br /><br />That scene almost killed me.<br /><br />I actually laughed and ended up weeping.<br /><br />When some of the prisoners heckled her, she shouted at them, "Your Mama, All your mamas".<br /><br />That's one of my fave jail scenes of all time.<br /><br />Get Back Satan.<br /><br />Disappear Demons!!!!!!!!
