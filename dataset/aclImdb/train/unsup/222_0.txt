I can't work out why people didn't enjoy this movie, i thought it was one of the best movies i have ever seen. Compared the the other Ring (Ringu) movies it is not as scary but kind of upsetting, and like the other Ring movies has a great *i have to see more* kinda ending. I actually felt sorry for Sadako in this movie, the same way i felt sorry for Carrie White in Carrie. Also this movie, unlike Ring 2, has a completely new storyline to it, i also thought Yukie Nakama who played Sadako was totally awesome, her acting was just brilliant. The acting from the whole cast was just fantastic. So please try to see this movie, its well worth it, almost as good as the first Ringu!
