If you're a real cinema expert, looking for a great scenario and nice shooting techniques, then you can avoid watching this film, it will make you mad for sure !<br /><br />But if you like 2nd degree humor, if you love stupid fights, sounds, sets and so on, then this film is definitely worth the try !<br /><br />I really enjoy such stupid films because it's so crappy that you can't stop laughing during 90 minutes ! I even wonder how could such films be released in the 80's....The first time I watched it, I couldn't even say any single word, I was amazed and astonished by this incredible movie, I couldn't believe they made that for real !<br /><br />Make your choice !
