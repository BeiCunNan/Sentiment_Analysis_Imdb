How on earth is this film not on the bottom one hundred? it was absolutely terrible. I do not know where to begin. Why would we want to root for Lola? She makes up a name for herself, and is convinced her parents hate her. She gets mad at her parents for not taking her to a concert that reunites a famous band and has really hard to find tickets. She discovers they have sold out tickets, and goes on a HUNGER STRIKE!!! And worst of all, she pretends her Dad is dead, just to get attention! I don't know why she doesn't get on with that Carla girl, they're both brats. The supporting characters look like a way to make it longer, Sam was in it for about five minutes. The animated bits are just weird, and Lola's friend is just ignored for most of the time. Lola hardly ever talks to her. So my advice. Do not watch it. Period.
