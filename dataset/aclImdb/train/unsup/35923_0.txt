Forgive me but I find it well meaning trash.But it is trash. Of course I feel for everyone and yes its clear the health care system is broken but ultimately this movie is more manipulation than anything. Yes its nice and all but it doesn't do anything. Slanted to a fault (how could it not be) its Moore telling you something is wrong but not really offering any real solutions. (Hi- your house is on fire and your neighbors isn't, you point is what?) I can see why its dying at the box office, there is nothing you haven't seen before or nothing that hasn't been discussed on TV. Fahrenheit 911 at least made you think and laid out why we were in the crappy situation, Sicko is just "This is bad". Like his earlier Bowling for Columbine the film is very much a set up, especially in the second half where Moore's antics or at least his camera crew and presence result in some staged scenes-the whole Cuba thing. My reaction during most of it was "Yes and?" Forgive me but I really didn't like the film much. I don't need a rich film maker telling me "You're doomed" for two hours and then offering no real solutions other than universal health care- which he knows will be difficult to get by congress. What can I say but it would be nice to be able to clip off a check for 12 grand to send it to some one who hates me so they can pay their medical bills.<br /><br />Its a well made manipulative film, but other than inducing anger and depression it doesn't enlighten or point away anywhere, well it does- anywhere but the US- then again it doesn't show you the downside of not being here.<br /><br />Is it worth seeing? No, not really. I think you'll get more out of a discussion on a TV news program (so long as its not on FOX)
