Inept crew, cast, and plot, with awful effects, and a low low low budget.<br /><br />This folks, is a movie where the budget doesn't stretch to the hire of a police uniform. Yep - they make the poor mug wear a black bomber jacket and a black hat. Talking of the budget, surely it could have stretched to at least a visit to the butcher's shop for some offal rather than one sparingly used bottle of ketchup to cover all the gore requirements. <br /><br />I do have a few favourite moments in this film though...<br /><br />Who can forget the ridiculous girly fight at the beginning of the film? This was performed so slowly, that I initially thought it was their own low budget version of Matrix type slow-mo. But apparently not. What was that all about?<br /><br />I also loved it when, in the "police station" (cue outside shot of a police station, before cutting to someone's spare room), the FBI agent asks if there was a phone she could use. - in a police station!!?? <br /><br />But the award goes to the death by lawnmower scene - perhaps the least gruesome, most protracted and badly acted "horror movie kill" I've seen in a long time - you can plainly see no damage is done.<br /><br />and frankly I'm not going to comment on the ending, except to say that if those two actors were asked to "make out" in front of the camera, then I'm fairly certain they both have serious relationship problems in real life.<br /><br />There's loads more inept scenes like those - but if you like movie turkeys then I guess you'll like this one - 2/10 for the unintentional comedy.
