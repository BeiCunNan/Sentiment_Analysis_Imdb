Jay Baruchel is really been sort of a supporting guy in most of his movies like Tropic Thunder and Knocked Up. On the TV series Undeclared he was the main star, but as for the big screen he hasn't gotten a big break. I will admit that I didn't check this out because of Jay, but really instead because of Randy Quaid. Quaid was the only funny part of the recent Balls Out: Gary the Tennis Coach movie and he had me hysterically laughing throughout Kingpin. All in all he is a pretty funny guy. This movie actually appears in a less comedic way and actually appeals as a drama flick. Even though I found this movie to be a little off I still found it to be pretty interesting and not bad to watch just once. So if you need to kill some time then check this one out.<br /><br />7/10
