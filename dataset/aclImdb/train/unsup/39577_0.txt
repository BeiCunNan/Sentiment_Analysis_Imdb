This movie really hurt me. As in, it felt like my head was about to implode. I'm considering a class action suit against the director for the mental anguish and pain anyone who has seen this movie had to experience.<br /><br />Save yourself, don't see this movie. Maybe, if drunk, it would be a bit fun because it's so bad, but I really doubt it.<br /><br />Bad everything, bad story, bad acting, badly cast, bad music and bad ending. What more can you get? Bad credits music. Yes, they have terrible music there too.<br /><br />Oh and the women aren't even pretty.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor and rent Trolls2 instead, as it'll be a lot better. Or battlefield earth.<br /><br />1/10 (cant vote lower, sorry).
