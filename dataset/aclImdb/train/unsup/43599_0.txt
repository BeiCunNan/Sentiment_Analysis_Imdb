"A group of campers in the Canadian wilderness begins (sic) to hear strange reports over their radio. Tales of a plague spreading across the Earth, sightings of bizarre beings as well as planes and cars malfunctioning fills the airwaves. Terrified by what they've been listening to, the campers decide to barricade themselves at their cabin in order to face the danger," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />Aka "They", this is a very difficult movie to sit through. Hardly anything ever happens to the five main characters. They seem to be isolated in snowy Wisconsin, for reasons severely lacking in clarity, as the Earth is invaded from within. The "leader" finally emerges as "Stan" (Paul Bentzen); he is the blonde guy with the beard. "Sarah" (Debbi Pick) and "Jake" (Nick Holt) are brother and sister. "Eric" (Karl Wallace) seems to be the early "leader"; and, "Andy" (Robert Arkens) quintuples the group.<br /><br />The startling ending (a pair of loin-clothed young children are tastefully shown) would have worked; however, the preceding 90 minutes don't lead you there. The very derivative soundtrack jumps the shark when "Jake" goes for help in his snowmobile, to the tune of "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"!
