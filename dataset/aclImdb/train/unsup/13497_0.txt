Since I'm quite familiar with the Serbian nation and their people, I can just paid credit to the director for a perfect direction of a perfect movie that's based on a pure reality showing every detail without any exaggeration at all. I already watched the movie several times and I'd watch it over and over again without being bored even a minute. The movie itself shows how the life was in the ex-Yu (Belgrade) and I have to give credit to Pinki's father who in my opinion was the best actor alongside Kure, for brilliantly playing the role of a redundant officer, reflecting his huge disappointment towards the government for releasing him from his duties and for never being able to enjoy "his five minutes", despite committing himself 100% to the army in his entire life. I guess that was just one of so many disappointments shown during the movie and there are so many more things which unfortunately could not be shown in the movie, apart from the battles between the Serbian and croatian forces in the short sequence that was shown on TV. That was maybe one of the reasons that the people of Serbia hardly knew what was going around their country and what their government had been up to, while the queues for buying bread were miles long... as it's shown in the movie. Once again credit to the director, crew and especially the actors for performing at the highest level possible.
