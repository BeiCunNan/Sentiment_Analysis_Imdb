If one were to write a documentary about clichés, they could use this movie to supplement any single example of cliché that one could possibly think of.<br /><br />Lets begin by talking about the story line. The first-half, which dealt with a love story and father-son relations as dry as could be.

First of all, they seemed to just rush the love story, deciding that it wasn't really all that important, as Salman wouldn't even be in the second half of the movie.<br /><br />The comedy in the first half wasn't great either. Parts were OK, but the writers obviously thought they did a better job than they actually did.<br /><br />The second half of the movie proved to be one of the most predictable and boring scripts ever. Its as if the producer deciding to bring in script writers from TV soaps and wrap up the script. Furthermore, the theme was unbelievably outdated.<br /><br />Question>What do you get when you mix a bad storyline, with a bad director, bad writers, a horrible theme, and an extremely outdated moral message?
