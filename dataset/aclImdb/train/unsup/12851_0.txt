A film of some skin, lots of sex, few funny parts, and very little substance. Not compelling and uninteresting from the open to credits. I wish I could say this film had more to offer than making me feel like being able to go without sex for 90 days is some great feat, but there was nothing else that I got out of this movie. The characters don't ever connect with the audience, and the subject matter is overdone. This offers little new for the audience.
