Let me start by saying that in sitting down to watch this movie I knew exactly what I was in for. A science fiction flick similar to "War of the Worlds" or "Armageddon" that would run for approximately 2hrs. Well I was right, but "Knowing" did have a few small surprises as well. Now if you asked me, I would probably say "Knowing" was more like "The Ring" crossed with "Armageddon" - with a bit of an "Indiana Jones & The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" twist thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />"Knowing" isn't typical within the science-fiction/disaster genre because unlike every other film I've seen in recent years that has run with this formula it doesn't have any main characters that quite frankly you hope would die. That's not to say you'll miss any of those classic, "what are you thinking, idiot!" moments we're all so used to, because there are a few in here too, but unlike all those movies I just mentioned above; the focus doesn't seem to be on trying to make the characters as annoying as possible. You may want to argue that point but the next time I hear Dakota Fanning scream in Dolby Digital 5.1 I swear to god I will slit my wrists.<br /><br />If I had to comment on anything it would be that the SFX/CGI scenes seem a little unpolished. In 2009 the standard is you can watch a movie with CGI visuals that look so realistic that sometimes you get the urge to just rewind and watch what just happened simply because you cant believe your own eyes. Unfortunately with "Knowing", a film that relies on CGI heavily, that's not the case. You can pin-point every CG scene throughout the movie and to a point it can draw you away from what's going on, on screen. But I wouldn't say it's anything major, just slightly disappointing.<br /><br />Knowing is certainly a film I'd recommend to all science-fiction, disaster or post/pre-apocalyptic nuts (this last one would be me). I wouldn't go as far as to say that Knowing is going to be winning any awards any time soon, but the acting was solid (Nicolas Cage was as always fantastic to watch), the story was entertaining and the characters were likable. And that's all we can really ask for right? Check it out for yourself.
