I have always loved documentary films and studied film in university.When a friend of mine told that there was a documentary on beauty pageants that was going to be on television, I tuned in. The first thing that struck me about this particular documentary was that it didn't have a lot of the traditional interviews and there was no voice over - instead the filmmakers developed the story through the characters themselves, and what ensues is a unique approach to this form of film-making. It's great to see a documentary film that utilizes the camera to not only document, but to compose visually stunning shots as well. The editing really brought out the drama of the film and the music was really really good. It was great to see a fresh approach to this form of film-making. May there be more films like this.
