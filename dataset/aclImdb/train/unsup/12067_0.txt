My family loved this film. Not only was it breathtakingly beautiful but the dominant message - that the underdog can triumph against all odds and in the process of trying, learn more about him/herself than in all the preceeding years of his/her life makes this an outstanding film. The Maroc scenery was a visual treat. My father lived there in the early 60's and still waxes poetic about the landscape and wonderful people he met there.<br /><br />The negativity that a few have expressed about Hidalgo puzzles me and smacks of ulterior motives. I went to the theater expecting to see a "movie" with a positive message. I came out of the "movie" with so much more. But then, anyone who gives it an ounce of thought, can understand that the phrase "based on a true story" is not the same as "non-fiction". I would have stayed home and watched PBS for a documentary if that's what I expected.<br /><br />We are going to revisit Hidalgo and look forward to Mr. Fusco's next project.
