This is not only a dreadful movie, it is confusing, and has the feel of several movies stitched together sloppily. I watched it at 1.5 speed and still the pain did not end quickly enough. <br /><br />What was real? What was dream-state? I still don't know; worse, I don't care.<br /><br />I don't know and cannot imagine why Chow Yun-fat made this movie (he does not appear until more than 50 minutes into it) because he was successful already...he should have done commercials and sold floor wash or denture cleaners, done anything except this movie.<br /><br />If someone offers to give you this movie, decline politely.
