This movie is beyond bad. It is in that rarified nether-region where you can't really believe that what you are watching is really happening. I know, I know...it's just a movie, right? WRONG! The original Blues Brothers was an event, a symphony of chaos and destruction. This movie is a slap in the face to anyone who liked the original. You know you shouldn't make a sequel when most of your original cast looks like they have been embalmed. The original had John Lee Hooker, this piece of trash has Jonny Lang?! I'm sorry, but John Goodman, Joe Morton, and that little kid do not have a tenth of the talent that John Belushi and John Candy would have on their worst day. I can't believe Ackroyd lost all that weight for this (although he does look very good). Landis should have his film-makers license revoked. What's next...a sequel to Animal House?
