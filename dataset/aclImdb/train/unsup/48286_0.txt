A 3-D short with some annoying narrator going into a haunted house and meeting Frankenstein (twice), a witch, a skeleton, an archer, an Indian and assorted other "madmen".<br /><br />The movie is constantly throwing things at you for the effect--but it's pointless if u see it in 2-D (like I did).<br /><br />It is interesting to see they had 3-D technology back in 1941 but this short is just silly.<br /><br />And narrator Pete Smith is SO annoying. <br /><br />Worth a look just for its curiosity value. I really wish TCM could show this in 3-D but they can't. A 3.
