This video was terrible. The evidence presented was nothing more than circumstantial at best. No convincing evidence was presented and somehow the video comes to its conclusion a tad premature and lacking any semblance of evidence. This video is just another thing to create divisions in the religious community and into the whole We're right/You're wrong mindset. This movie demonstrates everything that's wrong with organized religion. The big groups attack the small groups with stuff like this when they should be working together, isn't that what their little scripture book tells them to? Horrible video! DO NOT WATCH THIS!
