First I must say that I am a big Paul Verhoeven fan and when I heard that he was directing Hollow Man with Kevin Bacon (who I am also a big fan of) I was really excited. I do not need to remind people of how terrible Hollow Man turned out to be. But this direct-to-video sequel, Hollow Man II, directed by Claudio Faeh and executive produced by Verhoeven, is actually really good. So good in fact that I am looking forward to the third installment of the franchise. The special effects, production value, performances and storyline are just as good if not better than most high-budget theatrical studio films. Christian Slater makes a great bad guy but what I enjoyed most was Peter Facinelli as the hero. Who knew -- Peter is a great action hero. This is by far the best direct-to-video horror/thriller film that I have seen in a long time. It makes me think that maybe Paul Verhoeven should hang up his hat as a director and oversee the sequels to his better films, Robocop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers. There is no argument that those franchises need as much help as they can get.
