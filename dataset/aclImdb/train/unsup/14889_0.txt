This movie is amazing. My roommates and I watch it at least once a week. Everyone should have to watch it. Apart from the lovely storyline of the main characters, there are so many great things to learn about the outside world around us. Facts of life that millions of people must live with everyday. This movie gives us a view into a world of NGO's and victims that few would ever know of and the more that know the more likely this world will begin to disappear. Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen turn in beautiful performances. The direction of the piece and the direction of photography was breathtaking. The absolute rawness makes it real, not movie-esquire which cheats so many movies of being taken seriously. This movie is a must see.
