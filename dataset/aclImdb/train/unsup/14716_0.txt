My categorized comment about the whole movie is like this<br /><br />Acting : 3.0/4 Direction : 0.5/1 Screenplay : 0.7/1 Cinematography : 0.9/1 Sound : 0.8/1 Music, Dance n Song : 2.0/2<br /><br />in all 7.9/10<br /><br />All in all it is a very good musical movie, actually its songs are very good and also the choreography is exceptionally good. Salim, Sulaiman should be given the credit for the wonderful music. Also, one particular thing about the movie is its song is shown in parts that gives a kinda different touch to the movie.<br /><br />At last the play portrayed at the end of the movie is wisely knitted. Must watch for a music lover, for choreography and ya for Madhuri fans.
