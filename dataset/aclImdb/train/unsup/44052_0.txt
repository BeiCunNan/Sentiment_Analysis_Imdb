coming from a huge horror fan, i normally have an open mind watching new horror films but i had to rate this film a 1, when it really deserves a -86. this not only was one of the complete worst movies i have ever seen, it is a complete disgrace to horror movies in general. i do not know how this crap even got made. i am not sure what year it was to take place in, but at no time did police cars look like 86' buicks spray painted black. second of all, i thought this was a slasher, since when do slashers not have any blood/gore? that is the point of a slaher film last time i checked. i am still not sure about the "killer" in this movie, OK i get he was an escaped mental patient that looked like an idiot, but was he also a super hero? he sure seemed to throw like one. i could go on forever about this movie, from its awful direction and cinematography to its lighting and its score, not to mention the films amazing acting. why don't these people have an Oscar yet? these people definitely did not even pass drama class in high school.<br /><br />overall, this is the worst movie i have ever seen and a complete disgrace to horror films, if your going to make a horror film, do it right. i do not recommend this to any person on the planet to watch this piece of filth. Boon Collins, is a disgrace to all horror directors.
