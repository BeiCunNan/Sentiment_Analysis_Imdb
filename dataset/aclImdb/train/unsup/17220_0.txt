Disappointing "Salon Kitty" wannabe WW2 WIP flick. This is Nazi exploitation at its most mediocre. The production values are higher than some of its co-genre (viz Love Camp and SS Camp), but it fails to deliver in most other areas.<br /><br />If you like full frontal nudity, you wont find much. If you are into jackboot torture, again it is not going to deliver for you. If you really want to see "wimmin who shag in ze name of exposing traitors to ze Fatherland", then you have come to the right shop (again). How many times have we seen this old yarn re-worked and churned out?<br /><br />Fraid it doesn't work for me any more. Watch the original if you are into this cinematic style...
