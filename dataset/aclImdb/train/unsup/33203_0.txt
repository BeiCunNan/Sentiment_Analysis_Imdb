This movie really deserves a 0 vote because it was so cheap. the title had nothing to do with the movie and had nothing to do with the plot.<br /><br />This movie was not even close to being a horror because I could not stop laughing about the horrible acting. I can't believe Blockbuster would put such crap on their shelves.<br /><br />It was peculiar how the school at the beginning only had four students in the hallways. Maybe it is because this movie had a low budget. But please do not waste money on this movie. It makes for a good comedy but not a horror. Overall the plot just a mess and did not make any sense...
