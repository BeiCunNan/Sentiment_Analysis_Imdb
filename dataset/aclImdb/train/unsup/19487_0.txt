The nearest British television got to a 'Fonzie'-type character was 'Wolfie Smith' who, in his 'Freedom For Tooting!' T-shirt, khaki jacket, braces, jeans and green beret, was an ineffectual rebel somehow left over from the '60's. He was marvellously played by the charismatic Robert Lindsay, in his first television role since 'Get Some In!'. Wolfie worshipped Che Guevara, and dreamt of 'the glorious day' when the downtrodden working classes rose up as one and threw off the shackles imposed on them by their capitalist masters. Ah. If only...<br /><br />Backing him up were Buddhist Ken, sad cowboy Tucker, and psychotic Speed. Luckily, Wolfie had a most understanding girlfriend in the shape of Shirley. Unluckily, her Dad - a Tory voting security guard - didn't see Wolfie's appeal, constantly disparaging him as 'that long-haired Yeti in plimsolls!". It was all very funny, hardly surprising seeing as it was penned by the great John Sullivan ( his first series ). One of the best episodes was when the T.P.F. kidnapped a man they thought to be their local M.P., only to discover that he was the local 'Godfather' - Harry Fenning.<br /><br />Cheryl Hall left after the second series, so Shirley was written out. Peter Vaughan ( who played her Dad ) left also, and the role went to Tony Steedman. Er, why? With Shirley gone, there was no need for her Dad to be still around. Or for Wolfie to be still living in the Johnson's house that matter.<br /><br />Arguably the most famous episode was the final one of Season Three, in which the T.F.B. found an abandoned tank, and tried to take over the reins of power by storming Parliament. After a short prison sentence, they came back for one final series, which concluded with Wolfie and Ken going to Spain to find Shirley, only to discover that she was now happily married. 'Citizen Smith' had a good run, and is fondly remembered. Lindsay may have done other things since, but to me he'll always be 'Wolfie'. Sullivan's next series was 'Only Fools & Horses'. Ever heard of it?<br /><br />Remember, folks - Power To The People!
