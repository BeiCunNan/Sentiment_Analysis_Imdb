Look I don't wanna say much about this movie..... Its great,Bachchan is superb....But it is a complete ripoff of Brian De Palma's Scarface....Just check out both and then tell me of there's difference.. A group of bandits are in a village.They kill Bachchcan's father and almost rape his mother. Swearin revenge he starts assassinating the bandits which his mother disapproves. Meanwhile he begins a relationship with a nurse and his sister with Bachchan's bodyguard... I know it doesn't sound same but first see Scarface and tell me if there is a difference.. But its a great movie and Bachchan's performance is awesome.
