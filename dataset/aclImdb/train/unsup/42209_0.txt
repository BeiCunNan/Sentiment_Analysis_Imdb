I had heard that this movie was bad, but I foolishly thought "well, it has Jet Li and Chingmy Yau, how bad can it be?". Answer: so bad that it makes you want to turn it off after only the first 5 minutes. Jet Li's fighting - everyone's fighting, actually - is ridiculously overdone and overedited; Yau's charming presence and smile is the only thing this awful, unwatchable movie has going for it. The plot doesn't make a lick of sense (as even those who liked the film have admitted) and the dubbing (of the "Evil Cult" version) is incomprehensible.<br /><br />0 out of 4 stars.
