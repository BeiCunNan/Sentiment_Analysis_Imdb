Okay I realized this movie was not made for me... I am not a woman nor a latino but for creators sake at least the writers could have done was create 3-dimensional characters.<br /><br />All the dialog was overshadowed by Spanish music. Seems like they were trying to sell the latest in Latin music than sell the characters. But on the other hand I could see the reason why...<br /><br />The acting was Gawd horrible...I watched this movie high on caffeine but for some reason found it extremely difficult to stay awake.<br /><br />I didn't even know this movie actually went to the theaters. It should have been left on the cutting room floor... all 8,100 feet! My belief was that some studio exec got a hard-on seeing the leading latinas in the same movie and decided to cough up some dough.<br /><br />I used this film as production research to see what the production did with 5 million dollars and its obvious it was totally wasted! Do yourself a favor rent this movie and keep the DVD... It makes for a nice drink coaster.
