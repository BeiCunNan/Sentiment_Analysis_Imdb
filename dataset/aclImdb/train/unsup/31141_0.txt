This is the best looking $4500 film I have ever seen. Not that I have ever seen a film with that budget.<br /><br />Great performance by Matt nelson, great cinematography and cool editing. Very happy to hear that Warner's/ Polychrome picked it up.<br /><br />Your average slasher film begins with a body count, this one actually has the balls to have some kind of character development. We truly feel for the lead character and understand why he ends up doing what he does.<br /><br />I still cannot believe how Jose Cassella captured the images he did on such a low/ nothing budget.<br /><br />If you go in thinking this is Schindler's List, then you will not get this. This is a gem designed for late 70's horror fans, a must see.<br /><br />great job. great flick.
