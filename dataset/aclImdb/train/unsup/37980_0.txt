This movie had its moments. It had a pretty cool seans (spelling correct?) scene where they summon some indian spirit. It was quite a pleasure to hear Lalo Schifrin's music. It had few moments that really made me jump and few moments where I was really involved in watching the film. Tony Curtis was OK, not very good though. One thing that I learned is that everything has a "manitou", even man-made objects. Overall this movie was just average for me. I gave it a 4 out of 10. Plot was interesting, acting was mediocre (except the guy who played the indian who helpes Curtis was great), Music was pretty good, make-up was good. It had some cheesie sfx.
