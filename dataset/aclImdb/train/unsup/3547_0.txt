I have seen the movie more than 10 years ago and I haven't forgotten it due to the strong impact it left me. The "superhuman" traits of the main female character has struck me to the very core of my being, not being able to fully comprehend how she has survived all the odds she has faced. It has inspired me personally on my quest to find my true happiness and I am very happy to say that I have. I really am thankful and blessed to have seen the movie. <br /><br />I recommend it as a movie that will change one's life for the better forever.It will also help you get to know yourself well as you will question one's humanity and understanding of enduring suffering for the sake of love and one's dignity.<br /><br />From the movie, these words of wisdom have never been so true: If there's a will, there's a way and no pain, no gain, among others.
