Cross-pollination of "Stand and Deliver" with "Dirty Dancing" is jaw-droppingly misguided. Beverly Hills math teacher, who struts his stuff at night in a barrio club, gets involved with under-privileged kids and gives them lessons on how to Lambada--a hot new Latin dance! Moronic junk is almost endearingly bad...almost. It features uncharismatic leads, soapy melodrama, generic club music, and teeth-gnashing dialogue. It does attempt an offbeat approach to a formula plot, but that is the only positive thing one can really say about it. <br /><br />* from ****
