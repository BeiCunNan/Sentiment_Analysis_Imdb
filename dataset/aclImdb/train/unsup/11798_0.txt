I really enjoyed this movie, it was very funny, sexy and the two leads (David Wenham and Susie Porter) were fantastic. I never for one second lost interest in this movie, there's always something going on, usually something funny. The supporting cast were good, especially Kris McQuade the taxi driver. The direction and script were really good, the music is very enjoyable, especially the music for the bath scene. Overall I think this is a great movie, and should be seen by all. 10/10 from me.
