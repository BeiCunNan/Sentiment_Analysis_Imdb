I'm very disappointed about this film, I actually expected something from Gael Garc√≠a, but I can say that without question is the worst film I ever watched: - There is no plot at all - The characters are very weak - The direction is awful, even Gael as an actor performs very bad - Edition & Cinematography are below an acceptable film - The difference between social classes in the film is not clear and it doesn't exist at all, in Mexico we can consider all the characters in the film from the same social class (only different life-style)<br /><br />After watching it, you'll get the feeling that you were watching a home video of one of your so-so parties, because even most real-world parties are a lot more fun and interesting than this film.<br /><br />Hopefully Gael will perform better in his next work.
