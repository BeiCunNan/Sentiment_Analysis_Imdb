I was really looking forward to watch this when it aired during Christmas 2005. I am not a fan of Charles and Camilla at all, but for some reason I have always found the Royals a fascinating family to follow. Their lives seems to be like one long running soap opera and of course when it comes to scandals this one takes the biscuit.This program was meant to make the public symphasise with Camilla, but instead really shows her up. In the film she has the portrayal of a very rich but cheap tart who seemed to constantly lead Charles along and then let him down. When they first meet they both know that they have something special, but before long when Charles is off in the navy she gets engaged with hardly any thought. Next she gets pregnant, but they still can't stay away from each other. There are bits when Camilla seems to feel sad and cry, but that dosen't match her actions. They both agree that he needs to marry someone. Camilla personally takes on the job to find a young, sweet, naive virgin while she and Charles can see each other without her suspecting much. There is a horrible over whelming sense of betrayal and the thought that they are going to ruin someones life forever, especially Camilla finds a house for him and Diana to live in - that is 20 minutes away from her. Also in the scene where Camilla tells Diana not to hunt, so she can be alone with him is very calculating. You want Diana to run away when she confronts him about her fears of his adultery before the wedding, but you know she isn't going to. At the end Camilla and Charles are tearful that he is going to be married, but this still dosen't make them nicer people to feel sorry for, because of what they are doing. It was a very watchable and thrilling programme, you forget that you know exactly what is going to happen.
