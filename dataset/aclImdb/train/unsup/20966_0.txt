What can I say about this film other than superb. I was in tears at the end of the film and had a lump in my throat at several other occasions. It truly dues make you think about your own life, the futility of war and humanity.<br /><br />The scenes of suffering, hardship and brutality are equally mixed with mercy, forgiveness, kindness and hope.<br /><br />With fantastic acting, and a moving soundtrack I cannot reccomend this film highly enough.<br /><br />Watch, learn, enjoy and be sure to tell someone else about this wonderful film.
