I figured this would be a lot like She's all that and i was right. Instead of having the title Boys and Girls it should have been He's all that! Ryan grew up planning his whole life perfectly even though he was a geek through out high school, dated a fellow geek played by Alyson Hannigan and yet for some strange reason the most popular girl in his school Jennifer always seemed to be around him all the time. Even so they end up going to the same uni and that's where they become friends, but as Jennifer can pick any guy she still continues not to be satisfied and where Ryan was concerned he seemed like the perfect guy she could talk to since he wasn't interested in getting involved with anyone there were no problems between them. Their friends believe they are somewhat in love with each other and soon things get out of hand causing their perfect friendship to be in trouble since both are not after the same thing... It's a typical boy meets girl, girl meets boy, they hate each other but under the circumstances they find a reason to be friends and so on. I think Freddie is great looking guy so for his fans yes this is a good watch, but if there is another movie on the shelf that you would also like to see, get that one first this can wait. Out of 10 I would give this a 3 only because Freddie looks so cute in a goatee!
