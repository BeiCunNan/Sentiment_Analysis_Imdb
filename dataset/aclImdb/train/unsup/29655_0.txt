Bernie Mac and Judith Scott appeared to be a bit too young to be the parents of girls in their mid-20's, yet the premise is all too real in the USA and in the Caribbean...<br /><br />Many black families have a problem with racial jokes yet object to their children being "colour-blind," and marrying outside The Race, but this is a problem swiftly solved by both intendeds letting everyone in their respective families know that they're marrying each other and not the family! Back to the picture, Bernie was funny as the NASCAR loving loans officer and Ashton Kutcher was good as the well-meaning devoted and sappy fianc√©.<br /><br />However, the problems started from the time that Theresa/Zoe Saldana left out that Simon/Kutcher was caucasian...<br /><br />Some of the stereotyping in the picture is probably parodied as it needs to be made like a dinosaur, extinct and fast - having an anniversary celebration that only one side wants and doing what YOU would like and not really have the other person in mind; the Metrosexual male (I was shocked to see Dante, the Wedding Designer was married, must've been for convenience); black women gathering in a drunken hive to bitch over a man who's done one of them wrong and not answering your mobile for pride's sake... Pride don't keep you warm at night, sugar! Grow up and tell your Mommy too! The hilarious parts involved Bernie getting his pants adjusted, Ashton teaching Bernie how to dance, the Go-Kart race and Ashton's accurate prediction of the rain and Bernie's refusing to use the windshield wipers - His character was best summed up at the hotel, when it was learned he rerserved a room from the time he knew his wife gave birth to baby girls! Yet in the end, when Bernie got what he originally wanted, he discovered it was no longer so as he learned how much Simon/Kutcher really loved his daughter and that Simon indeed had principles even if he didn't play sports...<br /><br />Opposites attract, plain and simple - Simon is businessman and Theresa is an artist... They have what the other longs to be! Same as the speech that Bernie stole from Ashton to woo back his wife on the day before their 25th Wedding Anniversary.<br /><br />In the end, for this culture - at any rate, fathers just have to realise they can't marry their daughters (except for Woody Allen) and just grit and bear the fact they will never accept whoever their daughter marries even if the prospective son-in-law develops the cure for AIDS! Better to dislike him and have grandkids with blond dreadlocks and light eyes than not knowing where your daughter is as she eloped and left the country or moved town to avoid seeing or hearing you...
