Well what can I say. Someone played a prank on me. I am a known action flick buff and someone suggested I go watch the movie on the big screen. I did accordingly and soon realized that it was a joke played on me. I could not even sit through the entire movie and walked away after an hour or so feeling completely wasted. However I promised myself that I will wreak vengeance onto my tormentor. If someone knows a worse movie than this please let me know so that I can fulfill my revenge.<br /><br />About the movie the less said the better. Hence I will not waste any more time on this and finally would like to warn all about this sickening movie.
