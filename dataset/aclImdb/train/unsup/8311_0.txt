When Trevor Blackburn awoke from a coma,he had no memory of his past.In search for answers,he breaks into the secret attic with another patient,as the others are being killed one by one.A darkly sinister doctor played by a horror regular Jeffrey Combs informed him that he'd been committed to a sanitarium for the criminally insane for the sacrificial murder of his fianc√©e.Thrown into a bizarre halfway house filled with strange psychos he plunges into a violent world of magic,nightmares,wild sexual escapades and torturous medical experiments.The above synopsis on the back of my tape sounded pretty good,so I finally decided to check this film out."The Attic Expeditions" is a pretty unusual horror flick.It contains a decent amount of violence and nudity.The plot is interesting as it showcases plenty of unique twists and turns,but in the end becomes extremely confusing.8 out of 10.
