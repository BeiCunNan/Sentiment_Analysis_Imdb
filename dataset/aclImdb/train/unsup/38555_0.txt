Review contains SPOILERS !!!<br /><br />Well, first of all, the videostore ripped me off on this one. I rented a cool looking movie called Pumpkinhead and Lance Henriksen stood on the cover. I had read some praising reviews on it so I took it with me. When I put it in the VCR, the first thing it said was : PUMPKINHEAD 2: BLOOD WINGS. Hmmmm...not correct. Normally, I never watch sequels before I saw the originals but since I had already paid for it I continued watching. From what I've learned in the sequel, the myth behind this little fella called Pumpkinhead is pretty cool. Even the intro of this film makes you suspect you're about to see a great horror story. ( A good old-fashioned black and white sequence shows how a horrible deformed boy get killed by angry young men ). Impressive demon as well, I've sure seen worse. But unfortunately...that about does it for the positive elements on Blood Wings.<br /><br />I was glad to see Andrew Robinson again ! This guy became immortal in my eyes since he played the leading character in my all time favorite movie Hellraiser. Too bad this is actually the only one on his list worth mentioning. His daughter in this movie is played by Ami Dolenz. She's a very attractive girl but that doesn't mean she can act, I'm afraid. The whole group of "tough" teenagers remind of Beavis and Butt-head to be honest.<br /><br />"Hey Beavis, you wanna go raise a demon ?"<br /><br />" huh, huh...yeah Cool...euh...why, Butt-head?"<br /><br />"euh...huh huh...euh...I dunno! "<br /><br />" huh huh...yeah cool...let's raise a demon ! "<br /><br />Well, maybe a bit exaggerated but it's pretty much the idea behind it. A group of modern teenagers raise a demon and they go away. The hideous creature is loose and starts a killing spree. Not random victims, though. There seems to a connection between the murdered people. It's up to the new sheriff to find out what that is. The viewer know it after about 5 minutes but Andrew ( the Sheriff ) needs a whole 85 minutes for it.<br /><br />Pure talking horror, I also have a positive note concerning this film. I've already said the demon looks impressive and above that, it knows how to kill, indeed. If you like your horror gory, you'll appreciate several scenes of Pumpkinhead 2. He has a cool walk and vision as well. In fact, I have the same vision-style when I'm drunk...
