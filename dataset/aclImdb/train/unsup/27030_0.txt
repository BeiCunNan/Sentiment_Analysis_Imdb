How do I get those two hours back?? The writer couldn't get anyone to make it for him, so he made it himself! He should have listened to the experts. The worst is watching the directors commentary and hearing how dead serious the guy is. He truly believes his story and the movie he has made are great. Pathetic!! <br /><br />There is simply not enough to this movie to warrant writing ten lines of text about it, it was the worst movie I have ever seen and if you've got nothing better to do than watch it, I recommend watching grass grow or cutting your toenails! Anything would be better than sitting through this waste of resources
