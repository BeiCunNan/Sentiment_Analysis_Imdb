There are some people that only sees sh*t in the Mexican movies nowadays instead o supporting, I mean I don't really think the people of Sundance don't know anything about movies! The acting is good, the screenplay is hilarious, the fx are quite good, the characters are funny I especially love the "Santo" spoof), the best in show is Joaquin Cosio ("Mascarita"), of course its not the best of the movies but its entertaining and that is something everybody likes right?<br /><br />If there's one thing i have to say bad in this movie is that Ana Claudia Talancon was wasted in the movie<br /><br />So to all the people stop discriminating your own product and enjoy this movie because its entertaining!
