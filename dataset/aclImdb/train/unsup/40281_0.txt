Terrible acting, terrible plot, terrible dialogue, terrible soundtrack, terrible dubbing, and a terrible waste of time. It wasn't offensive, just completely and utterly boring. I'm a BIG fan of lots of low budget or B grade movies, but usually they have a great plot or a good idea behind them. I watched this with a friend who loves B grade horror movies and he actually fell asleep through it. This is something maybe a 5 year old kid would find amusing, but you'd have to find one of those kids who giggles every time somebody says the word 'butt'. He wouldn't be laughing at the movie, just the word 'butt'. To give you an idea of how juvenile this movie is, they use the word 'poop' a lot but never say the S word (that would be rude wouldn't it?) however they occasionally use the F word. It felt like a Disney movie, designed not to offend anybody. It doesn't fit into the 'Comedy' genre and doesn't fit into the 'horror' genre either. The most amusing thing about the movie is the name. I can only assume the movie is so far rating at 7.3/10 after 30 votes is because every single member of the cast voted 10 for it. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS!! I implore you! Stop giving people who make these movies your DVD renting money! Then maybe they will stop making movies like this. I've seen movies in the IMDb Bottom 100 that were far more entertaining than this.
