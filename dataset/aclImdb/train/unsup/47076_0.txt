I was on an overnight pass from the Army in 1969 when this movie was playing. My buddies and I thought it might be a good movie. We were starved for entertainment. This movie was so disappointing. It was too heavy for us, We were about to leave for Vietnam and wanted to see something light. Maybe I was too young or it was the events of my life at the time. But we all thought it was bad. I have remembered this movie all my life, as it was the last one I saw in the US. I do admit the the cast was good, that was why we chose that one. I have always liked Kirk. But in the end we found it depressing. I would watch it again if it ever came on TV, Just so that I could make another judgment after all these years.
