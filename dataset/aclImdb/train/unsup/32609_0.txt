Prime is the worst movie I've seen in the last year. When I first heard of this movie I couldn't wait to rent it because the previews made it sound hilarious. I was enjoying it for the first 20 minutes, and then I was put to sleep. This is a comedy, and I didn't laugh a single time. I was also put off by all of the flat religious jokes. The last 30 minutes is a jumbled up mess. It's like it didn't know how to end so it just kept going, and going, and going. If I had the choice of either digging a ditch, or watching prime I'd dig a ditch. The lead actor is very stale. At times you want to strangle him because he's so bad of an actor. I read a previous reviewer state this felt like a Woody Allen movie. I agree, and it's the worst I've seen.
