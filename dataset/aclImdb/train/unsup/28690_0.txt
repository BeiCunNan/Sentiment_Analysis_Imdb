My main quarrel with romance movies is that they are targeted for a specific audience (females 18-30) and from working in a video store that is the demographic who rents them. This movie I could watch with just about anyone, as it is a perfect balance of comedy, good drama, and romance, with great acting by everyone, and good directing as well. Call it a chick flick if you want, but it does not disappoint, 'Excuse me there are JEWS at my table' hahahahaha (by the way im jewish)
