Complete horror failures such as "Fear Dot Com" and "My Little Eye" apparently haven't made it fully clear just yet: the internet is NOT scary!! And yet in this eighth sequel, Rick Bota; also known as the dude who doesn't allow the Hellraiser franchise to die peacefully; presents Hellraiser now as a popular internet game that has nerdy followers and organizes secret parties in isolated mansions. Two years after the tragic suicide of their friend Adam, a group of heavily addicted Hellworld players receive invitations to an exclusive party for Pinhead fans only. The macabre host (played by Lance Henriksen) turns out to be the biggest freak of all and his collection of dangerous toys and Lamant boxes is more than impressive. During the party, however, the game becomes reality and Pinhead & his Cenobites occasionally come around to kill the teenagers. Admittedly, "Hellworld" is slightly  with the emphasis on the word 'slightly'  better than the previous two installments directed by Rick Bota. The reason is simply that "Hellseeker" and "Deader" tried to be complex psychological horror films whereas this "Hellworld" is less ambitious and goes straight for some old-fashioned morbid butchering. The murders are quite gory and there some really morbid set-pieces to enjoy, such as a gigantic meat-hook and a nice collection of bottled monsters. Still, you don't care one iota whether the characters live or die and there never is any real suspense in the script. The once legendary Pinhead is barely present and he's pretty much used like a typical pop-up advertisement: pointless, promising but bleak and gone before you know it. Decent ending, though!
