It's hard to get the full effect of how powerful this play is while sitting in one's living room. Death ... is an amazing story that really hits you in the theatre but loses its punch on the smaller screen. The performances are good, and the play speaks for itself however, Ms. Franz is the added bonus of seeing this version.
