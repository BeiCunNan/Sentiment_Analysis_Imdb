After a war on a far off Island is won women are recruited to come be with the soldiers and help set up a new colony. Of course things don't go right. Based on a play by Jeff Noon, best known for the Vurt novels, this is a mediocre film based on a mediocre play. I'm a huge fan of Jeff Noon's writing but I really don't like the play since it feels much too obvious for what it is. You can feel the film's heart on its sleeve as it criticizes the Falkland's war, the military and male female relationships in a macho environment . It's all much too obvious. I would take a pass if you come across it unless your a fan of the cast which includes Guy Pearce, Ray Winstone and Emily Lloyd.
