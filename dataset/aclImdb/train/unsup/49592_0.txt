Where on earth did Kevin Sorbo come from? He's better in Andromeda, but not much. Why, why would anyone cast him in any heroic role? He's nasally, dull and has a Midwestern accent absolutely identical in everything he does. And that can NOT be his real body - which would at least explain why he can't act. He's at Gold's gym night and day. Tia Carrere, however, is so beautiful, and so understated as the seductress - really, it's almost worth the agony just to see her in her pale blue gown. Anyhow, for god's sake don't rent this. I'm just stuck with it on the Sci-fi channel. Battlestar Galactica, here I come! I'm not even sure I can get 10 lines out talking about this. Have I made it yet?
