Until it was derailed by a rather disappointing ending, this was perhaps the cutest movie that I had ever seen. They are simply not capable of making this kind of film in the States...it has far too leisurely a pace to be even considered a worthwhile project in the U.S. It is just so gentle and laid-back that it won me over almost immediately, and even with the weak finish, it's still one of the finest British comedies that I have ever seen.
