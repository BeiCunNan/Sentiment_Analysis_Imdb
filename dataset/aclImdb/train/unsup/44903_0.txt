I give it two stars for frontal nudity and the rest is garbage the movie stinks so bad I had to fast forward to bear it...as a gay man I always hope for a fine well done movie and unfortunately this just wasn't any of those things. Convoluted, stupid, boring, utterly a waste of time. Montgomery I have seen him in other films he just can't act, the other actor was decent but the movie just isn't any good terrible direction, awful script just skip it, there are better gay films out there to bad most of them are foreign made or else come from a non gay filmmaker. I guess it was a big stretch to try and make a meaningful movie and have it be sci-fi horror.
