Okay, i'm a guy so i had to like all the toplessness in the first Room, the second room was quite annoying, 3rd room was humorous, gotta love the children, the little boy is from desperado. cute kids. The 4th room, well, its tarantino so its a 10. The only reason i got this movie was for Robert Rodrigous and Tarantino. Wasnt worth the 14 dollars though. I think Tim Roths character got annoying after the first 10 mins, obviously tarentino or rodrigous didnt pick the music for they're rooms, all in all, Dont waste your money, but if your a True Tarantino fan you must get it.
