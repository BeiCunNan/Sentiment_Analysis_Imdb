A killer is dispatching the patrons of the local drive-in with a sword.Heads are sliced off,necks are slashed and other various body parts are impaled.Two inept detectives are trying to solve the case."Drive-In Massacre" is an abysmal slasher flick directed by porn director Stu Segall.There are some bloody killings,but the gore effects are crude and amateurish.The pace is slow,the acting is painfully bad and the synthesizer score is beyond awful.Easily the best thing about this insanely rotten piece of festering cow-dung is its short running time.The only way to enjoy "Drive-In Massacre" is to drink lots of alcohol.3 out of 10 for providing me a few laughs.
