this movie was...horrible. just painful to watch, i'm amazed that i actually sat through the whole thing without clawing my eyes out. I'm all for silliness and aliens and kung fu, but...this just didn't work, it was a halfbaked plot that was horribly acted and just sad...really sad, i don't even want to imagine the pitch this movie had. how any studio or anyone could actually consider this script is just...beyond me. I fear many brain cells have been killed watching this movie, the humor is too narrow, it would only appeal to a certain sort of people and thankfully that type of person is few and far between. The jokes got old and the plot was contrived the acting mediocre, and my god half of the movie wasn't even imperitive, just a lot of filler time. but the last scene with the ninja was amusing...till they started talking again.
