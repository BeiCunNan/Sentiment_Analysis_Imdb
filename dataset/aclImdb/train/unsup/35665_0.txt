I'm getting frustrated that so many people are complaining that this show is propaganda for the Christian religion. I watched the first few episodes of this miniseries and I can tell you that it's not religious at all, except for the quotes of the bible. All things that happen are just over the top and not believable at all. If they used the real story of revelation for the show, it would have been so much better. This show feels like another Dan Brown book. It doesn't help religion at all and just makes Christians look like fools. And to all people who think that Christians are just making propaganda, you should just watch TV once and see how much crap Christians have to watch because of you. Temptation island is just one small example. If you don't like Christian shows, then do not watch them. I don't watch yours! The only shows I like are Lost and 24, even though they aren't Christian. <br /><br />Anyway, not only is this series not accurate to the bible AT ALL, but it is also pretty boring to watch. I'm still waiting for some good movie or show about the revelation. Time will tell...
