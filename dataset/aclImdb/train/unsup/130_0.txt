This is one of the movies where you get into a state. State of mind, I'll never forget the first time I saw this movie. What feeling,<br /><br />I think that Nikita make the movie so free that you almost believe this is happening "Live". French movie, Luc Beson this is quality.<br /><br />Shes close to be a soldier who fights for integrity and for the human freedom while she claime up the stairs to respect and acknowledgement.<br /><br />I don't know if it would be good with a second movie. Time have passed and it's twelve years ago, so how does she look like today comparred to 1990. Nevermind this is one of the top 10 movies at all times.<br /><br />Be aware - Be prepaired - for a meeting with true actress - improvised - and timeless, a cult and one of it's kind.<br /><br />Thanks for the warm a delightfull experience.
