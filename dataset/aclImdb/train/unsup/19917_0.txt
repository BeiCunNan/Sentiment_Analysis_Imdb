"Skinheads" is a movie about good 'ole boys, who were never meaning no harm. Beats all you ever saw, they've been in trouble with the law since the day they was born. Straightening the racial curves, flattening the social hills, someday the mountain might get 'em but the law never will. They're just making their way, the only way they know how. But that's just a little bit more than the law will allow. Just the good 'ole boys, wouldn't change if they could. Fighting minorities like true modern day...Hitlers.<br /><br />I very highly recommend this movie, because it sheds light upon a type of life that many cant see. It's a life full of burning crosses and the worship a long-dead political leader. I - of course - speak of the life of men with side burns. Jason Preistly depicted the side-burned male as a handsome, desirable person. but this movie shows these animals for what they are; hateful, flag-burning racists.
