Like many people I believed this to be funny because the title was Naked Space. <br /><br />I am not sure, but I believe the title was invented after the success of the great naked gun movies that were made years after this horrible crap.<br /><br />This is truly one meaningless movie. <br /><br />No matter how much you try to laugh at the jokes, you can't because actually there are none. It is almost if they tried to make the most boring movie ever and succeeded.<br /><br />I smiled once during this movie.
