I found watching this film to be a dark,depressing experience. Not because of the hideous script, crass emotionally inconsistent acting (including Mr Pacino -Sorry Al!), banal-but-predictable plot (complete with by-the-numbers set pieces - someone had a checklist) or even because of the painfully inept direction but because it reminds you that there is a part of the film industry out there prepared to make and release terrible films such as this for a quick buck and willing to pull down A-list(ish) talent to it's grim level in the process. 5 minutes into this film you realise you've wasted your $5 rental fee and you feel the life being sucked out of you. Then you start to wonder how do films like this get made? Did they intend to make a turkey? And if not, why didn't someone (e.g. Script-writer, Director, Soundman, Mobile Caterer etc) at some stage stop and say "Hey guys, this thing we're doin' here is absolutely pant-wettingly, teeth-gnashingly, DVD-snappingly damn awful"? I would respectfully suggest the cast and crew of 88 Minutes find something better to do with the rest of their lives than be involved with films such as this. I shall attempt to do the same............
