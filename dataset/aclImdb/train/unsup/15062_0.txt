There is a reason this movie was shelved for, how long? 7 years? This should be the first hint.<br /><br />At any rate, I watched this movie with an open mind. I wanted to like it, and enjoy myself, but there just was not much to it. An Idiot reporter runs around p***ing off the locals and Sandra Bullock meets up with him. I guess there is some environmental activist named santos that meets and unfortunate end, and they are sort of involved. The plot of this movie is so really hard to follow. Maybe because there really is not much of a plot at all. The last 15min are sort of exciting, only because you know it's almost over so you can do something else.<br /><br />Yes, Sandra has a love scene. No it's exciting enough to watch this movie.<br /><br />Ever watched a movie that made you keep looking at the VCR to see how long you had been watching it? That is This Movie!<br /><br />Movie gets a nice big 2 out of 10 from me.
