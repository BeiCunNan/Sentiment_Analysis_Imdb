I thought this film was very cleverly put together and had a nice feel and pace. The storyline, built around the New Years holiday, adds the right feel for the film. I felt it was a unique love story with just the right touch of humor and it gets better every time I see it. I liked the fact that the players were "normal" Black folk (ok there are a few rappers). Overall its just nice to see a film by Blacks where the focus is not on being Black, but just being human and telling a story.
