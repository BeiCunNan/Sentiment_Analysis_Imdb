I highly recommend everyone see it at least once. Probably the best performance of James Brolin & Jill Clayburgh EVER. They have a great on screen chemistry. I have loved this movie since the first day I saw it, at the drive-in theater. I looked for it on VHS, long ago, and was unable to find it, so I taped the censored version from TV. Now that it is on VHS...I can't find it on DVD. This is one of the few DVD's that I would be willing to pay "FULL PRICE".
