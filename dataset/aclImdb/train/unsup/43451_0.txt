This is without a doubt between the worst films ever ever ever made in history of cinema, this director must be the new Ed Wood. Not even that, because at least he was so bad that he was good. This is so bad that you feel pity. Not for him, for your brain. Please mister Dyonisius be a Dentist or an accountant or whatever else. There is no plot there is no, acting, there is no nothing! I really have nothing else to say about it but apparently i have to keep writing. Just don't watch it seriously, your brain will feel offended by it, use this time to clean your drawers, organize alphabetically your DVD collection, sort your towels by colors, seriously ANYTHING would be better that watching this awful piece of... images.
