This had to be the best of any Inuyasha movie released in English thus far. Even if you haven't been a geek sworn in to the series, you'll understand the basic storyline, very much unlike the previous two.<br /><br />This is not for the lovebirds in the audience, it's more for the series' main genre, the action (battle of the brothers to be precise). The movie's OC villain, Takemaru, was surprisingly deep and had an exceptional storyline laced with Izayoi, Inuyasha's mother. The father of Inuyasha and Sesshomaru, however, was probably the highlight of this feature, he himself was worth seeing the entire movie for.<br /><br />However, there were one or two things that troubled me about this story. There were many out-of-character moments that just irked me, but that's to be expected by the people who write the movies, and are not too familiar with the original manga.<br /><br />Though, I'm happy to say that this movie's animation is much more consistent and mirrors both the manga and anime stylings very well. The music is amazing, I was happy to see some of the old stuff from the first season mixed in there. "Four Seasons" at the end was also a very nice treat.<br /><br />All and all, I would say that this is one that needs to be seen by any fan, avid or not.
