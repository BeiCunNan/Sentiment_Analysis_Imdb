The senior Dumas' novel is turned into a knockoff of THE PRISONER OF ZENDA -- although as I have never read this Dumas novel, it may simply be returning the compliment.<br /><br />Director Karlson is not able to raise much of a performance from anyone except from Anthony Quinn, who plays his slimily villainous role with the appropriate cool aplomb. Still and all, besides the pleasures of Anthony-Quinn-watching, Karlson does manage to shoot the entire procedure with a goodly amount of visual beauty, with an MGM-style sumptuousness well displayed. Aside from these two point, however, this one is pretty much a washout.
