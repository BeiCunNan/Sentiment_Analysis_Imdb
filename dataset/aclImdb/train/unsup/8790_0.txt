This is a a very underrated film with many qualities. Somehow the parts don´t really add up but it´s still worth watching.<br /><br />The camera can´t get enough of Nastassja Kinski which is understandable since she is gorgeous. The films captures some of her feminine mystique and one can let oneself be seduced. The main weakness of the film is that it´s fragmented with parts that barely have anything holding them together except ms. Kinski.<br /><br />First she´s a midwestern farmgirl, then she goes to the BIG CITY and works as a waitress until -VOILA!- she´s discovered as a model! (which really is not at all unlikely as she is GORGEOUS). Then, she meets a mysterious man (European natch), follows him to France and gets involved with a terrorist group plotting to kill several people.<br /><br />But all this is very entertaining in a loose way with fine low-key performances from everyone. Nastassja is very good as the curious, open and vulnerable girl.<br /><br />So it´s the directors folly, but it´s very interesting to see the 80´s again, people like Nureyev, Harvey Kietel and Bibi Andersson, a terrorist groups´ way of thinking from the inside, and the looseness of the film is rather appealing if one can give reality a rest. I liked it.
