With the exception of his little knock-off horror/comedy "Hiruko The Goblin", I have loved all films I've seen by Shinya Tsukamoto and this is probably one of his best. It takes a while to understand what's going on, but the build-up is quite good and is creepy, bordering on disturbing. A doctor and his wife are staying with his parents, and the parents are not sure about the new bride, who claims to have amnesia but may be other than what she seems. When the father passes away, there is much mourning, and then when the mother arises to use the bathroom in the middle of the night she encounters a VERY strange character that literally scares the life out of her. And then there's the kindly doctor who is puttering about the garden who suddenly is attacked and ends up at the bottom of the well, only to realize that it seems to be himself that put him there? For he has an identical twin, it seems, and the twin has assumed his identity. Sure, there's a lot more to it than that, but you'll have to watch it to find out. Good use of eerie and unsettling music too. This is a bit more "arty" than earlier Tsukamoto films, but well worth seeing and very unsettling. Ryo as the wife Rin is quite good in her role and she seems almost "other-wordly" and to an extent, she IS from another world, of sorts. Well worth seeing for fans of creepy Asian cinema and if you've seen and liked other offerings from Tsukamoto (like Tetsuo, Snake of June), you'll like this. 9 out of 10.
