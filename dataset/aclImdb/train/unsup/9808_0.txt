Wake up people.<br /><br />Governments the world over don't care about you. They are run by human beings just like you. Some of you steal paper clips from work or enjoy sneaky perks.<br /><br />People with lots of power steal bigger things and commit more serious crimes.<br /><br />Let go of your misplaced respect for human beings in charge.<br /><br />They are not even in charge of themselves.<br /><br />Loose Change asks questions that few people want to know about.<br /><br />Funny how when tough questions are asked, dumb people come out with sledge hammers.<br /><br />These are only questions...little questions...but the people who don't want to know arm themselves to the teeth and viciously refute them all.<br /><br />They are subconsciously afraid of their inability to think.<br /><br />They love other people speaking for them.<br /><br />Humans hey. Strooth.<br /><br />Don't get angry when your government is questioned. Your government who is so powerful, but who let a gang of 'terrorists' infiltrate and kill thousands.<br /><br />See, there ain't nothing good about the government. Governments suck.<br /><br />Every military person, every politician, every analyst, every aide, every national security person should have resigned in disgrace after 911. Why are they still all there? You can almost see them getting fatter off the carcasses of the people they helped kill.<br /><br />These are evil narcissistic human beings.<br /><br />Why weren't they all sacked for gross incompetence? How do they sleep at night? There might be no bigfoot, no aliens, no JFK hit, no Loch Ness monster, no boogie man, no ghosts, no sixth sense, no magic, no god, no devil, no nothing....<br /><br />but there is the 911 lie.<br /><br />A terrorist's passport survived the horrific explosion and landed onto the street where an FBI agent was on the scene to bag it? Now come on!! The greatest minds in the field of steal structures use the term 'pancake theory' to explain the collapses? Spare me! Anyway, just keep flying that flag, salute your first in command, cook your sausages and enjoy the country that was peacefully inhabited by the soulful Indians many years ago.<br /><br />You are scum. White Europeans and their machinery and undustrialisation and their dollar value on everything has set the tone for the sad, sad state of affairs.<br /><br />But, hey, we are human beings. We are territorial. Dumb like apes. We guard our territory, we fight, we steal, we kill. We are dirty apes.<br /><br />But we also think.<br /><br />I think the official 911 story is rubbish.<br /><br />I think 99% of the population of the western world are primitive scum.<br /><br />I think Loose Change is melodramatic. It's one of many documentaries that uses stupid atmospheric music to aid its message.<br /><br />Like a shot gun, it misses a lot of the target...but some of the shot is on the mark...and those are the bits that hurt the people who believe the official story hook line and sinker.
