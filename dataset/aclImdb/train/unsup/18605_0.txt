Just seeing Daffy dressed up in Robin Hood's green-and-red outfit and playing the mandolin while singing is pretty funny in itself Porky Pig plays Friar Tuck. Well, he has the build.<br /><br />This Robin Hood is so unimpressive that the Friar is convinced it is "he." Daffy, er Robin, finally says, "Look - I'll prove I'm Robin Hood. See this guy passing by? I'll rob him of his gold and give it to some poor unworthy slob." Ahh, finally a Robin Hood who tells it like it is!<br /><br />From that point, this cartoon was a ripoff of the Road Runner. Daffy trying to rob the guy was exactly like Wile E. Coyote attempting to get the Road Runner. Every thing that happened to him, I've seen in RR cartoons. Did Daffy steal his act here from Wile? Since this came out in 1958, apparently so. The only thing original was the ending when Daffy says "Shake hands with Friar Duck." That was a great closing line.<br /><br />The best thing about this animated short was the color. This is another case in which the restoration job is fully appreciated because the forest colors are magnificent. It can be seen on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume Three.
