Story of Renaldo Arenas' life, a Cuban writer life during the revolutionary period in Cuba. Subtitled in parts, it is somewhat lengthy, and depressing. Renaldo is gay as well, which I didn't know going in, so some male gay love scenes weren't exactly what I had hoped for. He makes it to America during the 1980 boatlift, but promptly dies of AIDS a few years later. I think the book would've been better. D+
