Picked up this movie because the trailer's looked good and was not disappointed. Maybe just a little long, but the movie flows well - the lead character is likable and you care what happens to him and Hidalgo. Strange that they don't flesh out the other racers before the start though. We were interested in the story and did a little research - the basic facts appear true (he did indeed take part in this race) although there is a liberal amount of poetic license, of course.<br /><br />Thought Omar Shariff played a very good part and the rest of the cast gave good support.<br /><br />All in all, a good movie to curl up and enjoy with your chosen loved one !
