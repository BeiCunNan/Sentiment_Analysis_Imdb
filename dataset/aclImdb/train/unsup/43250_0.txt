Worst. Movie. EVER!!<br /><br />Nothing much more to say really. Just bad. This is my personal opinion of course, and I really did try to see god things in it. I just couldn't find them.<br /><br />The plot stinks. The actors don't even try. The special effects are so bad they would make any decent grandma cry. The music has as much of a mood making in it as a fridge.<br /><br />My advice? DON'T BOTHER!!! <br /><br />Go rent or buy another movie. And if you're here to see if the TV movie of the night is for you, and it's called KILLER ANTS, then just turn off the TV and find a good book. Or go visit a friend.
