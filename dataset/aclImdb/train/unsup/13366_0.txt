I loved it! What an amazing true story! It was fascinating to go into the 1950's Tongan culture and to see the love that that missionary had for those people. You could see how much he really loved his girlfriend, who he left in the U.S. That must have been so hard for him. I was so relieved when he made it back home safely and married her. The scenery was amazing and the acting was impeccable. It has taken the place of Titanic and Forrest Gump as my new favorite movie. I give it five stars! I'm buying it as soon as it comes out on DVD and VHS. I actually might go back to the theatre to see it again this weekend....
