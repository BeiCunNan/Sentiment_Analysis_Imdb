Mr Chopra stole the idea from "Catch me if you can" and added all that garbage Hindi Masaalaa. Direction was totally senseless. You can make a comedy, which has some sense. But looks like current Bombay Directors start from the base thinking that all public is stupid and they can put any "masaalaa" in movie, to stretch it for 3 hours as long as they put some top faces on screen and show some skin. If they wanted to copy from English movie, they could have done better job. They could have taken some lesson from "Angoor". But by making some foreigner walking around in India, with millions of dollars in his bag and Deputy Commissioner of Police dancing around in Clubs made it a total senseless movie. In short - A senseless movie, total waste of time and money.
