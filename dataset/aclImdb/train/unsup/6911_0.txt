This film premiers July 4th-17th at the Film Forum in NYC. It is going to be an exciting and groundbreaking film that I'm sure will create quite a buzz. I've seen the film and was truly awestruck by its profundity and brave exploration of women all over the world. The filmmaker, Jennifer, bares her soul as she uses herself as a tool to address the issues that face women no matter their background or ethnicity. It is a film that all should see, male or female, to better understand the world around us and the strides that still need to be taken to ensure equality and peace. Besides, its political and societal significance, Flying: Confessions of a Free Women, is also a compelling and soap opera like film that, despite its length, flies by in a whirlwind of emotional drama and hilarity. Thank you to Jennifer Fox for giving so many different women a voice. This film is a must see!
