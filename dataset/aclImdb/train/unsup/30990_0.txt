Keane is one of the finest films ever made. It is an intense "edge of your seat" movie about a difficult subject - mental illness, poverty, and the impact of these conditions on an innocent child. The director, Lodge Kerrigan and the leading actor, Damian Lewis (in an outstanding performance) manage to show us Keane's world with empathy and unflinching realism. It is the type of movie that stays in your mind for a long time. I hope the film receives the recognition deserved because it is a stand-out. Quality independent films should be rewarded and encouraged and are too-often overlooked. If you get the chance, see this movie!
