Ever since the frog jumped ship, it took some class with it. Finally the CW made a smart move and signed a Charmed/Buffy/Angel style show.<br /><br />Just enough evil to have a serious side, yet just enough "Sock" for its lighter side. This show was unexpectedly recommended by my father-in-law and I was instantly hooked. No extra super special effects but enough to make believable. Casting could not have been better. The "Dead Like Me" feel helps too. I didn't think it was possible to make a show of this genre without copycat characters, plot lines or even locations. I can't say enough good without spoilers. Only thing is you really get the most from the show from watching in order from 1 to 18. <br /><br />Can't WAIT for next season!!!
