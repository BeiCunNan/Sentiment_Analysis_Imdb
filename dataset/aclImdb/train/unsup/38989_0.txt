I can't say enough bad about this joke of a film. It has taken stereotypes to extremes.<br /><br />The writer obviously knew nothing about what the War of the States was about, taking only the false premise that it was all about slavery (and nothing else) and expanded on that as the main story line.<br /><br />The CSA seceded from the USA, not invaded it. The Constitution of the Confederate States also outlawed slavery. Something this film missed entirely. Just to name a couple of inaccuracies.<br /><br />This actually could have been a fun endeavor had they had not been so biased in their views of what it might have been like. This is worse than a Saturday night live script. And the fake commercials have imaginary products that are so revolting I could upchuck. The entire film in centered on what slavery would be like today in the writer's eyes.<br /><br />Don't waste your time as even the attempt at humour is sickening.
