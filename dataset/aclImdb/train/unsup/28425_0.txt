The first big screen flick for Canadian horror master David Cronenberg was this skin-crawling B horror movie.<br /><br />Residents of a high rise apartment building are being attacked by parasites that are turning them into crazed zombies with nothing but sexual assault on their minds! <br /><br />Shivers is an effectively disturbing movie, not unlike most of Cronenberg's later horror classics. It's had a good hand in influencing later creature flicks. The story has a good premise and builds some terrific tension as it escalates to a great claustrophobic climax. What's clever about this movie is that most of the horror is suggested, we don't see the parasites much and their elusiveness just helps to create more tension. The makeup effects are decent for a low budgeter and the cast turn in some adequate performances, horror veteran Barbara Steele is a nice addition to the cast.<br /><br />Shivers is a entertaining slice of B horror that manages to live up to its title well. A must-see for Cronenberg fans.<br /><br />*** out of ****
