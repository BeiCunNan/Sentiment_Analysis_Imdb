This is another movie full of stereotypes! A white Eminem Vanilla Ice wannabe is trying to be a rapper. He acts black. What is the definition of acting black? He talks slang and almost sabotaged his dad's political career. Then some black actors who are acting white, (define acting white) Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson, starts acting black and kidnaps him and takes him to the ghetto. Fly Regina Hall pretends to like the white guy, but sabotages his good time with two other fly black girls. She ends up really liking him in the end. Look for a cameo appearance by Niecy Nash in this movie. There are a lot of stereotypical crazy adventures in this movie.
