Legendary bad movie (Just ask Michael Medved who put it in one of his bad movie books) about a movie producer who's producing a string of flops. in en effort to get humanity back into his pictures he hires a small town girl to be his Miss Humanity and help him steer pictures in the right direction. Beautiful Technicolor turkey thats as wrong headed as the movie its suppose to be about. Full of ballet, opera and the finer things the film also boasts low grade humor from the Ritz Brothers, some middle of the road Gershwin songs and Charlie McCarthy. Its a movie or the upper brow, or what the low class would think is high class. Unfunny with a sense of humor that is off four ways to Sunday this movie elicits the gag reflex not the laugh reflex. Whats worse is that any humor that works gets lost via the "artistic" bits of opera and ballet. I won't even get into the romance which is just plain fake. A road accident of a film rightly consigned to one of the all time bad lists.
