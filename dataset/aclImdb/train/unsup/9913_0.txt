It's not that this is a terribly awful film, but it would take at least some effort to view it at this point. I tried numerous download sites, checked websites after i read favourable right ups. It is not worth the effort.<br /><br />A sub standard, weak, predictable and at time plain awful plot, bad acting, no real threat. Save your time and do something more productive.<br /><br />I would recommend that rather than watching this you spend the time looking for other, better, films to watch. <br /><br />If you've somehow stumbled upon this title, the odds are you will find another one that's much better in no time.
