Okay, call me stupid. Or whatever. But I kept watching this twisting writhing thing I would a sick snake, simply because it did not make much sense. But these spy things are always a bit like that, tough to make because they are kind of cheap magician tricks, what do you show and what do you hide and if you hide too much its boring or confusing and you show too much and there is not a mystery. The first and foremostest was all the jabberwocky about codes. It would take a cryptologist to follow three quarters of the dialog, my head kept spinning, the pestle with the mestle has the brew that is true, et cetera et cetera et cetera, as the King of Siam would say. But it was kind of fun, and without being confused I suppose I would not have believed these characters. But then the business with the drive in the country, winding up in the barn, and all that, the movie really started to unravel. In the end I felt I was on some carnival midway hustled into a sideshow, and had to keep both hands over my pockets with just one wallet, so paranoid they were somehow gonna use the back pockets maybe to get to it, these tricky guys. In udder words, was not taken in, just paranoid. If this is a Tom Stoppard excursion into Pinterland, shrug. Double shrug. Also you always have to be careful about flashbacks piled upon flashbacks, the way this baby kept stacking them up: another movie that revolves around a disappearance, though without a single flashback, and gets it effects a lot more successfully , L"Aventura, in fact there are certain parallels that are fairly striking, even down to the girl friend and boy friend of the gone one winding up in each others arms, though one is a masterpiece, mostly, and this one a mismash. Kate Winslet however turns in her usual striking performance. Without her I would have shut it down after fifteen minutes. But anytime she is on screen, it's worth watching.
