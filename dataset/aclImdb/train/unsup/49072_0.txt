Warning, some potential spoilers await.<br /><br />Really, how many hits does it take to knock someone silly or knock them out?<br /><br />The inane female characters in this film hit the main villain not one, not two, not three, but four separate times (that I could count) in the head, then would leave the area to have him recover and go on his killing spree again within a matter of seconds.<br /><br />I recognize that horror films are thin on plot, but this one is so thin on plot there is absolutely no motive as to why the killer does what he does besides his uncle who was a cop and died? Is that reason enough to go on a rampage killing a bevy of teenage kids? Obviously the writers and director thought so. Oh yeah watch out for the sly stereotypes as well, like the stupid policeman that is Irish, OH THE HILARITY!
