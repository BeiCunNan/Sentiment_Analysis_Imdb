and it was great. the movie had a good balance of drama and comedy, leaning more towards the comedy side as they are lots of light saber fights and David Prowse writing on a Darth Vader fake Darth Vaders light saber "David Prowse is the only Darth Vader". that had me cracking up.<br /><br />at the screening, the director was there, along with Joe Urban, George Starkey, and someone the IMDb doesn't have on there cast list, the guy who played the Fake George Lucas who was Asian. no Jim Peterson, the guy who played Hank though. i really wanted to meet him, as he seemed like a really funny guy.<br /><br />for any filmmakers out there, i got a word of advice for you. when your movie is lagging a bit towards the middle, put in a random fast paced event. it works like a charm to make the movie interesting again.<br /><br />-Gameboybob
