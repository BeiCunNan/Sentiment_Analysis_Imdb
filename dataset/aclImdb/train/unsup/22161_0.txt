I HATED this movie, and in fact, I turned it off. I didn't watch the whole thing.<br /><br />My mom and I had heard that the movie was really funny, so we wanted to see it when we saw it that it was on the on demand thing through her cable company. When the movie starts off, it looks like the Delta house in Animal House. Then as the movie goes on, you see Kent aka Flounder raiding the kitchen, and then you see Eric Stration! I was like can they get any more people from the movie Animal House. I am not sure if they did or not, because we got to the part where the "preppy" kids are talking to the guy in the woods and turned it off. It was just stupid, and we didn't find it funny at all!
