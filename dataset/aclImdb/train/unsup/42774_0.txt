A prime example of a poor film. Ignoring the story we are left with a film that lacks energy and drive. The characters are flat and lifeless and you are left hoping they all die. Rutger Hauer turns in a rare poor performance, was he ill at the time? He does not even do his own sword fight yet we know he is capable as seen in Blind Fury in fact he doesn't move much at all. Impossible to believe that someone put up money for the Tv series after seeing this, yet surely this is the first time that a TV show is better than the film that inspired it.
