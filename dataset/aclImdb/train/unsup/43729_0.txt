This could be interesting, historical film if made properly, but it definitely isn't. Oldest polish legend is base of original novel. But you see not much of it in this movie and it's not so easy to understand even for polish who know original. Sadly weakest side is actors' play. This is typical curse of every high-budget (as for polish movies - 10-15 mln.$). Best actors don't try to be professional but they think that this is just prize for being best-known people in polish entertainment, so no need to put any effort if you paid part of cast already. Overall - weak, boring and acted poorly. It looks like C-class US production. 2/10. If you want some interesting polish production look for lower budget, but much better made movies.
