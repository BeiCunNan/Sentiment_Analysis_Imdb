If you're watching for the purpose of learning how not to make a movie, or how to make a movie for less than the cost of one episode of Trailer Park Boys. I watched because I had an inkling that Kate Todd might actually be able to act, but even if she was an Oscar winner, she couldn't have made this good. Just too low budget to be worth it. If my sister, and her friends made it, I would be surprised, but only because I'd wonder how the f they got a bear to not eat them. Funny, for about 10 seconds, then it is an absolute waste of time. You'll spend a lot of the movie not paying attention, maybe flipping to other channels, as I did, and coming back and saying, didn't something happen that would stop that person from completely walking? Why is that person OK now? Or something? I doesn't make any sense at all. It makes about as much sense as Doctor Seuss having a tea party with Frasier Crane and Peter Griffin, All while on LSD and talking about the recent downturn in the economy of slippers.
