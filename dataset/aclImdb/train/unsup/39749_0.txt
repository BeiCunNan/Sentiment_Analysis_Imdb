A cheap movie - and not only because it is low budget. The action pretends to be about a cheating scheme in the high tech capitalist venture world. It actually is just confusing and predictable at the same time. Directing and camera work are close to ridicule, and acting does not get higher than low quality TV dramas. Steve Baldwin is shaming the Baldwin name by participating in this movie. Even the erotic scenes seem to be just there to fill in the time. 4/10 on my personal scale. Avoid it!
