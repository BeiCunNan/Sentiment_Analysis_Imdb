As a person closer to this story than I care to divulge, I can say that this movie is hardly a true story. Ed Amos did kill 4 people (at least) and is serving a life sentence. However, the movie itself makes a mockery of the real people involved and it makes me sick to my stomach that the producers of this movie would claim it to be based on a true story. Not because it is not "based" on a true story, but because by labeling it as such, every single person who watches this movie and does not have access to the real story will assume every moment of it to have actually taken place. The reality is that it is a nearly entirely fictional film that uses the names of actual people. Not a single interview was conducted before production . That said, I do not know what else I could have expected from the Lifetime network. Families of the deceased deserved better.
