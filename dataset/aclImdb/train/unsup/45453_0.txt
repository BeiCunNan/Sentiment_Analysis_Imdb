I'll be perfectly blunt, here. The only reasonable excuse to even consider watching this Heathers/Carrie rip-off is Rose McGowan's aka Courtney Shane's tits! THAT'S IT!! That and staring at a cute Rebecca Gayheart aka "The Noxema Girl" aka the "The Worst Driver on Earth". <br /><br />Ahem, anyway, he acting is absolutely hideous and as deeply intellectual as a listening to a gossipy bimbo cheerleader gabbing on her cellphone in the BMW convertible daddy bought her. As far as the dialog goes, Are you kidding me? Who wrote this movie? Seriously. Who? A group of drunk perverted frat boys on spring break. If the directors, producers, and writers were more serious in their work and had more in the way of detectable I.Q. level, Jawbreaker would've been a little more funny and witty...like Heathers! It would've been a little more satirical...like Heathers! And It would've been a little more of cult classic...like Heathers! But, Alas this movie isn't Heathers it's another poorly planned teen movie with a big budget with an ego to match that does little but annoy the crap out of everyone. It's only good to watch if nothing else is on and seeing Courtney receiving her faux-Carrie comeuppance in the end. The only other redeeming qualities Jawbreaker has besides the obvious symbolism of sex appeal is the scenery with it's avant-garde neo-60's style.<br /><br />I don't like this movie since it marked the beginning of the millennium in which all women on a screen look, dress, and act like the skanks in this pathetic teen crap fest! You can say this started a trend. Now if this had quality instead of an excuse to rush sex appeal to the market, "Jawbreaker" would've been a better movie than it was. Don't get me wrong. I don't hate this movie...it could've been a little funnier and satirical instead of just a bunch of beautiful people backstabbing each other sans modus operandi.
