Probably the worst movie I've seen in awhile.<br /><br />Seems to be a very insular New Yorker oriented movie with no particular direction or point. Very slow. A mix of peculiar and pretentious.<br /><br />If someone has told you this movie is a comedy, it is not. It is more like an ensemble slice- of-life that follows 5 sets of people in New York. The only even amusing portion of the movie is the part which follows a couple of middle-aged, east-Indian body guards. The other stories are not particularly interesting and even annoying. Various good actors are wasted, including Maggie Gyllenhaal, Olympia Dukakis and Stephen Colbert.<br /><br />I suppose this movie is supposed to reflect the unease of New yorkers after 9-11, but if so it seems the worst sort of exploitation. The movie mostly just causes unease.<br /><br />See this movie if you like scenes of post 9-11 New York and you don't mind being bored and uncomfortable for about an hour and a half.
