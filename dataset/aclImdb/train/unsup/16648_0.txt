There are great movies that few would dispute. Then, there are poor movies that few should watch. This is neither. "My Blue Heaven" is up for grabs. However, if you like light-hearted comedies with scenes that are bright and cheerful, THIS is your movie. This movies doesn't attempt to contribute in any significant way to the art of film. Rather, it is an obvious attempt to please the audience. I am not ashamed to admit that it did exactly that for me. I wouldn't call this a "great film" but certainly entertaining and uplifting. It lacks the intelligence of "When Harry Met Sally" (another Ephron written film) but that isn't needed in this movie. If you are feeling "blue" and need a lift-me-up, this is for you.
