What was Joan Crawford thinking when she accepted this incredibly bad 1937 vehicle?<br /><br />A woman and her gang of thieves plan to steal gems from a wealthy family. Crawford, as Mrs. Cheney, is that woman who plays up to Robert Montgomery, in order to be invited to the home of his wealthy aunt.<br /><br />The Crawford character is in cahoots with William Powell. The film goes bad as this is a comedy. Had this been a drama with Crawford playing a brassy woman, this would have been something. Otherwise, the film goes downhill quickly once Crawford has been found out. Crazily, a letter has been sent by Frank Morgan, one of the aristocrats to Mrs. Cheney, which describes the negative side of these wealthy patrons. Crawford and Powell try getting some money out of Morgan, and when they do, they promptly relinquish it. Powell goes willingly to jail while Mrs. Cheney finds her true love in Montgomery. To believe this misery, you have to be quite a fool. O yes, Jesse Ralph is around as the dowager aunt. Even her hearty laugh can't save this mess of a film.
