Dustin Hoffman's performance as comic Lenny Bruce is brilliant and I agree with those who say he is one of the greatest actors in cinema history. Indeed the production of the whole film - scripting, acting, directing, editing - is superb. It was obviously shot in black and white to convey a period (early 1950s to early 1960s) documentary feel and it works. There is probably more comedy in some of the off-stage scenes, particularly the courtroom repartee, than the stage performances which seem designed to demonstrate why he irritated a lot of people at the time. By today's standards the "obscenity" all seems quite tame, and comedians such as Billy Connelly and Rowan Atkinson are just as crude and manage to have their performances shown on TV without a whisper of complaint (at least not in this part of the world). The difference is that Lenny Bruce had a lot to say about social and political issues of the day, some of which get presented in this film. It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but highly recommended as an example of excellent movie making.
