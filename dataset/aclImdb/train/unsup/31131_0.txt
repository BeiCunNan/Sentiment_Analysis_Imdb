The first two Spider-Man games based off the films were flat out awesome! I'm big on voice talents, graphics, and gameplay. Those things matter to me most of all. Spider-Man 3, great graphics, the gameplay for PC is a little shaky. Tobey, like always, blows me away as Spider-Man and Peter. He's hysterical in-game! Bruce Campbell is a real treasure as the tour guide. The game is good. Kirsten didn't come back to do the voice for MJ in the third game. What really shocks me is that Bryce Dallas Howard, who played Gwen Stacy in the film, didn't provide the voice for her character. I mean, Gwen isn't even in the game! What are you guy's thinking?!!! AaaaarrrrrgggghhH! For those who loved the film, for those who love the soundtrack, for those who love the book based off of the film, I recommend that you skip this game entirely. Toby is the only real highlight of the game. Unlike the second game, where the pedestrians talk with Spidey and comment him while you're swinging around the city, the third game is completely dead in this area. And also, you could hear the wind blow past you as you swing faster in the second game. There's no wind here. He swings in the same way every time for this game too. It get's boring quickly, unlike the first and second games. I loved the film, but, this is the first game in the Spidey franchise that has left me disappointed! I LOVE Spider-Man 2 for Gamecube and the first Spider-Man Movie game!! But, Spidey 3, yuck! Good graphics, but the rest is just plain bad. And, it got too hard WAY TO FAST! The difficulty didn't gradually progress as you went along!!
