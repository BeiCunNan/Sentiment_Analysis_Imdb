One of the worst zombie movies I've ever seen. Even for a B grade movie it was horrible. Some of the acting is passable, but the script with its dozens of plot holes goes from bad to worst as it drags on and on and gets more confusing as each moment passes. The editing is probably the worst thing about this movie. It almost reminds me of the horrible editing in the early silent movies when film was so expensive you had to take the shot you got and often the cuts didn't match. Well, expense couldn't have been an issue because you can tell by the grainy effects that it was filmed on digital cameras.<br /><br />Seriously... I want my 5 bucks back for the rental fee of this DVD.
