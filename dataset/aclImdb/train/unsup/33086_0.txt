Oh my God does Yashraj films think like how normal people do? Okay the plot is okay 2 people want to make it big but can't because they have no money and their scenes at the start are nice but the robbery part is so stupid<br /><br />How does Rani, Abhishek get the expensive clothes for the first crime? Then every robbery so fast is too much to believe Even Dhoom 2 Mr. A looks more believable<br /><br />The entire love angle, marriage front of Taj MBhal is even weirder Amitabh's characterization too fails to leave a mark The entire climax is even worst The scene together between Amitabh and Abhishek before Kajra Re is the worst scene ever featuring them<br /><br />Shaad ALi goes 100 steps backward from SAATHIYA Music is saving grace but too many songs<br /><br />Abhishek acts well, overdoes at places but is good Rani irritates with her voice but does some scenes well, her performance is over-hyped Amitabh bachchan is alright
