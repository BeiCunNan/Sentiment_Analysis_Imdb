Ever since seeing it when first released I have waited to find a worse film. The only value in having witnessed this atrocity is the retelling of the experience. It is a good thing to be able to say, "This is the worst movie I have ever seen."<br /><br />Now IMDb is asking me to fill in at least 10 lines of text in order to meet the minimum requirement of review length. Unlike Dead Boyz Can't Fly, however, I know when to leave well enough alone. It's unfortunate that the solution to whatever problem the IMDb people are trying to avoid happens to infringe on the finer qualities of a succinct and pithy piece of writing.
