It's a real treat to see in the modern times the film as good as "Candyman".When I first saw this movie about six years ago it scared the hell out of me.It's a shame that most of the modern horror movies can't scare me like "Candyman" did.The mysterious killer Candyman is really frightening with his very deep voice that sends chills down your spine(Tony Todd-you are great!).The ending is a little bit anti-climatic,but who cares?Personally I love bad endings.Kudos also for Clive Barker.This guy can make a good,creepy horror movie("Hellraiser" and "Master of Illusion" are great as well).Highly recommended.The sequel is also worth checking out.
