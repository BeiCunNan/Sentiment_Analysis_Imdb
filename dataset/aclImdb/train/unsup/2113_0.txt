I've seen this three times. Each time I have enjoyed it even more. In my opinion it is truly the best animated movie of 1998!<br /><br />The special effects stunning and the character design refreshing. All in all, Dreamworks has a winner. Not bad for a crew that comprises mostly of very talented European Artists who were not all poached from Disney.
