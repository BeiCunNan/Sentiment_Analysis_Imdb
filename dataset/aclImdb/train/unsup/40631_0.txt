A film about a woman losing her son and her boyfriend. OK. I don't mind a little sentimentality and art-movies. I also like good drama movies f.ex. Midnight cowboy, The last picture show and Peggy Sue got married. This film, however, centers around a woman feeling very for herself. And that is definitaly not entertaining on ANY level. It is just plain boring. 1 out of 10.
