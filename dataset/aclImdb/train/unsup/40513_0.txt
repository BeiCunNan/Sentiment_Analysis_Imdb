Evidently a cult movie with the homosexual set, The Crying Game is a homoerotic fantasy based on a deeply disturbed transvestite character, Dil, implausibly mixed up in Irish terrorism. The blurb speaks dishonestly and misleadingly of the film as "a romantic thriller" without disclosing its homosexual character. Irish terrorists should sue. The film should carry a health warning.
