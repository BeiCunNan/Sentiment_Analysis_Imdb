Of course it is! Twenty years on from its original release, good to see it doing the rounds at the cinemas again to rave reviews. I think that it was probably the last great musical that will ever be made, a thought which saddens me....but times, attitudes and financial considerations have changed. The cast of the film perform as one unit....the interplay between the various character parts is at times electric. The songs and dance routines are simply marvellous. All the ingredients of a cinema classic are there for all too see. It is my mother's favourite film, my favourite film and my childrens' favourite film. Three generations can't be wrong!
