This movie was Horrible!!!!!!! My 13 year old daughter and 10 year old son were laughing at how bad this movie was. I rented it thinking it was another Deep Blue Sea and instead we got a Sci-Fi movie of the week full of stock footage.<br /><br />This takes place deep under water and yet many of the shark attack scenes show a shark swimming at the surface.<br /><br />The plot is incredibly thin. Who would design a research platform that when exposed to some trauma where the life support was cutoff would require the occupants to swim outside to engage the back up life support? We are told in the movie at 1 point that they have a 10 minute supply of air and yet fires are raging out of control all over the station.<br /><br />The acting is shoddy!!!!! Save yourselves people!!!! It's too late for me. Don't rent this
