I'll admit I didn't actually watch this movie from the beginning, I only caught the end. However, in that time, myself and my friend definitely noted at least 5 instances where this "film" could have shifted into one of those 1 am shows on Cinemax. Honestly the transition would have been seamless. Starting from the scene in the prison to the end of the movie with the delivery boy, sexual innuendo abounded. Add to that the cheesy dialogue, mediocre special effects, and paper-thin plot and you have the makings of a fairly good skin flick. Seriously all that was missing was some steamy scenes and a pizza guy.
