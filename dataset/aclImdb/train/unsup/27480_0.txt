In my opinion, this is an excellent holiday special which is very hip and hilarious. However, I couldn't bear seeing Marcie (voice of Peter Robbins) having to boil all those Easter eggs herself while Peppermint Patty yelled at her so she would do it right. In addition, the thing that really makes this special worth watching is the score, especially "Linus And Lucy." When that song is performed, I always get warm and tingly. I would have to say that's my favorite song of this special. If you ask me, Charles M. Schulz was a really good artist. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent Easter special which is very hip and hilarious to everyone, especially all you fans of the comic strip who have not seen it. When you see it, prepare to smile and have a good time.
