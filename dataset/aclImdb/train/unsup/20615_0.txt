At times this documentary was disturbing, talking about pogroms and mass slaughter; then, in the next scene, the topic will switch to Monty Python. And Terry Jones (a former Python) actually makes it work! Watch it (provided you have 4 hours on your hands). You'll learn lots and won't get bored--I promise.
