I saw the Buttercream gang when I was sixteen,my brothers and I popped it in our VHS Player and sat back to watch it.We ended up making snide comments the whole time.I'm a Christain and love good quality movies,but this thing was so cheesy and happy sappy I think I got a cavity from watching it.They try to overdramatise the serious parts. The Buttercream Gang is so perfectly good it makes you sick. The town is so small they preacher plays triple duty. Even the bad kid isn't that bad he shoplifts a couple of sodas (I think) the bullies aren't that scary,I mean what's so bad about riding your bike around the nerdy girl granted she'd get dizzy ,but still. The boys had a treehouse they're supposed to be 12 or 14 whatever way too old for a treehouse .I'm not sure I quite the moral of the story unless it was Don't move to big cities like Chicago or New York or you'll turn into a gang member and not the good kind either . The one good thing about the movie was the song that played toward the end and the credits other than it was horrible .
