I was kind of scared going into this ppv do to 2 old farts, Hogan & Flair wrestling but it turned out to be better than I thought. RVD defeated Jericho is a great match to advance to the finals. Then Brock Lesnar defeated Test in a crappy match to face RVD in the finals. In the finals Brock defeated RVD to become the 2002 King of the Ring, the match was good I guess but way too short so that was extremely disappointing. Jamie Noble defeated the Hurricane to become the new cruiserweight champ in a decent match although the crowd was really dead in it. Ric Flair defeated Eddie Guerrero with some help from Bubba. Molly defeated Trish to become the new woman's champion, thank God. Kurt Angle defeated Hulk Hogan and the dead man Undertaker defeated Triple H to retain his undisputed title.
