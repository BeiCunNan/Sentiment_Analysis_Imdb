I think the animated series Astro Boy is more reminded because of ts cultural meaning than for its intrinsic attributes, because it was the first "anime" which found popularity outside of its natal Japan.Personally, I have never seen that series, so I went with zero expectations to see its film adaptation.However, the movie ended up being a boring, bland and cloying clothing which combines elements from A.I., Wall-E and Peter Pan.<br /><br />This film has a lot of clich√©s and pre-fabricated characters.Besides, there are too many irrelevant sub-plots which distract the attention from the story.The only positive point I found in here is that the voice cast (composed by Freddie Highmore, Nicolas Cage, Samuel L. Jackson, Charlize Theron, Kristen Bell, Donald Sutherland, Bill Nighy and Eugene Levy) makes a functional work.<br /><br />Astro Boy is another horrible animation film from Hollywood, which is truly boring and irritating, at the same time it lacks of any creativity.I suggest you to avoid it.
