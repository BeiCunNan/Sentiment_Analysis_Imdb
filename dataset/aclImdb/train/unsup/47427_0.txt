The Hollywood movers and shakers who decide which scripts are given the green light ought to be ashamed of themselves.<br /><br />The actors who signed up for this debacle should have known better.<br /><br />The behind-the-scenes crew must've kept their mouths shut while filming the Irwin Allen production, knowing that the final product was going to be garbage.<br /><br />There must have been a conspiracy within the Costume Design branch of the Academy Awards for nominating this and "The Swarm" two years earlier for the bland clothing right off the store shelves from Sears or K-Mart (or whatever store that was close to the Warner Brothers' Burbank studios lot or on location in Hawaii).<br /><br />And I'm not going to discuss the poor blue screen effects, the cheap miniature effects or the actor's laughable reaction shots.<br /><br />While writing this review, I realized that "When Time Ran Out" and "Airplane!" were both released in 1980. I guess it speaks volumes when a silly but unintentionally funny disaster movie was a flop and a silly but intentionally funny disaster spoof was a hit.
