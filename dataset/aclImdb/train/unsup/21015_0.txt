The Return of Jafar was a disappointment to me. Maybe because it followed a great Disney classic. It contained horrible animation. The songs weren't that great. The only upside was the story was good , but not good enough to make this movie a favorite.Also , Robin Willaims was not the voice of the genie which was another downside.<br /><br />The main plot is Jafar escapes from the lamp and wants revenge on Aladdin , and Iago escapes and becomes good and helps Aladdin defeat Jafar. I don't have a favorite song because I don't like any of them. If you see this in stores , and start to think if you should buy it or not , I say , don't.<br /><br />4/10
