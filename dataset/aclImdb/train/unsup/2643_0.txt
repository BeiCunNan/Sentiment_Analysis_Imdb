The thing that struck me most about this program is that meerkats are more interesting than any Big Brother series. It has a distinct Big Brother style situation with cameras situated around a family of meerkats and it follows their everyday movements. The group is dominated by 'Flower'. The voice-over is totally hilarious as well for example; "Flower has been the only female in the family allowed to have babies, a) because she loves being the centre of attention, and b) because she's a psychopath" The program is what show like Big Brother and Celebrity Love Island want to be. The show is just a great piece of television, whether its the members of the family sneaking of to a different clan to have a quick nookie or to the young-ones fighting off elders for bits of scorpion!.
