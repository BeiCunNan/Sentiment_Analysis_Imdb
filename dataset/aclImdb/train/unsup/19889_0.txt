Christopher Guest has been making great comedies for years, his true to life warts and all mockumentaries have not only been the source of much amusement but have also paved the way for shows like 'The Office' so it no surprise that his latest offering has Ricky Grevais in it. Based around the buzz for Oscar glory and the extremes people go to it is simply hilarious and full of the usual bunch of crazy characters. Using many of the same actors he always does and his unique improvising technique of not sticking to a fixed script it gives people the chance to shine and really make the roles their own. The humour ranges from in your face laugh out loud to brilliantly subtle and never let's up, so much so I thought at one point I would choke. Not quite as good as 'Best In Show' but much better than 'A Mighty Wind' this film is the first he's done that is a straight story instead of a documentary style although he has cleverly woven elements of that in to this film through the actors doing interviews for various television shows and specials. It is a clever and funny side swipe at the industry and all its winners and losers and it puts Guest and co-writer Eugene Levy back at the top of the pile. Not afraid to poke fun at itself this film should delight fans and hopefully gain a few new ones. A triumphant return to form for all involved and it proves that you don't have to gross out and be extreme to be funny.
