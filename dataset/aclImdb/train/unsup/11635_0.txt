Being that I was in my early 20s I remember very well the 80s, which was I need to be perfect decade. Smarts took a back-seat to buff & tan. Everyone was pumping iron, getting tan, blow-drying their hair, checking their look in the mirror, and flaunting their bods. Gosh! Darn! It sounds exactly like South Beach today!! Nothing has changed!<br /><br />What is a shock is how badly John Travola and Jaime Lee Curtis have aged. They were both so "perfect" in 1985. There's no excuse for a "sex-Symbol" like Johnny T. to have gotten so bloated and out-of-shape. Hey, don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Travolta. However his best work(aside from Pulp Fiction) was made in the late 70s and early 80s-Carrie, Saturday Night Fever, Grease, Urban Cowboy, and even for its time, Perfect. <br /><br />And Jaime Lee was so beautiful, so well-built, and so sexy. Oh well, thank goodness for videos.<br /><br />Funny how today's generation thinks the out-fits in this film were so strange. I look at the out-fits today and I think they are really "stranger" than anything we wore in the 80s.
