Maybe I'm missing something here, but I find this show to be a case of much ado about nothing. I was intrigued with the premise enough to watch a few episodes, but once one gets past the fact that three of the cast members are dwarfs, there is nothing remarkable about this family whatsoever. They seem like a nice enough clan, with their comfortably cluttered house, occasionally bratty kids and a few bothersome health issues... just like pretty much every other family I know. After watching an episode devoted almost entirely to the astonishingly unremarkable task of cleaning the twins' room, I vowed never to waste another 30 minutes of my life in the same manner again. I mean really - if I wanted to see dirty clothes strewn about and dust bunnies under the bed, I could have just gone upstairs. The show is to be commended for attempting to educate viewers about little people and demonstrate how they are essentially "just like you and me", but that is also its downfall - for ordinariness simply hasn't made for compelling TV viewing since the days of "Father Knows Best".
