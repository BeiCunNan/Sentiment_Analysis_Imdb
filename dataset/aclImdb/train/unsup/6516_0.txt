manmadhan is a must-watch flick for all movie-lovers,youngsters and particularly the NEW GENERATION GIRLS.the theme of the movie was very apt to modern times and the taking of the film was good.specifically the screenplay of the movie was too good,very appreciative on simbhu's part.in other movies they really do not show to the viewers,on the screen,something which turns out to be......-i just don't wanna reveal.simbhu is too young to make someone like me to expect such amazing work from him.becoz i always thought simbhu lacks smart looks.but only after watching manmadhan did i realise that for an actor -his/her looks count nothing at all-all that matters is the FINE SKILL OF ACTING that lies within him/her.simbhu's performance as a "pretending to be a psycho" in the beginning of the movie was really cool.Oh no...!!!!!!i just forgot to mention about sindhu tolani who played the sweet,cute but.......in this flick.her performance was just beyond accolades and appreciation acc. to me.all the hot models in the movie-who played the MODERN GIRLS-added a bit more charm to manmadhan.finally jo(jyotika) was nice and good as usual.this movie once again makes all south indians spellbound by the genius of tamil film-making.
