In browsing the comments for "Sunset Blvd.," I see that virtually all of them tend to understand that this happens to be one of the best pictures ever made. Don't just ask me, ... or the majority of the other posters here..., consult with The National Film Registry and the American Film Institute.<br /><br />Atmospheric, well acted and shot, an intelligent and slightly offbeat script, and a host of themes explored. What more could you want from a film? <br /><br />For those of you who cavil about this one, I find myself remembering how in the early 90's I would have sworn that "Old Style," or "Michelob" were the epitome of beers. It is only after I'd experienced a host of better potables that I become an adequate judge of real quality. For those of you who dismiss "Sunset Blvd.," I have to wonder just what IS a quality film in your estimation? While I don't particularly care for Led Zeppelin or Jimi Hendrix, I can appreciate that they are above average talents, just not my cup of tea. So, maybe it's NOT the movie, perhaps it's you.
