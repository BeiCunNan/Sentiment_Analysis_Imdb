Man, i can't even remember when was the time i saw this... A few years back, that's for sure. Why won't i re-watch it before commenting? 'Cuz i was freakin' bored for the first time too! The story is neither sophisticated nor original. A modern Romeo'n'Juliet thingie between a gypsy boy and a 'white' girl. But don't worry, it gets worse... Of course, as all films showing a minority, this one is also full of whining about how gypsies are oppressed, etc. Yet, even on the screen, they deepen the preconception of the criminal minority. Bravo! It has a few society-critical parts too, but after the main storyline being that weak, i just couldn't feel the punch lines... Visuals. The most important part of an animation, isn't it? Well, the look of the whole is not that bad at all. Just a bit ugly for me. Imagine 'a scanner darkly' with even less hand-work and less continuity between frames. It looks good, while it's still. In original language (Hungarian that is), characters have the voices of some famous Hungarian actors who also appear in the movie as they were all digitalized. The known faces and voices do good to the title, but won't save it. But the stars are unknown names, who can't show their talents due to the animation. Oh, and they sing too. Wish they weren't.<br /><br />All in all, the movie is not hopeless, and surely not the worst movie of all time, just wasn't worth the state money it got. By a long shot.
