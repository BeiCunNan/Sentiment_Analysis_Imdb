THE BODYGUARD, in my opinion, is a great Whitney Houston movie. One of the greatest things about this movie, in my opinion, is the music. I thought that Rachel (Whitney Houston) sounded really good. My favorite song of THE BODYGUARD is "I Have Nothing." Also, in my opinion, Frank (Kevin Costner) was really attractive, strict, a good bodyguard, and business-like. I thought that Rachel looked very beautiful in the dress she wore to the Oscars and that Frank looked good in the tuxedo he wore to the Oscars. Also, if you ask me, he and Rachel made a really cute couple. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to all you Kevin Costner or Whitney Houston fans who have not seen it. I absolutely guarantee you you're going to enjoy it.
