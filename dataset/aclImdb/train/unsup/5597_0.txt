Quentin Tarantino rates this as the best movie of all time,and who am I to argue with him?I first saw this movie when I had first started surfing,and it really captured all that was great about the sport,and the way of life that surfing becomes.<br /><br />As I have gotten older I can completely relate to the changes the characters go through,as even surfers have to grow up sometime,and its only then that you realize the significance of the more innocent times of youth when life really is a lot more simple and a whole lot of fun.<br /><br />This movie is beautifully scripted,acted and directed.The on-board surfing shots are unreal and still hold up to the test of time.Surely the best surfing and coming of age movie ever made,and quite possibly just the best movie ever!10 out of 10.
