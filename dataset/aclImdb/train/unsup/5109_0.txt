This movie is very good. The movie begins when Kishenlal (Pran), a taxi driver for the gangster Robert (Jeevan) returns to his wife Bharati (Nirupa Roy) and sons after spending many years in prison because of a crime committed by Robert. He is furious to see that they have no food and the sons are nearly starved to death. He immediately goes to Robert to get revenge, but is humiliated by him. In the process, Kishenlal escapes with booty, steals a car and drives away to his family through a raging storm. But before he arrives, Bharati runs away leaving a suicide note. Kishenlal then takes his sons with him while being chased by Robert's henchmen. Upon reaching a park, Kishenlal leaves his sons there and drives away to divert his enemies and the police from his path. However, his car meets with an accident and falls from the cliff, but Kishenlal survives with the money. Bharati is still running away to commit suicide. Suddenly a big branch falls on her, completely blinding her. She then becomes homeless and thinks that her husband and sons are dead.<br /><br />Meanwhile the sons are each adopted by a childless man in the park. The eldest, Amar (Vinod Khanna) is adopted by a Hindu police officer and grows up to be a police officer as well. The second son, Anthony (Amitabh Bachchan) is adopted by a Christian priest and becomes a hoodlum on the streets, while the youngest, Akbar (Rishi Kapoor) is adopted by a Muslim tailor and becomes a Qawwali singer. The rest of the movie is about how the family is reunited. Very good movie. The songs where excellent ! (Kishore Kumar sang for Amitabh Bachchan, while Mohammed Rafi sang for Rishi Kapoor.) Amitabh won his first Filmfare Best Actor Award in this movie. Laxmikant-Pyarelal got the Best Music Director award as well. This movie is very good. Excellent cinematography, performance & direction. It is watch worth. ****.
