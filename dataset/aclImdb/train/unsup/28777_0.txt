Let me begin by stating that I loved Psyclops and Arachnia and viewed those before I watched this poor exercise in film-making. Piper used brilliant clay-mation effects in the two previously stated films but here, I'm certain it has a lot to do with Shock-o-Rama Cinema, none of the fun and creative effects are prevalent. He just uses the same old worn out CGI that everyone else and their dog employs.<br /><br />Apparently Shock-o-Rama is an affiliate of Seduction Cinema, and judging by the catalog included in the DVD that I purchased, they specialize in making erotic lampoons of A-List movies; what with titles like Playmate of the Apes and The Erotic Time Machine. Therefore Shock-o-Rame places less emphasis on the SHOCK and more on the O.<br /><br />Granted this isn't much of a horror movie as Piper wasn't allowed to showcase his genius like Edgewood Studios allows him to, but this isn't a terrible movie; believe me, I've seen worse.<br /><br />VIOLENCE: $$$ (Plenty of violence and gore to sustain the viewership of horror hounds as Rob Monkiewicz packs a pistol and we get to see an exploding head, which was actually handled well).<br /><br />NUDITY: $$$$$ (Seduction Cinema couldn't allow their fright film satellite to take it easy in the nudity department. Misty Mundae, who appears to be a favorite of Seduction Cinema, spends a great deal of the film nude. Another "actress" takes the patented horror film shower scene while she talks with an "artist." Her acting skills are laughable but she is really the only cast member who lacks talent).<br /><br />STORY: $$$ (The plot is there but the dialogue leaves you wanting at times. There are moments where Piper makes strong statements on gender issues but his messages get lost in the poor production values and Shock-o-Rama's accent on skin. Although the plot of people entering a haunted house has mileage, Piper gives us a new twist with the deviant and sexually frustrated "artist" and his desire to take photos of the three models in submissive roles).<br /><br />ACTING: $$ (Nothing special here although Misty Mundae isn't nearly as bad of a thespian as I was expecting. She could be a decent actress even without removing her clothes. Rob Monkiewicz, who has been in other Piper films, gives the best performance and the guy who played the twisted photographer wasn't bad but a tad too stiff. Rachael Robbins does an adequate job in her mother-hen role).
