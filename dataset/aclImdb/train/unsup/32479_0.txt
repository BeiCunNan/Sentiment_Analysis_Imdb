Female Yakuza Tale is my first foray into "Pinky Violence". The closest thing I have ever seen to this wild Japanese take on the sexploitation sub-genre was Lady Snowblood and I can say that in comparison it hardly counts. The tale involves Ocho, a female yakuza member, who is ensnared (or en-"snatched" perhaps) in a plot to smuggle heroin using the wonders of the female anatomy. Then there is this subplot about a guy who was sent to prison and it cost him his right to be boss of the Ogi family. It really doesn't matter so much. Most of the plot is inconsequential and is really a catalyst for more carnal pleasures... Characters have the usual undeveloped back story elements that one expects from a poorly written film that serve only to frustrate the audience. These elements are handled with little care and are jarring, obnoxious and clich√©d interruptions. As a young male the only reason to sit through this flick is for the copious amounts of female flesh. One only has to go so far as the opening credits to be rewarded with the nude splendor of the star Reiko Ike. There is plenty more where that came from, rest assured that if you see an attractive woman on screen you will find out what she is hiding behind her clothing. This film makes a rule of this concept, in fact the finale has almost the entire female cast engaged in combat with only their shoes on. Blood, breasts and posterior... Too bad the camera work is static and boring and coupled with the editing makes the combat painfully staged and slow. Basically this is a film to watch if you crave a low brow cinematic fix. You watch FYT for the same reason you watch Cannibal Holocaust or a Troma flick, you crave the assault on good taste and art in favor of having primal desires satiated. While I got a kick out of this it is by no means a good film and a four star rating is all I can bear to give this.
