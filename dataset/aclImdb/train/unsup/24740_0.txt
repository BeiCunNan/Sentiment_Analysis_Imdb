Babenco has managed to put the brilliant, powerful, tough yet tender Brazilian best-seller by Drauzio Varella into a movie that must have been very difficult to shoot but that was handled firmly, with courage, great care and talent. Excellent music and some outstanding performances, with special mention to Rodrigo Santoro and Maria Luisa Mendonca.
