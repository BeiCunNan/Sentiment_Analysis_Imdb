This autobiographical character study of real-life New York City detective Eddie Egan, who also served as technical adviser for the film, is definitely underrated. Robert Duvall gives a convincing performance as Eddie Ryan, who suspended from the force after killing a drug runner. That still doesn't stop him from cleaning the streets up from gangs and other lowlife scum. The production values are surprisingly good for a little-known movie, it includes a lengthy car chase in which Duvall commandeers a city bus to evade bad guys driving all sorts of vehicles. I was lucky to have taped this onto DVD-R from Turner Classic Movies, since it probably won't be released on DVD anytime soon.
