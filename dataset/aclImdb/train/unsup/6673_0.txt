At first I was engrossed by the first minutes of the film. But having analysed the narrative structure and I came to the conclusion that in fact the beginning of the film is the vital part of the film which makes up the middle and the end of the film. There is a psychoanalytical perspective to take into consideration. One has to take into consideration the Latin American culture and the role of the man, to understand the pressures that revolve around the main character's psyche. The burden of his actions, both in having kidnapped a child and the consequences of his infidelity. This film at first seemed boring and slow, but once reflected upon can be added a few extra points. Aesthetics and psychological analysis within the narrative are strong points to look into...but didn't love it...But please bare in mind this is not a Porn film as supposedly wished in the previous critique.
