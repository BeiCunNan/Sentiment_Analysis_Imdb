Jason's Lyric is a truly great love story with a superb cast. The performances by Bokeem Woodbine as Josh, and Forest Whitaker as MadDog are strong and convincing. Complemented by a superb soundtrack, this movie should not be missed. Jason's Lyric should have received more theatrical exposure letting the main actors and supporting cast shine.
