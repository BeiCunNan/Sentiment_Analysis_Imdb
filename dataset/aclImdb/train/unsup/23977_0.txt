Mark Dacascos became one of my favourite action stars after I watched this movie, but then unfortunately no other film with him in was any good (much like Rutger Hauer - see Bladerunner and Split Second).<br /><br />So anyway, the story is just right for this type of movie - they set up the plot: Mark Dacascos on the run from the Chinese government 'coz he's got a prototype bio-engine in his body that increases the flow of adrenaline or something ("A fire engine?"); he meets Malik Brody, a loser-wannabe-musician, and kidnaps him and his old car ("This ain't the Batmobile, it's an old car") so he can get to some other guys who'll pay him a million bucks to remove it.<br /><br />And then it's just all action, baby!<br /><br />Two low-lifes (who steal the show) chase him down but are unsuccessful; so the Chinese bad guys send a newer model bio-engine experiment to beat the crap out of him.<br /><br />They drive, meet Brittany Murphy in an empty motel, Mark sings karaoke badly.<br /><br />The new guy is hard, but eventually Mark Dacascos, through sheer willpower and thirst for freedom, defeats the baddie when the guy's heart overloads and kills him.<br /><br />The story is such a perfect vehicle for the absolutely incredible martial arts action. If Mark Dacascos had played his cards right he'd be where Jet Li is right now. The one-liners are brilliant, and the bad guys are two of the most eccentric characters since the Bond movie henchmen Oddjob and Jaws (see the amazing genius frog?!?)<br /><br />P.s. The DVD has commentary with the two lead actors and the fight coordinator which is almost better than the movie itself.
