Enjoyable film, though more like a play, examining relationships between two married couples. Scores highly with me for an excellent script. The main players give full-blooded self-indulgent and self centred performances. One message from the movie is, if you want to make a marriage,it takes hard work; more importantly the film suggests some of us are not suited for that institution. I thought the ending was a bit too cosy, but on the whole the writing and directing gives this film an 8 out of 10 from me.
