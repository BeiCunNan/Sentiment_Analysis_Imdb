I hate to say anything bad about a film like this, but when there are so many similar films and I have seen a lot of them, it's easily to make comparisons and nit-pick. Let me say, first of all, that I am not complaining about this film. "My Favorite Wife" is easily enjoyable, with a well-written plot that is engaging from the beginning. It's funny, and like all great romance films, there is real emotion here. It involves Cary Grant finding his wife, whom he thought was dead after a shipwreck, seven years after the incident alive and well. Trouble is, he is remarried and he believes she is in love with a man she met on the island. It's all screwball fun and somewhat touching as their romance is rekindled and their children discover their mother for the first time. It has a similar feel to most other Cary Grant films ("The Awful Truth," etc). Irene Dunne plays Grant's wife as well here as she did in that film. The ending of the film seemed a little out of place and took a bit too long to wrap up. This came close to ruining the film for me emotionally. Despite that, if you're looking for some clean, easily-likable comedy, this is for you. Not the best of it's kind, but still entertaining.<br /><br />*** out of ****
