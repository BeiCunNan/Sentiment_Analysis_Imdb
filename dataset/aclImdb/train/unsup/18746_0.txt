Well first off i would like to say that this film was a beautiful display of genres. They way all three Asian directors captured light shadow and color was like looking at visual poetry. I felt all directors had their own take on how horror or drama and comedy should be portrayed and they brought it out very well. The biggest surprise in this movie to me is that the most violent and gruesome of directors Takashi Miike didn't display ultra images of violence, he didn't go over the top to try and gross the audience out he just stuck to the twist and turns of the story and he created a pretty usual short of his nightmarish ballad. The other two Fruit Chan and Chan-wook Park made there short highly grotesque with images of bloody infants and disturbing dissections of body parts. Therefore this film only went extremes with two directors not all three. In conclusion i felt it deserved an eight because of its acting, Cinematography, Direction and the conceptual aspects. Go see this film its amazing.
