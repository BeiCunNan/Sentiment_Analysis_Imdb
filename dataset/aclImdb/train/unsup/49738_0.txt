This movie ranks in the worst of the worst. While the fun in slasher films often lies in their inherent stupidity, Camp Slaughter takes it to an entirely new level.<br /><br />The actors must not have shown up for the filming of this movie, and been replaced by extras who had never acted before. They make Junior High drama class drop outs look like Oscar winners.<br /><br />Speaking of Junior High, the script reads like a pre-adolescent's English homework after seeing the major slasher movies. Its a patchwork of movies, borrowing entire scenes and themes, with no regard to their contexts or relevance. Bad dialogue, overblown and unrealistic uses of vice (drugs, sex, alcohol, etc.), no suspense build-up, and an anti-climactic ending. I wouldn't give this script a passing grade at any level.<br /><br />In the end, when it comes to slasher flicks, while Scream proved imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Camp Slaughter shows that imitation isn't far from ridicule, and this movie can only be summed up with that one word: ridiculous.
