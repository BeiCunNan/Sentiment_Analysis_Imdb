great movie,great music and fantastic direction.it is not possible for any directors to direct such a story with heart touching scenes.even the one who hates love will have a thought of doing love if he/she watches this movie.it is very hard for everyone to believe that this is the first movie for both hero and heroine.they played such an attracting role.songs like "OH PRIYA","OM NAMAGA",OH PAPA LAALI" make to watch this movie repeatedly.the movie's story is simple but the way of direction and cinematography makes us to love this movie.this is one of the biggest hit for the director in all major languages in India.definitely a must watch movie for all ages.
