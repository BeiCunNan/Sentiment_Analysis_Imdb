This movie originally came out in 1985. It was one of Cynthia's first roles. The re-release of this movie has Cynthia Rothrock as the headline star. Now, if it were true, then the movie would have been better, but you only see about 3 minutes of her in the whole movie. She is suppose to be the ninja who gains revenge on the drug lord and his henchmen for killing her husband. You see her in the very beginning and then through a series of flashbacks to the beginning scenes, but the the ninja is NOT her. They used some double and kept her face covered for the whole movie. I felt I was watching Game of Death. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone! Rating 1/10
