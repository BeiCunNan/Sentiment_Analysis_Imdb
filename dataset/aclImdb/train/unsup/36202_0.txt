they would have realized that the the murders were all in his head!!!!!!!!!!!! he was an "American" psycho...a fraud...a tacky, tacky fraud, as most people were in the 80's...as being the purpose of this book...to comment on the American condition during that time(and in my opinion it is still mostly apt) thus negating the premise of this entire movie...unless your an idiot and completely missed the point of either the book or the movie...then the movie will still suck!!!!!!!!!!!! i still can't believe when business in America count on American stupidity...they win...because it's true...how could anybody misinterpret such a concise ending...how exactly do you feed a kitten to an atm anyway...arrrrgghhhh. read a book!!!!!!!!! (note IMDb would not let me format this comment as i wished so imagine this all in caps and i'm shouting in outrage)
