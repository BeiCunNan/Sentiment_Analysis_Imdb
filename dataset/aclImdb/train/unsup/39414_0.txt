This is truly one of the worst films ever made. The characters were pitiable and the entire movie was a connection of cliches and formula subplots. The one memorable scene in the movie wasn't even that funny. My wife and I really felt ripped off. Since I'd MUCH PREFER to see "Plan 9 From Outer Space", voted by many as the worst movie ever, this should be dead last!!<br /><br />
