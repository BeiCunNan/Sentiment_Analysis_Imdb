I just bought Drive-in Cult Classics at Best Buy today and quickly put in Cindy and Donna after reading what this movie was about, hey I'm a guy and it sounded great!!! After watching this appalling heap of 70's garbage I realized that this T&A movie needed something else.........to be buried and NEVER watched again!!!!! I thought all I needed in a movie was an ample supply of booze, boobs and drugs but I was SO wrong!!! I do have to say that I loved the ending!!! It was so sudden and unexpected. I hope that the rest of the flicks on this set are better than this one. I am giving this 70's sexploitation flick a two for 2 BIG obvious reasons.
