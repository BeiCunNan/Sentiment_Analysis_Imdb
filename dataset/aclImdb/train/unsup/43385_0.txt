Sorry, guys, I'm just not feeling anything coming from this series as it goes on. Whereas the first two installments had a personal feeling, like the filmmakers had left their personal signature proudly on their excellent work, PART 3 and this one are obviously done to make money and nothing else.<br /><br />There are a few good things about this sequel, though: I liked seeing Crispin Glover, who is always interesting, and Corey Feldman is pretty cool until the last 20 minutes, where he annoys the hell outta me. Once again, a group of horny teenagers travel to a lake (is it even Camp Crystal Lake? we never know!) for a vacation and get killed by Jason, the supernatural killer who seems to survive everything and get stronger in every sequel. Here, he's like Superman, which is a little too much for my tastes. Sort of like how Michael Myers became a walking muscleman in HALLOWEEN 4-6. The only noteworthy acting kudos go to Glover and Feldman, everyone else can be forgotten. The final girl, Trish, does not pack a wallop and once again, there is no character development. While the horny teens are more likable this time around, they're not that much more likable. Good gore scenes, though, done by Tom Savini.<br /><br />FINAL CHAPTER holds several very good scenes that stand with the best of the series and does create an atmosphere that was notably missing from PART 3, but is still pretty bad. What's worse is that money forced this "final installment" to be evidence that horror is the most untrustworthy genre when it comes to pleasing the viewer. I still wholeheartedly recommend PART 2 as the best of the series.
