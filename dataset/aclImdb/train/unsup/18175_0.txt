"The Dunwich Horror" is the second H.P.Lovecraft adaptation from art director Daniel Haller("Die,Monster,Die!")is actually another flawed attempt to capture the unimaginable darkness of Lovecraft's literature on film.Sandra Dee plays Nancy Walker,a young college student who is lured into the mysterious house of Whateley by the creepy young warlock Wilbur Whateley(Dean Stockwell).The local community has long suspected that the whole Whateley family-Wilbur,his grandfather(Sam Jaffe),and his mother,who is in an insane asylum-is unholy,and soon their suspicions are confirmed.Wilbur intends to use Nancy as a human sexual sacrifice that will unleash dark powers-represented by his monstrous twin brother,who exists in another dimension-across the earth.Occult professor Dr.Armitage(Ed Begley)discovers what Wilbur's up to,and with the aid of Nancy's roommate (Donna Baccala),he tries to stop it."The Dunwich Horror" is a psychedelic little horror film that offers some interesting visuals.The film is slow-paced and there is absolutely no gore.It relies more on suggestion than shocks,so if you like old-fashioned horror give it a look.7 out of 10.
