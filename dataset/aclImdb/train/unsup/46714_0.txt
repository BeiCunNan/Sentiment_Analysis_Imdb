This movie was, quite frankly, crap. Artsy, pretentious crap, to be fair, but crap nevertheless. Only see it if you're into post-apocalyptic films of the worst kind/are a die-hard Rocky Horror fan/ have very low standards. There wasn't much of a plot, and what was there was entirely too hard to follow amidst the seizure-inducing color scheme of the movie and it's poor acting.<br /><br />If you still wish to see this movie, however, just fast forward to the Brittania dance-sequence. It's totally worth the $3.50 you'll pay renting it from anywhere, and has more poignant acting and plot than any other section of the entire film. And be sure to turn off the movie during the Little Nell smothering sex-scene.
