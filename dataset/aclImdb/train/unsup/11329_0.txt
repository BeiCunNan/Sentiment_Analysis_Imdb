I'm somewhat familiar with DND and RP'ing in general. I even LARP'd in high school. I really enjoyed this film. I actually felt like I was watching a DND campaign come to life! I wasn't expecting cinematic genius here, just a decent adventure, and this movie delivers. It's almost like reading a fantasy short story.<br /><br />I also watched the special features beforehand. It really helped to see how passionate the people were and how much they respected DND. It seems like a good bunch of people that just wants the audience to have fun.<br /><br />I honestly think that anyone who complains about CGI not being good enough or how "cheesy" it was, is too young to give intelligent critiques. This is a bunch of hard working, unfamous British actors in Lithuania trying to entertain you for 105 minutes. Honestly, I really appreciate the effort they put in.
