Tenko is a series I first watched at the tender age of 13 years back in 1981. From the word go it gripped. The acting is supreme: Ann Bell, Stephanie Cole, Stephanie Beacham are tremendous. The viewer lives and breaths the ordeal of the characters in a way that no other TV series has ever managed. It is head and shoulders clear of the rest. Having purchased the full DVD set, including reunion, a handful of years ago I am shortly to embark on my tenth viewing of the run.<br /><br />I was sorry to have missed Paul O'Grady's 25 year celebration in October 2007. I can't believe that the cast are now approaching 70. It makes me feel old and long for the days before reality TV ruled when good drama and sitcoms proliferated.
