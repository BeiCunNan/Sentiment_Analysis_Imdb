After being introduced to this series shortly after it came out I've taped this and shown the entire series to two women, who also loved it.<br /><br />Of course this was a natural for me after studying Latin for five years (but classical Latin literature pretty much ends with Virgil and the early Augustan age)<br /><br />I'm not one who normally notices good acting, only bad acting, but Jacobi (and, really, the entire cast) was brilliant.<br /><br />Sian Phillips is a portrait of pure evil<br /><br />A gripping tale that will engage you to the end. The worst that can be said of this is that it is a classy soap opera.<br /><br />Read the books!
