a bounty hunter(Rutger Hauer)takes on a terrorist(Gene Simmons).while it's refreshing to see Hauer in a non bad guy role,there's not much else to recommend this movie. found it boring and tedious from the get go,right to the final credits.Robert Guillaume is also in the movie and is good,as always,but he is wasted here.Garey Sherman directed the movie.he also directed Poltergeist III and wrote several episodes of the TV series Poltergeist:The Legacy and he co-wrote Wanted:dead or Alive with Michael Patrick Goodman.i wanted to like this movie,but it just doesn't have much going for it in the originality or action and excitement dept.the most i can give Wanted:Dead or Alive is a 4/10
