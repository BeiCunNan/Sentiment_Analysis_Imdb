I saw this movie when it came out in 1979 (ironically at the same drive-in theater I managed in 1990) and it scared the daylights out of me then, and it still creeps me out today! The plot is simple, the tall man is robbing graves, and making dwarf slaves out of the bodies, and it's up to Mike, Jody, and Reggie to stop him! This is the best installment of the series, and there isn't too much gore in this one. The possible exception is when the ball kills the care taker, but that is pretty mild by today's standards, so I wouldn't recommend it to little kids, or the faint of heart. The tall man ranks as a true classic horror character, along with Dracula, and Freddie Kruger. Angus Scrimm is the modern day Bela Lugosi in the respect we will remember him for scaring the pants off of us by playing a true horror villain!!
