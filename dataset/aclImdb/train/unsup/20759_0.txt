This film was touted to be a Documentary concerning Orlando Gays Days, the Gay Community in Orlando and Big Business. Having viewed this film (wish I hadn't), I didn't come away with anything the documentary's name "Selling Queer" stated , except for one very short, very quick comment in the entire film. The comment was fast and was hard to find through all the choppy confusion. Selling Queer had absolutely no cohesiveness of structure, content and purpose. Sorry, it did have a purpose. The purpose was for some director(?) to make a quick buck off Homosexuality.<br /><br />Renting or even seeing for free, Selling Queer would not be worth the effort. You would do better to burn the money in you wallet or purse rather than wasting it on this film.
