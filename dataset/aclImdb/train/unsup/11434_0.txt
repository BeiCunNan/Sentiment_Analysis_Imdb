Okay, this one was 11 minutes less than 3 hours, but if you include the trailers etc. beforehand it's 3 hours plus. It felt like an eternity to watch.<br /><br />It's a doc about the repetitive daily lives of European monks who have taken a vow of silence. That's it. Almost three hours of it. They should show it to prisoners as a form of psychological torment.<br /><br />When the camera is pointed at the faces of individual monks I wanted to scream: "Where's the narration?!! Sure, you show us their daily routines but what about some analysis?"-- I wanted to leave before it was finished. Total asceticism doesn't translate as a film-able or interesting subject.
