All the best intentions went into this project. It has everything we've come to expect from the epic fantasy category: a young hero finding his destiny, a tyrannical evil which must be brought down, a secret magic that could save or destroy the world. It even has one of those unexpected cameos that can make a picture amusing and informative. So what's wrong? The entire project seems to be handled in a very heavy-handed manner. Long expository passages of dialogue, overblown characterizations and some truly terrible acting. Even David Warner is bad, and I like David Warner. For any one who thinks they might wish to see this film, I advise the MST3K version, or better yet, don't watch it at all.
