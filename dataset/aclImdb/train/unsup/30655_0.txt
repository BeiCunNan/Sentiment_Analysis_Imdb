This is definitely my favourite of all of Paul Hogan's films. I remember watching this back when i was younger and i loved it. The whole story about a bank robber who finds his calling in a much different sector of the spectrum made it an entertaining film. The acting is superb by the three main characters which really helps flesh out this story to the point that you really care for the characters. Paul Hogan plays a likable con turned good guy, his real life wife Linda Kozlowski plays a church/charity worker for disadvantaged kids who has a heart of gold and lastly kudos to Elias Koteas whose portrayal of a disabled guy gives the movie the heart and emotion that I must say I didn't expect. All in all almost an angel is a great little movie with some surprises
