chicken little is not that a good film it has animals pretending to be human and the plot of the sky falling down was not really good i think when they make a animated film with animals just use them as as true to life as they get like a talking parrot that helps people not like a fish with a helmet full of water how would the rest of his body coup with the surroundings. the next film coming that i have heard of is "cars"with little cars that can talk and can controls themselves if you can believe this you can believe a lot of things. chicken little has some good things about it like the comedy and the way it makes you feel like that you feel sorry for a chicken.
