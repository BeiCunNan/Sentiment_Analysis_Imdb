I started to watch Grizzly Rage (titled Off Road in TV guide) on TV last night but it was so bad I had to turn it off after 30 minutes. The plot was paper thin, the characters unbelievable. Four graduates head "off road" and kill a bear cub in a restricted area. When the mother bear begins to stalk them, they start doing the dumbest things - (1) two of them head off in different directions - alone! - to look for water for their overheated vehicle engine (2) with one guy already killed by the bear, a second guy goes wacky inside the car and causes the driver to go over an embankment! It's just the type of movie that gives Canadian films a bad reputation...
