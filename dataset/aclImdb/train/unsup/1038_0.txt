I don't know if it was intentional or not, but I, and most of the audience laughed at this one all the way through. The suicidal kid reminded me of one of my exes. I think people have judged this film a bit too harshly for what it is. <br /><br />It plays out almost like a mockumentary. I would say if you liked The School of Rock, this is its bastard cousin, filled with profanity and a guy who starts screaming and then says he needs more coffee. I have to praise the editor for linking those bits together. <br /><br />I got into this movie for free, so I would say if you have the means to get into the movie for free, you should. It is definitely an eye opener.
