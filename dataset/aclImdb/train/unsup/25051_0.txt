This is a great film. A really original screen play and a solid independent comedy. The film takes place in suburban LA and it focuses on billiard store owner Zack who frets between his ex-girlfriend Jen and the sex life of an active bachelor. His girlfriend wants to organize a threesome to prove to Zack that she can be the woman of his fantasies. Zack has sidekick is his buddy David. A guy who idolizes Hugh Hefner. The film is filled with wacky but well thought out characters including a hilarious angry midget and a gun wielding psychiatrist. I laughed all the way through and was really amazed at the production quality of this indie comedy. It was funnier than almost any studio comedy I saw this year. Vince Rocca has a truly original movie here and I can't wait to see what he does next.
