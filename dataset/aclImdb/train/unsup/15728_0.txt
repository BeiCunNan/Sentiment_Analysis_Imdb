I really enjoyed this docu - was thought provoking and gut wrenchingly sad. I haven't seen Monster but I did watch Nick's original, so go out and watch that first, then sit back and be shocked, horrified, touched etc.. at this final chapter in the life of someone who did not deserve the life she had.<br /><br />I hope Jeb Bush watches this, I don't know how he can sleep at night - the karma police are going to catch you up.<br /><br />What a tragic tale.
