This thing is not worth downloading.<br /><br />This movie urinates all over the canon of the Street Fighter series of games. Makes no sense. Contains one massive idiot plot (that actually involves the director RIPPING OFF HIS OWN FILMS, Romeo Must Die! No one even comes close to looking like they should. And if your movie title contains the words "Street" and "Fighter" in them, it behooves you to have them... at some point... Fighting. Preferably, in a Street. Not running around dockside with machineguns like in a Lethal Weapon flick.<br /><br />Kristen Kreuk managed to turn in the least sexy fighting heroine ever. She managed to make possibly the lamest all-girl dance scene ever committed to film. And I'm counting 1938's Sex Madness in the list. She manages to dance whiter than Jimmy Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life. I'd have appreciated someone falling into a pool at some point in this flick.<br /><br />Raul Julia actually brought an enjoyable panache to the role of M. Bison. And he had black hair. And was a snappy dresser. And killed Chun Li's father on a Tuesday. OF COURSE!! <br /><br />They managed to take a cool video game, and in the process of making the movie, extract every single thing that made it cool. Vega should not wear a shirt, Gen should be a deceptively frail old martial arts master, Cammy should be... somewhere in there.
