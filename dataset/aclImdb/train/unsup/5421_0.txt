The scenes that ostensibly advance the "plot" are few an far between; punctuated by a jumbled mess of mock-documentary confessional scenes. The documentary segments might have been somewhat interesting, if only for their multi-national take on a common theme, except for the fact that they were edited in such a way as to jump from person to person within a topic, then back again, in no apparent order. The effect was to make it seem as though the director was attempting to s-t-r-e-t-c-h limited footage to take up more time. Not necessary, as it turned out, because the film seemed twice as long as it actually is.<br /><br />The big question here is whether the direction or editing is worse. I suppose the direction appears worse due to choppy editing; the editing was probably worsened by horrible direction.<br /><br />It is unfair to judge the acting ability of either Daryl Hannah or Denise Richards based upon this film. Questioning their judgment (or desperation?) in appearing in this mess of a film is another story entirely!
