When i heard of this movie, it was very promising,like Bangkok dangerous or sort of.But hell no.The movie begins confusing and you actually don't get the right idea of the characters.The the plot goes even more confusing at the concert and keeps it's way of lame events all the way to the end.The boss-fight at the end is total OMG the collateral dmg guy was supposed to use some kind of sharp weapon not a kung fu pan.For those who don't know there are a lot of way cooler weapons in kung fu.By the way i've always thought that the evil mean guy in any movie shouldn't do kung fu, because it's kinda a defensive matrial art and it's philosophy is quite calming and purifying and he is a f**king psycho.The ending is lame as expected.I was expecting some kind of Big Hit ending where "main" hero was supposed to grab the girl after dealing with the mean dude, but no the makers of this had better idea:she keeps on singing some sappy pop-trash and he is somewhere.Rofl really... If after all this you've red you still want to watch the movie better rent it from some tormented soul
