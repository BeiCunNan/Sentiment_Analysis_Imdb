Evil Dead II once again sees Ash (Bruce Campbell) battling the evil demons in a run down cabin in the woods with his teenage friends. Its the centrepiece of the Evil Dead Trilogy and yet it feels a little like a remake of the original, it does follow on from the events of the first film but the similarities between the two are very apparent.<br /><br />Once again there is plenty of horror, gore and chills; but this time there is even more humour than in the first outing, and once again it is a great film.<br /><br />The character of Ash and the direction of Raimi combine well again and this time the effects have improved a little too.<br /><br />7/10 I still prefer the first film, but in truth they are about as good as each other.
