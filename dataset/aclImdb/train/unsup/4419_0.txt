"Phantasm" is a way to go to end the 70's era. Before Jason Voorhes, before Freddy Kreuger, or even the Candyman, there's The Tall Man(Angus Scrimm), a hauntingly tower of terror who uses a the deadliest arsenals of all: The Flying Silver Spheres! The fun fact is the Plymouth HemiCuda is a rad car back then, and still is now. A young man meets this sinister man and sees how he handled the coffins. His older brother one time makes out with this mysterious blonde and he freak when he sees one of the Tall Man's minions running around the graveyard. Then there's the scene where he was is the coffin and he blows out the left rear tire from inside. If he shot the middle he would have been blown sky high. Fighting the Tall Man is challenging, knowing his weakness is even more challenging. Reggie(Reggie Banister) remembered that the Tall Man can't stand cold. He worked as a Ice Cream salesman, and he's also a warrior at heart. Great horror movie, I like it! 4 out of 5 stars!
