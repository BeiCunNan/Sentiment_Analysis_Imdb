I watched this movie with the English subtitles, and found it to be a pleasant, if disjointed, Brazilian comedy. The translation was fairly good, but if you are fluent in Portuguese you'll notice several goofs in translation. The plot of God taking a vacation has been done before and I'm sure that it will be done again. But God taking a vacation in poor, but scenic Northeastern Brazil has not been done and could not be done anywhere else and look as eye-catchingly beautiful. The only thing missing is a side trip to the island of Fernando de Noronha.<br /><br />See this for the enjoyment of touring a most beautiful and scenic part of the world on the cheap !!!
