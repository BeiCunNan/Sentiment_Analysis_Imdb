For those old enough to remember, CONTROL is Michael Crichton's TERMINAL MAN turned on its head. Convicted murderer Ray Liotta becomes the subject of a secret experiment to turn this vicious, unrepentant killer into a civilized pussycat. After taking an experimental medication and undergoing behavior modification, he is mainstreamed with a new identity. All too predictably, enemies from his past track the "new" man down and the chase is on. Liotta is the only reason for watching this horse puckey. He goes from a snarling, foul-mouthed beast to a real sweetie, albeit one with a hidden agenda that is revealed much too soon (see the film). Willem Dafoe as the mad scientist and Michelle Rodriguez as Liotta's new love interest are completely and utterly wasted. Sad, because it starts out with a bang when the prison fakes Liotta's execution and he is then transported to Dafoe's lab to begin his transformation. From the moment Liotta is mainstreamed, the film simply falls apart and becomes just another muddleheaded and improbable B-level thriller.
