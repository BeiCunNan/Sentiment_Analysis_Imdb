WOSAT, as it is known to its loyal fans, is one of the greatest movies ever made. It's charming, it's funny, the special effects will stand up against the test of time, and it's a true hero's journey - the Green Wizard overcomes the challenges and wins the heart of the pretty girl, as well as defeating the bad guy.<br /><br />It's a shame that it didn't turn out that way in real life for Mike Jittlov. He is a genuinely talented person who deserved better than he got from his business partner, who played the evil producer in the movie and who also screwed Mike over royally on the movie.<br /><br />Buy this movie. Visit alt.fan.mike-jittlov and tell Mike how much you loved it. Send him money. We need more Wizard Work in this world!
