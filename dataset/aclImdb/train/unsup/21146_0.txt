The low rating of the movie may be misleading, the demographic show that this is a love it or hate it movie. 10 got the most votes, but lots of other votes from 1 to 9. The average is actually 6, only the weighted average pulls it down to 4. If you like slapstick comedies, I can only suggest you run see this movie. I'd rate it as one of the most funniest I've ever seen. The movie certainly lacks any sort of plot and is very chaotic. Its more a collection of Jerry Lewis thrown from one funny scene, into the other. To give an example: In one scene he tries to commit suicide by driving off a hill out in the middle of nowhere. The car gets stuck right at the edge and won't budge. So Jerry gets out, opens the trunk, and pours petrol all over him. Then he frantically looks for matches, only to realise he doesn't have any. If you can picture Jerry's face and body language throughout the whole seen and find that funny, you should really see this movie. I won't describe anymore scenes, as with every slapstick comedy, once you know the gag it's not as funny anymore. However, if you need a good plot and can't laugh out loud at slapstick comedies, you should maybe pass on that one. Or get yourself a better sense of humour...
