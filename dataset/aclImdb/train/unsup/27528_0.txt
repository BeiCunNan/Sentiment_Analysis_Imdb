I no longer live in Florida, having decided to move to California after the death of my long-time companion/partner -- a life altering event. Having never heard about or seen this movie before, I wish Bill could have viewed this film before he left me! We were pre-Stonewall (I am now in my 80's)and, in fact, living just around the corner from The Stonewall in the NYC Village on the night of that famous explosive event -- another life altering event. A Very Natural Thing is an amazing film that everyone (gay or straight) should (must?)see. It tells a simple story in a very simple manner: expressive of a time when gay men and women were watchful and fearful of exposure. I confess tears streamed down my face -- partially because of the beauty of the film and partially grieving for lost youth. I hope younger homosexuals will not disparage the old-fashion-ness or the lack of modern day cinematic sophistication of this outstanding piece of film work: indeed a thing of beauty and a joy forever.
