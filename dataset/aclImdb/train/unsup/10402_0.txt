This is a great movie....the movie keeps you on yur feet the whole way!<br /><br />It's about Arnie and his troops....heading into the jungle to rescue some hostages....well turns out they have something that is hunting them...a alien that likes to hunt and collect skulls as trophies. Great cast...Arnie, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Sonny Landham, Richard Chaves. The special effects in this film as awesome and the Predator played by Kevin Peter Hall....he was pretty darn scary looking....Great action, great cast, awesome movie!!! I give this movie 4 stars ****!!!!!!!!!!!
