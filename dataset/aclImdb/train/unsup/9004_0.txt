with a few plot changes, but that's understandable, I mean, they can't go exactly from the book, word for word, because there are some things in books that just can' be put on screen.<br /><br />I don't get why people don't like this movie so much, I mean, THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!!!! The whole idea of a City of Ember is very believable.<br /><br />You can tell they used every cent of their 55 million dollar budget, because, jeez, the sets are fantastically real, the costumes look authentic! The part of the boats actually being the lockers was genius. I never saw it coming. It was a little easier I bet for the filmmakers to film a moving turnstile than a cave against the rushing water. ;)<br /><br />Love this title, go see it while it is on DVD, because (sadly) it did not do well at all in the box office, so probably no adaptation of "People of Sparks" :(
