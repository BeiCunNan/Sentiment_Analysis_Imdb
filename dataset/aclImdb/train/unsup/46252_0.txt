Being a longtime mystery lover, but never having read Robert B. Parker or seen a Jesse Stone movie, I really looked forward to watching Sea Change. But it was almost a complete disappointment. First, the principal characters have been given colorful histories or eccentricities seemingly only to keep them from being completely uninteresting otherwise or to fill time (for example, Luthor's post-coma extrasensory power). Why does anyone have his or her peculiarities? And how do they add to the plot? Why is Sean Young's character even introduced? Nothing is ever developed or explained. Second, no problem is ever too great for Jesse to wrap up neatly with almost no effort, including the rape charge, the problem with Fish, and even the central mystery. Even William Devane, who is always worth watching, is unlikely as an ex-cop-turned-psychiatrist. And the glacial pace of this drama makes it almost painful to sit through. I know there are a lot of Robert B. Parker fans out there, but I can't see how this movie could possibly justify their devotion.
