The writer has taken a good plot and completely messed it up. The dialogue between the two lead teen characters seems completely unrealistic and god help anyone that has to watch any other film starring the posh kid. He just can't act. This film was totally un-gripping, the relationship between the audience and the characters didn't exist. Anyone who likes space movies should see this film, it's completely lacking in atmosphere. The real question you will ask yourself at the end of the film is whether you should commit suicide for enduring this ****.
