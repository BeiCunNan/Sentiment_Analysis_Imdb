There are many, many better Christmas movies out there to watch than this one. Mickey Rooney plays Mike Halligan, a retired New York City detective who dies before Christmas and is sent back to Earth to find an alcoholic angel and sober him up in time for Christmas to spread the Christmas cheer to the citizens of New York. Along the way, the retired detective kidnaps his grandson and is supposed to show him a real New York Christmas. The trouble is, there is nothing very Christmassy about death or New York City with no Christmas lights or decorations. Obviously filmed during the summer, this movie has no feeling for Christmas whatsoever. Scott Grimes, who plays the grandson, is a lousy actor for a kid, he can only portray a chipper, bright-eyed sparrow on the screen even when the scene calls for a deeper, emotional moment. Lots of sub-par acting and virtually no storyline make for a really bland Christmas movie that should be moving at times, but instead comes off as forced and weak. I don't understand all the high ratings for this film, it misses the mark so often and lacks any true depth of feeling in it's characters. Don't waste your time with this one, you will only be bored and disappointed I'm afraid.
