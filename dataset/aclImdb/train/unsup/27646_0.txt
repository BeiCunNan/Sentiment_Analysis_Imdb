Laughed my head off - a howling laugh riot - sexy for sure - entire cast is gorgeous, but it's so funny you don't have time to think about whatever hormones may be rushing through your body as the beautiful people parade before you - for me it says just how absurd we all are and what complications we create over nothing! Left me with a wonderful feeling at how uncomplicated my own life is and how I have managed to avoid complication by keeping things simple - also by keeping wacky people out of my life! Like all French films, this one is character-driven, something Hollywood doesn't know anything about and which distinguishes French films above all others. There is something about French films that is truly unique and this one is a perfect example of French film at its best - although I cannot think of any French film I did not like.
