I can honestly say that I'm easy to please with movies - I'll sit through a mediocre film and at least watch it to the end.<br /><br />I'll also praise and mention at least once a week movies that I love, such as fight club, the matrix, amelie and other very good movies (my opinion of course)<br /><br />This movie however I can honestly say was so bad I couldn't sit through it, the acting is nothing short of atrocious, the lines are terrible, the realism pathetic and the fact it "stole" the name from the original is actually insulting!<br /><br />The original was a fairly good movie, but this is HONESTLY a 2/10 movie - the ONLY saving merits is the fairly attractive girl who stars in it and....... i think that's about it.<br /><br />SERIOUSLY do yourself a favour and see something else - quite possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen (hell I even sat through 2 fast 2 furious and THAT blows this away!)<br /><br />Infact it's SO damn bad they could almost MST3K it!<br /><br />UGH!
