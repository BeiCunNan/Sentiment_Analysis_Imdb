I have watched CSI: Crime Scene Investigations from the start, along with a lot of other people here in Canada. It is the best show on TV with Grissom in it. If Grissom is really off the show then I won't be watching anymore and neither will my friends and millions of others who made the show #1 for so many years. He is the glue that binds it all together. This "new guy" is a joke. It looks like they tried to get a man who resembles Grissom and failed. If William Peterson is wanting to leave the show, I bet he will still be the Executive Producer and will not want to lose the millions and millions of fans of the show. Please bring Grissom back and lets get on with the best show on TV bar none!! Y. Nairn
