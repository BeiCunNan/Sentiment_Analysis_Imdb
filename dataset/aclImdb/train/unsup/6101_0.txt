This film shows exactly what don't like in Hollywood ;the real nature of sexual relationships ,that's the reason why a superb film like this never will won an Oscar.It shows the extreme passion that everybody can feel about somebody ;your life could be like one of the characters of the film , you only has to meet somebody really special , and ,If you think you never would do the things the characters of this film made ,you will instantly change your opinion , why?, because when you are absolutely in love with somebody , you would anything for that person that make you feel so good...That is the human nature. Other great true this film shows is the sad side that everybody has ;when you know you can do what you want with somebody ,you do it...This means that you make suffer that person (that has fall in love with you), only for pleasure...that is how the mankind is.
