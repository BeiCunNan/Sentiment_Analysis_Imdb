As I read some of the user comments I see people blaming Stephen King for this piece of drivel. Don't blame him. The move follows the book loosely and many details that would explain the actions of the characters are left out. While Dreamcatcher is not one of King's best books, it isn't the worst. All I could say to my wife while I was watching this was "The book was better."<br /><br />If you must blame anyone blame the screen writers who took a book with lots of internal dialog and tried to turn it into a movie. Think "Dune."<br /><br />~~~~~BOOK SPOILER~~~~~ Duddits wasn't an alien. Kurtz/Curtis was crazier. Owen was a bigger turncoat. Duddits was more developed. And a plethora of other scenes were left out.<br /><br />Once again, take this movie as you will, but don't blame King.
