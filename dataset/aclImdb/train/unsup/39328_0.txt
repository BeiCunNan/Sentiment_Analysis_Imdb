As a kid, I loved this short. I think my tolerance for Mickey's bad acting was higher (but still not all that high). It's still kind of cute in its own way, but once again, whatever "gags" are here are ruined by MGM's bad sense of pacing.<br /><br />Buckwheat tries to milk a cow just by setting glass bottles below it and standing next to it. As far as gags go, this is a far cry from "Mush and Milk" when the kids would rig a vacuum cleaner for the cow (though a lot less abusive, I will admit). In the meantime, we see Mickey get dumped into a well (yay!) and Froggy carried up by an obvious piece of wire as a mule bucks him off.<br /><br />In this short, there's also another kid named "Happy". You know, what's very odd about MGM's later shorts is that they simply could not find other kids who could act. They all dispense their lines wearily, as if making movies was the most depressing thing in their lives. Compared to some of the ancillary characters, Mickey's manic screeching is at least notable for its ENERGY.
