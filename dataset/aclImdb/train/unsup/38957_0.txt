Forget the HYPE, this movie stinks! It doesn't know which audience to play for 3 year olds or adults. It also doesn't know whether it should be campy or cartoonish. It's a jumbled mess that only did well because of the Very LARGE and VERY EXPENSIVE marketing. If you want something to keep the kids busy, spend the money on a new toy and watch the cartoon! My rating 1...HORRIBLE DESPITE HYPE!
