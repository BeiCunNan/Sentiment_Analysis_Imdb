So, THIS is the famous Sunset Blvd... and what an absolute delight it rightfully turns out to be: Captivating story of struggling screenwriter Holden who accidentally enters aging, old-time screen actress Swanson's life. Before he knows it, he is caught in her obsession of reviving her long gone-career, moving into her mansion... and more than meets the eye unfolds! A joy to watch such old - and smart - b&w (Hitchcock-stylish, indeed) Hollywood at its best, and an especially juicy box of chocolates for movie lovers and cinephiles, with all the famous real-life star faces... As much as "Singin' in the rain" a terrific movie about the film industry itself, a non-flinching self-inventory and the changing of the times pushing old stars out of the spotlight, with a truly great, moving portrait by Swanson.<br /><br />Maturely intelligent, incisive and stirringly put together with some classic scenes & dialog and an exemplary use of voice-over. It's easy to see why this triumph for writer-director legend Wilder probably is compulsory viewing for film classes! <br /><br />9 out of 10 from Ozjeppe
