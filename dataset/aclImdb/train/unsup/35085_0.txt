I've seen much worse- but at least those movies had the guts to try something new (even though they tanked doing it).<br /><br />The Terror Within is a rip-off of Alien. Similarities include (but are not limited to: a homemade flamethrower, a chest-bursting monster, lots of drool, a pair of engineers- one black, one white, an aging male captain who is somewhat heroic, a tense scene in something resembling air ducts, Creature reproduction includes humans, and a pet that is orphaned when its owner is killed.<br /><br />The most obvious ripoff is the scene when they are searching a storage room (cargo bay) for the creature. Even the camera angles and shot order are similar to Alien.<br /><br />I'd like to give this movie a 2 but there are other movies I'd give a two...and this isn't as bad as those.
