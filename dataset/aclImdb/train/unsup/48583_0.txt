One of the most slow-paced and boring movies I have ever seen. We kept watching it, waiting for something to happen. The movie kept going on and on, so I shut it off. It got to the point where I didn't want to give the movie the satisfaction of sitting through till the end. It made me crazy. The Lady Chablis character seemed reptilian and how she was portrayed as an object of desire was absurd. The film was a study in pedestrian pacing, stereotypical southern mannerisms and dialog, and a sense that the film lost its way midway through. Wasted performances by Jude Law and Kevin Spacey. John Cusak seemed blander than sodium free chicken broth. Clint Eastwood's daughter couldn't carry her role off and competes with Sophia Copola of Godfather III for the unbridled nepotism award.
