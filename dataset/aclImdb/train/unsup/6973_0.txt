Delicatessen has joined a body of work unparalleled in modern film. Both its most notable counterparts ("City Of Lost Children", and more recentantly the vivacious "Amelie") are brilliant and vibrant peices of cinema, however personally i feel that Delicatessen takes the cake. Dominique Pinon (A Jeunet regular) plays the hapless wanderer Joseph, who turns up at a rather ominous butcher shop looking for work. It is a dank, rather terrifying unspecified region of France, in a future when food is scarce and vegetarians reside below the surface like rats. What ensues is both darkly comical and touching.<br /><br />Jeunet's cinematic style is striking to say the least - the camera zooms around the recesses of the apartment block and surrounding alleyways like a hyperactive insect. Characters are bursting with life, oozing charm and wit - most notably the sinister butcher, or the Frog-man. The film is painted with deft strokes, resulting in a seamless cinematic treat, drizzled with masterful comic timing and a lot of heart.
