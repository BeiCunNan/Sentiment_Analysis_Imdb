If you liked last year's "Sometimes happy, sometimes sad", you will certainly love this new Bollywood-Hit. Located totally in New York and presenting a mix of Woody Allen's Manhattan and Saturday Night Fever, it's three hours of absolute pleasure with a heartbreaking finale (remember Love Story or Terms of endearment?).<br /><br />Indian star Shahrukh Khan does his best to bring the girl he secretly loves together with her best friend, because he's going to die. A group of wonderful actors, funny dialogues and sexy musical-numbers make this Indian love story pure joy and entertainment. Just until the end, when you can't hold back the tears any longer.
