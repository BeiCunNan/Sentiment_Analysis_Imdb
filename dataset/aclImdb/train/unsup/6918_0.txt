This is a below average movie that at best could have been an average thriller. The plot is confusing and has more holes than all the golf courses at Myrtle Beach. Britt Ekland is in a mental hospital relating her story to a psychiatrist about multiple murders on a boat.<br /><br />Her story starts as the newly weds (her and John Phillip Law, both trying to play characters 20 years younger) decide to spend their honey moon on a boat with 2 of his ex Viet Nam comrades and their sexy girlfriends. There are flashbacks of some Viet Nam war action thrown in. There are a few murders at the hospital with some one investigating the murders.<br /><br />Once on the boat people begin to get murdered one by one by what appears to be the ghost of a Viet Cong soldier. There are 2 people eventually left on the boat, Britt Ekland and a very sexy, spooky girlfriend of one of the other men. The 2 women left standing I suppose believe the other person is the murderer so Britt Ekland ends up killing her and that is the end of her story. The psychiatrist sort of says "well OK" walks away and hey its all over. <br /><br />You can watch this movie straight through without missing a second and still feel as though you walked away from it several times for 5 minutes.
