This awful movie has very little resemblance to H.G. Wells fantastic novel. I only watched this film because Pamela Franklin, whom I'm a huge fan of, was in this film. I guess she needed the money real bad to appear in a stinker like this. Director Bert I. Gordon has done some wonderful, low-budget campy films in the '50s and '60s, but this isn't one of them! Some people like this film because it is so bad and cheesy; I mean I usually get a big laugh out of films like that, but this film is a total bore. Contains a few laughs, but not many. Perhaps if I watched it stoned, I might find it funnier, because everything is funny when you are high. The very fact that former child evangelist, Marjoe Gortner is in it is enough to type anyone of that it is a very, horrible movie. I feed bad for Ms. Franklin that she even appeared in such a rotten egg of a movie. No wonder she gave up acting!
