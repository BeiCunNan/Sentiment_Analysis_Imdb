Okay, you might want to dismiss a review that claims "the worst I've ever seen", but I asked my wife to name a movie that she has seen that's worse and neither of us could come up with one...<br /><br />I've seen better acting in soap operas. There aren't words in the English language to describe how painfully horrible the acting is with the exception of Lance H. as Long John Silver.<br /><br />The story line is very poor (giant bugs???) and arranged in a way that just confuses the viewer. Characters are thrust into the story line without any previous mention. If you're not familiar with the story of Treasure Island and who the characters are, you'd undoubtedly be lost.<br /><br />Due to the terrible acting, piecemeal editing, and terrible story line, I have come to the conclusion that this movie was or was intended to be a porn.
