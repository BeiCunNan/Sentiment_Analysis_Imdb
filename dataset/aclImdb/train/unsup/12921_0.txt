I watched this film yesterday on Film 4 - I quited liked this film in some parts. Upon watching, I realised this film was really about family breakdown. You sometimes think that family problems are more of a modern thing of today - but back then they had their fair share of family upheaval, back stabbing and murder in mind.<br /><br />This film is a Gothic,atmospheric melodrama about Caroline played by a young Jean Simmons as a 16/17-year-old who goes to live with her uncle Silas (Derrick de Marney)after her father dies. Uncle Silas house is some big creepy Mansion with lots of cob webs dark corners and dungeon like stairs and rooms. While there creepy uncle Silas, his son and a french governess plot to kill Caroline and keep her inheritance. <br /><br />I though Derrick de Marney at times performance of Uncle Silas was not creepy enough, as it verged towards being comical. The french governess Madame de la Roughierre (played by Katrina Paxinau)was very creepy and sinister,especially when she takes Caroline on a journey of extreme deception. She was menacing Caroline every step of the way. Her performance made up for the loss in Derrick De Marney non evil performance. Caroline (Jean Simmons) sometimes gave a weak performance which probably was down to some weak and prissy dialogue. Sometimes I felt I could of climbed in the telly and give her a good slapping and tell her to pull herself together and be strong!!!!
