The original film made in 1981, The Howling had so much going for it that it was a great film. This entry tried to repeat with almost the same plot, different names and professions and a different outcome but it had nothing that makes it worthwhile to watch again. No humor and no sense in having the lead woman playing a writer instead of a TV reporter being helped by a dead nun? The one cute character had a very small role, the family poodle that dead. This one must be real bad if I liked the dog better than the people!
