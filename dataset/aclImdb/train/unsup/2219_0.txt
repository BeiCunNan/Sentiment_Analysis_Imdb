In the city of Suddenly, three gangsters trap the Benson family in their own house, on the top of a hill nearby the railroad station, with the intention of killing the president of the USA. <br /><br />This storyline produced a great tense and suspenseful movie, with an excellent performance of Frank Sinatra, as the chief of the bandits. It is not a long story (runtime 75 min.), therefore the viewer does not get tired, since most of the plot happens in the interior of the Benson's house. There are two very important approaches in this film: the first, of course, is president Kennedy being shot some years later. Another point is the idea of household trapped in their own home, very well explored in 'The Desperate Hours (1955)', therefore, one year later. Of course with the values of 2003, some parts and situations of this movie sounds ridiculous in the present days. For example, nowadays the dialogs of Ellen, Pidge and Sheriff Todd regarding the use of guns are funny and politically incorrect. But when watching a movie, the viewer must be conscious of the values of the society when the film was produced. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Meu Ofício É Matar" ("My Office Is to Kill")
