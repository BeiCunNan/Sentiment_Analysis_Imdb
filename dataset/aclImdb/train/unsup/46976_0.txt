This stupid, stupid religious horror film starts out with an arbitrary premise and goes precipitously downhill from there. Evidently there is some sort of demon that has been held captive for thousands of years, and for some unexplained reason it is set loose every thousand years. To stretch its legs, I suppose. One girl gathers together a bunch of devout college age believers to witness the demon and prevent its escape, and what we get is a ludicrous mess of a movie that does no justice to the enticing cover box, which should qualify as false advertisement.<br /><br />Let me tell you a little secret about that demon on the cover box, by the way. It is by leaps and bounds the most interesting thing that the movie has going for it, and it is literally on screen for less than one second. That should give you an idea of the intelligence level of the movie.<br /><br />I made the mistake of watching this disaster two days after watching The Passion of the Christ, arguably one of the most powerful religious films ever made, so when I saw Jesus with fangs in this movie I almost fell over backwards at the sheer, overwhelming dumbness of it all. Even without the fangs the guy who plays Jesus looked like some slob that got up off his couch just long enough to put on some sheets and make a pathetic attempt to play Jesus. This guy blew it that badly and he was only playing Jesus in some girl's nightmare. Then again, he fits right in with the rest of the actors, who deliver some staggeringly bad performances.<br /><br />One IMDb user makes the astounding claim that this movie is beautiful, then goes on to suggest that the acting is not as bad as other reviewers claim. Well, in that regard he's right.<br /><br />It's worse.
