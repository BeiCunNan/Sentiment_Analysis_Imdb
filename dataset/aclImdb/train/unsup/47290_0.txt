Let me state the obvious: This film has nothing to do with voodoo, there are no blacks in it and nary an exorcism occurs. This was filmed at the height of the blaxploitation/horror era when movies Like "Blackenstein" and "Blacula" were popular, as was a film titled "The Exorcist." If you think using burnt cork to make white actors "look black" is a hoot (and racist), then this film will leave you shaking your head and wanting to conjure up the ghost of Al Jolson real quick. I don't know what they used to darken the skin of these untalented actors, but to me it looks like watered-down Shinola.<br /><br />I own this DVD as it was part of the 50-pack "Drive In Movie Classics" set, but I only keep it for historical / hysterical reasons, as I am a collector of old "classics." The only redeemable thing about this film is that it shows that for the most part, white producers and directors are a bit more in tune with black sensibilities.
