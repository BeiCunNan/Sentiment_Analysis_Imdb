The movie consists of two different parts - two different approaches to the storytelling. The mutual thread - what people are capable of doing in the search of the inspiration... Not to mention the main character's alienation, which is a leitmotif in all Solondz's works. Even though people tend to criticise the first, short part, it is quite interesting. I think that the key to that part is the teacher's comment on Marcus story, "The Wrongness of Truth": "is that supposed to be a joke of some sortor are you just being pretentious?" Quite a gimmick The second part - well, it's just a masterpiece. Makes you feel depressed and amused at the same time. Truly admire Solondz's work
