I think this is a good film but not quite as great as some reviewers think. Mostly the problem is with the cast. The characterizations other than Liza as Sally are uniformly flat. Michael York is incredibly boring and the same could be said for the rest of the supporting cast. The two German actors and the beautiful though dull Marisa Berenson. Therein lies my problem with the movie. It's worth a look, the musical numbers are great but the plot somehow meanders, and is only of real interest because of the looming Nazi undertones. As for Liza, well, you either find her annoying or cute or perhaps annoyingly cute. The one truly magnificent element in the movie other than the musical numbers is the classic performance of Joel Grey as the emcee. For that the movie is worth seeing but unfortunately the rest of the cast Liza exempted (sort of) are not up to par.
