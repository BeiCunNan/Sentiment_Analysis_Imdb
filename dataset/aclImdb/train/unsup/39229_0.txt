Do not see this film. There is no plot, no story, and unattractive people. The whole film consists of a woman cutting at parts of her body. I had to look away at many of the bloody scenes. I would have walked out, except I wanted to see how it ended. The ending was ???? Who knows? The small group of people who attended this showing were grumbling on the way out. What a waste!
