The movie was brilliant. It opened your eyes to a side of prostitution you never seen before. These are just regular people who come from a different background, different life style and different beliefs. The girl that really got to me was the one who was forced into prostitution by having her families lives threatened. These people view prostitution different than the rest of us. That doesn't necessarily make them wrong, make them sinners, it just makes them different, like everyone else. In fact, this movie intrigued me so much I am trying to find the book the movie was supposedly based on but am having trouble doing it. Apparently this book is no where to be found. If anyone has anyways of finding this book would you please email me and let me know how to purchase it. Thankx.
