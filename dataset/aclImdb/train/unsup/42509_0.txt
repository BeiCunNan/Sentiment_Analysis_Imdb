Hangar 18 stars Gary Collins as one of three shuttle astronauts who see a UFO in space while attempting to launch a satellite. The satellite hits the ship, killing one of the astronauts. The UFO then crash lands in the Arizona desert where our government picks it up and takes it to Hangar 18 for analysis.<br /><br />Robert Vaughn, who hasn't looked this good since "Teenage Caveman", plays the White House aide who thinks the government needs to keep Collins away from the UFO since the president's re-election is on the line. Why this is the basis for the plot escapes me. This isn't a conspiracy insomuch as it is a flimsy reason to have car and plane crashes, aliens, and a wild cross-polinization of species theory all in the same movie.<br /><br />Any government that could let Gary Collins live through an entire movie just has to be full of idiots. Plus, when you have Darren "Carl Kolchak" McGavin studying the aliens, one can only envision Christopher Lloyd getting his inspiration for "Back to the Future", and that's not a good thing.<br /><br />The sad thing is that the ending of the movie is set up about halfway through. But, the whole movie is like that. You know who's going to die, and when. The movie has plot holes large enough for the Rockettes to dance through.<br /><br />Sterno says let James Hetfield of Metallica beat this Hangar 18 with his guitar.
