Since Filmation was given a hard time making this movie by Disney, they should have just given up. It REALLY is THAT bad. NO adult can sit through more than a few minutes, and you end up wondering if it's doing any permanent damage to your kid's minds. Make them watch something good - if you're anti-Disney, try the "Iron Giant" - but NEVER let this into your home. The script, the animation, it's all REALLY that bad. Every actor on the project should have sued to block it's release. Really. This is the darker side of film-making - a good idea gone very bad. I never told my kids they couldn't watch it, but I could never sit with them when they did. To me, that's the worst possible scenario.
