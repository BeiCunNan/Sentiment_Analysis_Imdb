Dull, predictable lifeless story about a widower who gets a second chance at love with an old college flame after a chance meeting. Good thing his wife died, huh?<br /><br />Joseph Brooks probably figured "You Light Up My Life" packed 'em in to theater's so why not build another film around another one of his syrupy songs? Problem is the song is even worse than "You Light Up My Life" and Joseph Brooks doesn't make for the best leading man. There's absolutely no chemistry with Shelley Hack who looks bored throughout.<br /><br />You've been warned. <br /><br />
