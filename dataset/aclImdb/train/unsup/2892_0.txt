In this true coming-of-age story, young Matt is ready to leave his one-horse town and travel with his best friend Schultz. The only thing keeping him in town is his father's garage, which isn't doing good business. He doesn't want to abandon his father, and decides to stick around a little longer (of course, falling for the new girl only helps solidify his decision).<br /><br />Schultz wants to leave more than anything, because he's in an abusive home, but Matt still doesn't want to fully make up his mind. Only after a tragic event does Matt finally realize that he has to look out for himself and not for others.<br /><br />"The Garage" delivers in every aspect. You're drawn into the story and equally as drawn to Matt and the predicament he finds himself in. Its stirring, moving, and profound in a very low-key way. Definitely worth a viewing.
