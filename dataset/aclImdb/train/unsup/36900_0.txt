I would not advise anyone to waste their time with this movie. Its a dull, unmemorable and lame little film. A wealthy banker kills women with his crossbow as part of some hunting ritual from South America which is never really explained or given any elaboration whilst the police investigation headed by Robert Forster tries to get to the bottom of things. I've probably just made the movie sound more interesting than it is. The movie padded out with subplots about a pimp blackmailing the titular banker and Forster's annoying and shrill reporter girlfriend baiting the banker on her news show so she can be kidnapped by him for the predictable finale and also with some pointless soft core sex scenes. Most of the killing scenes are dull and unmemorable and most the movie is by the book padding. The only high points to the film are the presence of Robert Forster, who is still good even in dreck like this and gets a few good lines and one scene later in the movie when the banker deals with his blackmailer. Its such a nifty little scene it doesn't seem to belong in this movie. However, it is not enough to recommend this one.
