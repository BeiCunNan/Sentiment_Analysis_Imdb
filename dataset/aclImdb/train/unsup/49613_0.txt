If you like Bullit, well, you'll find the same stuff here : a good cop doing his job whose colleagues are often corrupted. Great. I remember how Steve McQueen used his gun in "Bullit" : he didn't shoot even once. Here, the actor and director Fred Williamson kills quite the whole city, to get evidences of stuff we don't understand clearly. The bad point is that it is a bad movie. The good point is that it's so low budget that takes are not done again when an actor reads his script on paper or when others start to laugh in a crucial moment...
