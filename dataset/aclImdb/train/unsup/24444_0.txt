This film was AMAZING!!! Being as how UMA THURMAN is already my favorite actress, this movie just made me love her more. It's a great story. It lets us look at love from so many different angles. All the female characters in this film are strong an independent, but each is so lonesome, and yearnful for love, that they inevitably seek love in all the wrong places. This is a movie that will make you think about your life, and the way you search for happiness and contentment. There are ASTOUNDING performances by Uma Thurman (obviously,she won the golden globe she was so great) and also by Gena Rowlands and Jullite Lewis.I'll admit it, I laughed and cried during the course of this movie. You feel so bad for the characters when bad things happen. You connect with them all, and try to relate to them. It's a great feeling to go see a movie, and be able to leave a different person. Thats what happened to me after seeing this film! You all should check out this movie and appreciate all the love and heartbreak it brings to the screen!
