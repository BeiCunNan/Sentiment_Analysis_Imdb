what a weird line! But anyway, this film looked like was Saturday afternoon BET melodrama with a good budget. The acting was so bad that you would need to be a die-hard fan of at least one of the cast members in order to get through it. In my case, Blair Underwood did it for me. Even though his character is the most vile, evil, manipulative, and ultimately unlikeable person in the entire film, he still manages to give an awesome performance and show what acting is all about. I wish I could say the same for Richard T. Jones who looked so stiff and uncomfortable in the role of Summer G, a record label executive who has it all, except for his one true love. And the one that got away happens to now be married to Underwood's character, Chip Hightower. Chenoa Maxwell (whom I like to refer to as Halle Berry on steroids) walks through her role as Sky Hightower with such ease but sometimes overdoes the more dramatic scenes. Andrew Royo, who plays her cousin Tre steals almost every scene he's in, except for the ones with Underwood. The film in the child of Ralph Lauren's son, Andrew, who also doubles as a cast member named Adam Gordon, Summer G's publicist. I am told the film was inspired by the Hollywood classic, The Great Gatsby. Hopefully, the classic was better than this fluff!
