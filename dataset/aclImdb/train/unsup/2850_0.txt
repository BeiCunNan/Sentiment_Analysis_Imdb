This is, as another comment already stated, a truly original movie. It's an episode movie, but not Boccaccio-style, tale by tale, the tales are developing from each other, and some characters keep reappearing. There are at least three reasons to love this movie: The performance of the director himself as the psychopathic ticket collector; the short segment showing musical indifferencies between dutch construction workers and Indian immigrants, and the timeless sequence that just hints at a very weird sexual orientation of a designer. This scene reminded me a lot of Bunuel's anarchism, see, i didn't just include his name above to be pretentious. The movie manages to be very funny at times, but some scenes do leave a bad taste in your mouth, without being sentimental or pathetic at any time. I've seen this movie three times now, and not just because i had some pretty bad experiences with ticket collectors and bus drivers too. If you get the chance to see it- Don't miss it.
