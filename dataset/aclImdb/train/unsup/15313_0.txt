I rented this movie not expecting much, and that is a good thing because this film is a real stinker. The overall idea is not very original, which is okay. Some gangster named Jimmy Bones died and is coming back for revenge, or something or another. Plot does not really matter for a movie like this, you just watch and try to enjoy the ride. Now, this is not near close to the worst movie I have seen, I have seen far, far, far worse, but it is also quite far from the best movies. My main gripe with this flick may sound dumb but...pink blood? What is that? The pink blood really takes a lot out of it...it makes it more unrealistic (though not realistic to begin with) and just looks...bad. I have seen $5,000 budgeted films with better looking blood! And other than the pink blood, the movie is just stupid and annoying to me. I say avoid, but some may like it. Worth a rent, I guess, if you want to see a cool pool table death......with pink blood.
