An incredibly uninspired television anthology sequel that has little to do with the first fantastic film, except that the lead character in all three stories is played by one woman. It goes something like this: Lysette Anthony goes all gravedigger and gets chased by giant rat puppets. Lysette Anthony gets chased by a wretched child actor playing her resurrected son in a pseudo-Gothic setting. Lysette Anthony gets chased by the infamous zuni fetish doll from the first TV movie except the special effects are somehow worse two decades later. Even this last segment is uninteresting. Anthony is obviously no Karen Black, but she does a good job with the garbage she's given.
