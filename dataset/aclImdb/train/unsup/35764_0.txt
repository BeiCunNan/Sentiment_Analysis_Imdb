My room mate and I ended watching this movie by accident and right off the bat, we thought that we were in for a good time. The music swelled and the mood was set for a scary movie. Unfortunately, we were so put off by the thought of sleeping with each others' father that we were slightly disturbed and nothing happened to keep up the scary pretenses. The plot seemed to take unnecessary twists at the end and the 'steamy love scenes' weren't as much steamy as ridiculous. The lead actors and actresses do a good job at holding up the absurd plot line, but the supporting actors need to pull their own weight as well. This is a good movie if you want to laugh your butt off at the dialogue and plot, but if you are looking for a 'thriller' you need to avoid this film, for it will not fulfill your requirements whatsoever: the only thrills in this movie are sexual ones, and even they aren't that thrilling, just sick and twisted.
