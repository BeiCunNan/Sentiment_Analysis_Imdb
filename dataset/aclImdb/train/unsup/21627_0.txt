Contrary to one of the other comments (which, actually, I'm happy to see, seems to have been in the minority). Interesting, different, off-beat, down-to-earth, refreshing, real. Interesting characters, well-portrayed, trying to make it real and make it work in a non-usual family situation. Patricia Heaton was very good and very attractive. You could see the potential, and I was glad to see her eventually make it big. Nikki Cox was interesting and a lot "realer" than in her later teen sexpot role in that "Married With Children" ripoff. Unusual, off-beat plots and execution made it really something special in my opinion, way beyond your average family-based sitcom (and without taking the more low-brow approach of MWC and its clones -- not that I have anything against MWC, but I think that THIS show accomplished something more significant). I would have liked to see it go farther. It certainly deserved more of a shot, as did Gaby Hofmann, as the central character.
