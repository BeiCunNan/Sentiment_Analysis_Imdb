I really enjoyed this film, it's great fun. I thought the characters were very entertaining, I'd recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />It was wonderful to see Michael York back as D'Artangen after all this time. Susie Amy, who played his daughter Valentine was brilliant and so were the three young Musketeers. The only thing I wasn't totally convinced about was Gerard Depardieu's character - The Cardinal, it was at times difficult to understand what he was saying because of his accent. All in all it's feelgood film that would be suitable for all viewers
