Remember CRITTERS, the 1980s movie about small alien creatures that looked like balls of fur and they rolled all over the place when they attacked unsuspecting earthlings. These critters went through windows and doors, with their big teeth. When I watched THE MARINE and John Cena as the marine in question reminded me of that 1980s movie. First, John Cena has massive set of teeth. Second, we also see him repeatedly jump in and/or out of windows or literally crashing through doors and rolling in a ball formation into houses. That's all we see him do in this really awful action film. This is Cena's first major role and unless they make an official CRITTERS remake, I don't see him doing any more movies. Yep, THE MARINE was that awful.<br /><br />But what memories about CRITTERS though. Thanks John.
