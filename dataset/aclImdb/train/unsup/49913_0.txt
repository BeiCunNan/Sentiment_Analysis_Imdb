First the positive sides: Some beautiful pictures/ shots, some funny moments, a lovely actress playing with charme and surely this will put a smile on your face. On the other hand, what comes along as "funny" is often rather serious in reality and so in my opinion, the movie wants or tries to be "lighter" than it actually is. The jokes can be foreseen (clever is something else!) and are sometimes a little forced, plus there is a lot of clich√©, so the genre of "kitsch" is perfectly fulfilled. It reminded me a little of the movie "Amelie" which I disliked for similar reasons. There is better french humour, charme and "feel-good-movies" than this. All in all, this one was a bore to me.
