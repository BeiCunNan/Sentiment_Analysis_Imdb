The acting is to die for; the cliff house is to die for; Peter Sarsgaard is to die for. In other words, the movie's not ALL bad; it just falls apart really quick - and unfortunately in just those key plot moments, so you walk out of the theater ready to slice it like a Ginsu, then talk about something else.<br /><br />Like, did they really have to beat us over the head about the POISON PLANT that JUST HAPPENS to grow in the back yard. Didn't see that coming. Or about emailing with a dead person? Huh? Or how Peter conveniently FORGETS he told that woman his favorite online chat site. Oops. Or when one of the characters admits to being bisexual... HELLO, YA THINK??<br /><br />Go. See it. Really. I MEAN it - if you want to get out of the house and/or satisfy your curiosity. But at the same time, prepare to cringe when Sarsgaard screams like a little girl during his orgasm. Actually, any little girl would sound like a grizzled old lumberjack next to Sarsgaard's orgasmic tittering.
