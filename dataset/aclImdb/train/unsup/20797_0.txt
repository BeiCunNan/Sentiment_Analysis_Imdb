Not quite up to most of the other Stooge shorts I've been watching, but I did like and am surprised that nobody commented on Curly's skunk skin cap. Good touch right there.<br /><br />The ice fishing routine was of course quite good Maybe the high point of the film. The depiction of the Native Americans was of course the typical stereotype;e, but what else would you expect in a Stooges short.<br /><br />For me personally, the most entertaining feature was the banter between Nell and the Stooges. Like her remark that she'd shoot them if she wasn't running short on bullets and Curly's helpful comment that he has lots of bullets.<br /><br />All in all, quite enjoyable but not the tip top best for the boys.
