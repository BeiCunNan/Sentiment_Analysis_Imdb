I loved this movie. It was suspenseful and kept my interest throughout. Al Pacino and Ellen Barkin were perfect in their roles. Both were playing characters of a type that they had played before -- so perhaps not too original. But the film was well made and carried the viewer along. Although some of it was obvious, I for one had not guessed the ending.<br /><br />Overall, this movie interested me much more than did a top-20 box office film I saw this past weekend at the theater (which shall remain anonymous here). Pacino played his role very well; his performance harkened back to his prime in the 1970s when he could be absolutely riveting on screen. Ellen Barkin in this film is playing the sexy kind of role that she played all during the 1980s. She is very good in this one. John Goodman was also very good as the police partner of Pacino. His sort of light easy attitude (even when he was very serious) played very well against Pacino's dark and brooding persona.<br /><br />
