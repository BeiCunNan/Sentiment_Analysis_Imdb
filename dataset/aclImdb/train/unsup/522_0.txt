The Hole was a very trippy movie.<br /><br />I loved it. I'm planning to arrange a movie night so all my friends can watch it with me. That was one of the sickest things I've seen in a long time. The thing about it though was it was scary, just not supernaturally scary. It was psychological and not macabre. I didn't feel scared afterward; let's just say I'll be a little more careful about my friends from now on. Thora Birch was a grade a psycho. I thought the girl looked like Keira Knightley, I had no idea though.<br /><br />It was playing on one of the movie channels and I got bored so I decided to watch it. That choice has probably changed me. It was an excellent movie. I'm currently trying to find it on DVD
