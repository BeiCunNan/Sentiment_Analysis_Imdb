A very good , solid, direct for T.V. movie. I had the fortune to watch it on "Cinemax" and I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />The movie deals with the hard situation that popular lawyer Abe Ringle is going through after losing several cases in a row and not being able to recover from that situation. Things change when basketball superstar Joe Campbell is accused of rape with violence. Campbell decides to hire Ringel as his lawyer. Ringel and his super hot assistant, and other team member figure out and win the case although they know that Mr. Campbell is in fact a disturbed person that gets excited after insulting and raping women. Ringel discovers that Campbell murdered an ex-hooker and threatens him about demanding him. This is where the movie gets interesting on the legal field because it shows topics like the lawyer's professional privacy about his clients, rape, testimonies, murder, etc.<br /><br />Things get bad when Campbell decides to take revenge on Ringel by seducing Ringel's sweet but hot daughter Emma. Campbell manages to get her on a hotel room and tries to rape her after telling horrible things about her dead mother. <br /><br />This movie is very interesting even if you are not familiar with laws. It moves in fast pace and manages to keep you entertained. Watch this movie and you won't regret it because it's a solid drama with likable characters, great acting, and most of all, it's entertaining and very believable.
