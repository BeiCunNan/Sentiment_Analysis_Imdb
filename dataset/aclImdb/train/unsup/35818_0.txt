The lead security specialist at a bank is forced into robbing the bank he works for: his family is held hostage and the ruthless villains threaten to kill everyone.<br /><br />Now.. This could be the base for a very worthy thriller. There's been a number of films around this topic that do work out after all. All added together there are the standard parts for a thriller: a villain that wants a lot of money/power/whatever, a victim that is to help him, and a number of victims that are used to make the other victim help the villain. Then there is the bits where the villains don't get what they want and threaten some more, the bits where the unwilling working victim finds a way to work against the villain and so on.<br /><br />But there you have it. All the parts, added together, make for a normal thirteen in a dozen thriller that has a number of things in it that are so damn odd that it doesn't work out. It's a shame. It wasn't played out half bad and it wasn't irritating either, but it wasn't good, it wasn't fully enjoyable.<br /><br />Add to that the fact that the things they do to computers are just utterly ludicrous. I, as a software designer, cannot handle that. Not at all.<br /><br />Too damn bad. 4 out of 10 standard mistakes.
