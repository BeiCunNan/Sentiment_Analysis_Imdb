I agree with the other review. This DVD reminded me of Richard Pryor Live. Katt Williams is hilarious in this. The DVD is Katt's show back in his hometown Cincinnati. It is intimate and it shows by how he connects with his audience. It feels like you are there watching it. Katt's takes on single fatherhood and baby's momma had me rollin. You will be watching Katt williams Live over and over again. I already know the jokes by heart but it gets me laughing on the floor each time. Definitely a classic!!! If you are thinking about watching this, I suggest you get it now because it's worth every penny. Not a single dud in there. Whether its spelling, math, or basketball, Katt has a fresh take on it all.
