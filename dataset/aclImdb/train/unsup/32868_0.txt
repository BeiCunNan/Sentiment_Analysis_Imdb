Let me make this very clear, 'Appaloosa' is the worst and most boring western i saw, usually i have always found great drama, fun and action in this genre, from classical John Wayne's westerns to Sergio Leone's legendary spaghetti-westerns, and this movie offered me absolutely nothing. This is extremely outrageously boring and dumb movie, what in earth did encourage Ed Harris make this movie, he thought he can make something like 'Unforgiven' plus 'Hondo' and he obviously got his head too much into some stuff that aren't important in western and in the end he made this pile of junk. Most surprisingly this movie actually has very famous cast, there are like 4-5 star actors, but not even appearance of famous actors could've made this movie any better. A disgrace to western genre!
