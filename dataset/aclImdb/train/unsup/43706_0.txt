Watching this disaster, I think I must've said "I can't believe that I'm still watching this" about fifty times. I'm supposed to believe that the guy from Mannequin is tough? HAH! And Robert Patrick, shame on you! In this film, Evil T-100 you ain't.<br /><br />I would've rated this movie a "1," but it was comically bad. Too bad MST3K isn't in production anymore - this one's prime material.
