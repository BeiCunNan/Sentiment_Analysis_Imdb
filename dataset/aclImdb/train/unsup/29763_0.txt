this is a very disgusting movie. i would refrain from watching it unless you are into mother and son sexual perversion relationships, molestation and bondage.<br /><br />i was bitterly disgusted. there are ways to film such scenes showing everything! the closeups of penises are uncalled for. the script is confusing.. the movie is a waste of time, unless of course you're into these perversions, in which case i would suggest surfing the net for the material.<br /><br />oh and on a technical note, the camera work is jerky and pans/zooms way too fast (like 70s cheap flicks). seems as though they only had one camera to work with..<br /><br />ma mere, ma trash<br /><br />Kristine
