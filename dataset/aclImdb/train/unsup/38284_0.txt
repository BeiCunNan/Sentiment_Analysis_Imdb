The music is bad, the acting is below par, I can't tell the dubbed voice of the main character from his internal dialogue and the storyboarding is horrible. Not to mention the special effects and props and costumes. The very LEAST the director could do was to remove the bar-code sticker from the supply-store bought axe Helgi throws at the tree.<br /><br />You'd think that the director has never seen a film in his life let alone studied any cinematic or storytelling techniques in order to prepare for creating this one.<br /><br />I give this film one star, because it is simply the worst film I haver ever seen. I judge my films from what I have seen so far and I don't really let budgets interfere with my opinion. Because you have less money to make a film, you should focus on what is actually possible to do WITHIN the budget.
