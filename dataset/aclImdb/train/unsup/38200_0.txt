Pretty uneventful slasher film about a cheer-leader try-out competition at Camp Hurrah becoming a tad sour when someone starts knocking of the cheerleaders. It's kind of obvious who the killer is, and mostly, the film is full of all the horror cliches you've ever seen. McKenna's disembowelment is rather fun, but most of the splatter FX are the everyday `garden shears through the back of the head' type of thing. The end is a bit of a let down and a bit unlikely
