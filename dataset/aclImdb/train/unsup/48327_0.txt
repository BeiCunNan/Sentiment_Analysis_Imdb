(this is my first IMDB comment BTW, after using this site for years)<br /><br />I found this movie the worst movie I've seen in a while (I've gotten good at avoiding them).<br /><br />I found the movie a little redeeming because it's quite easy to make fun of it while you watch it.<br /><br />While watching this I couldn't help but think of two other movies: Wild Things and Scream (or Scream type movies). This movie have the plot setup of a bad teen horror flick. That's fine (I guess) for what it is, but then there's no payoff unlike Scream and Wild Things. If you're going to make a shallow, extremely predictable movie then at least give the audience some steamy or bloody scenes to work with.<br /><br />The acting was bad except for Frances McDormand.<br /><br />Funny how both of the people who tempted Alex and Sam from each other had foreign accents. It's this kind of thing that made this movie feel like a Cinemax flick.<br /><br />To the movie's credit: the IMDB user who said that the plot was implausible (I couldn't tell if they were being sarcastic or not), the sad truth is that it's totally plausible that that exact thing is going on in Laurel Canyon right now (I live a block away). It's probably going on right now, including the bad acting, shallow personalities, bad music, hippie mom, yadda yadda yadda... If this was the perspective of the movie maker, then this movie is genius.<br /><br />Anyhow, I'm done..<br /><br />
