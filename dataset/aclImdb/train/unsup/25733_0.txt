I saw this film at the Austin Film Festival last week. Definitely above average, but there were places where the story felt disjointed, such as why Max has such an attitude about Western women--the opening scene doesn't do it for me. And a little more about why Max is running into financial trouble would have been nice. Overall, a very good movie with standout performances from Warburton, Marie Matiko and Eric Roberts.<br /><br />What I liked most is that this was a non-threatening exploration of spirituality and attitudes towards marriage, as well as the genuine emotions evoked at the end of the film. It deserves a wide release and the opportunity to find an audience beyond the festival circuit.
