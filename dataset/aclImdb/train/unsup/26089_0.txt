If you want to see an array of beautiful sea creatures that no longer exist, by and large because they're butchered for no reason in this awful movie, then this film becomes a treasure of historical documentation. Otherwise, it's a plot less story about three and four way sexploits with the final few minutes dedicated to the premise of a shark horror flick. Unfortunately for me I had to sit through the whole thing as I had started it and it was too hot and windy to go outside. You do get ideas about how you'd like to have that much money so that you could live on a yacht without responsibility and the promise of toast after toast with your latest shag, but the continual slaughter of sharks, sea turtles and stingrays for a movie such as this leaves one filled with guilt.
