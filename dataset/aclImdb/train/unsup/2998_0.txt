this is a must see for Aimee graham fans. i think it's one of her better roles, as she does remarkably well with this made for Cinemax movie. good supporting cast including Matt Le blanc in a cameo role. i wondered when they would get around to putting this one on DVD. congrats to Buena Vista. as for her gift of running, she had a lot to run from, including an abusive father and a lame boyfriend. running can be very therapeutic and can also imply a sense of urgency as a medium to escape the predicaments of life one has been dealt.<br /><br />Cinematography is well done, at least the TV version that i copied off Cinamax one night. i think i wore that one out. it was released in VHS in other countries including England and Germany, but i believe this future release(April 2005), will be the first time it will be readily available in the U.S..
