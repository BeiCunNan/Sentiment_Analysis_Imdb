The other day, I was bored. I chose to see a movie. The movie that started nearest to my arrival at the cinema was Harry Enfield's much hypes 'Kevin and Perry Go Large'. I was somewhat hesitant to see this movie as even those little 3 minute 'Kevin' sketches on Enfield's TV show bored me. Frankly, the idea of making one of these sketches over an hour long seemed like a bad idea from the start.<br /><br />The movie was dire.<br /><br />Enfield did not amuse nor ever has amused me. The few scenes that I enjoyed were played by the under used Kathy Burke or the much funnier Paul Whitehouse in a mere cameo role. Laura Fraser continues her run of bad movies ('Virtual Sexuality', anyone?) and Rhys Ifans has gone even lower (if possible) in my estimation.<br /><br />Usually, when telling somebody about a movie I would finish by saying' but you should see it for yourself'. Not this one. I strongly advise you all to not see this movie... EVER.<br /><br />Oh, and 'I wanna do it with you' is more irritating than than nettle rash.
