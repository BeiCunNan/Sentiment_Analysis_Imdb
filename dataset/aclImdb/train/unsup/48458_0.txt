This would make a great midnight movie where everyone could throw popcorn at the screen and yell at the idiots in the movie. The U.S. is under nuclear attack, most of the military bases wiped out, radiation clouds spreading across the country. A helicopter is blasted out of the sky between Washington D.C. and New Jersey by a thermo-nuclear blast, and the survivors are discovered by a little boy strolling through blast zone with a stick like Huck Finn in the wee hours of the morning? Who then goes home and gets his mother to come back and save the men? Hello! Nuclear war! Bad time to let your children out to play in the radiation!
