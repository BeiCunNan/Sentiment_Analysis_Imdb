this was the worst movie ever....i can't believe i paid to see it... this movie tricked you into see it by claiming "based on a true story of a serial killer still at large" please...very very mad...i really would like to beg people to not see that movie...they'll thank me when they see it on tbs in a couple of years or something...and one more thing why did the black guy die??? a black guy always dies!! and since the movie started i knew he was going to die..and what was that whole slavery was a good thing?? idk.. i just think this movie didn't have any high points at all. i should have gone and seen Arthur and the invisibles or something other than primevel!!! but seriously the main guy only had like 20 lines in the movie what was that about??? if you are reading this please donate the money you will spend on the ticket for this movie because it'll be put into better use, cause trust me it will not entertain you at all!!!!
