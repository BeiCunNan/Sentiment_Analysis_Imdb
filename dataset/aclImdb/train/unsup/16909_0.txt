I can honestly say that there was nothing about this movie that bothered me. I truly enjoyed the whole film experience. Gwyneth was wonderful as was Mr. Douglas and Mr. Moretenson. I realize that a few people have complained about the older man - younger woman relationship, but who cares? It's a movie. Deal with it. A decent thriller worth your time. Way better than one of Gwyneth's other thriller movies "Hush" - that one was horrendous. This movie was quite tense - not so much as say "Seven", but it was still an enjoyable watching experience. I recommend this film if you enjoy thrillers.
