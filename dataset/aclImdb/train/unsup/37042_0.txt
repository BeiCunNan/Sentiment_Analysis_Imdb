I remember when Aamir Khan gave a good bashing to Amitabh Bachchan and said that his movie "Black" Was a copied.Although I agree with him,but now Aamir Khan's new movie "Gajni" is a blatant copy of Memento .<br /><br />And i could not believe it when I heard in the media that Aamir Khan said his movie is totally original.(Still cant believe that,he think nobody ever saw Memento).<br /><br />But after it was pointed out that Memento had a similar(which I believe is exaggerated, it is the SAME not similar), Aamir said his movie was better as he could not understand Memento(I could not understand what Einstein said, so I'm better huh?).The movie is simple you just have to figure out the parallel time-lines.And it the parallel time-line which adds to Memento's appeal.<br /><br />Mr. Aamir Khan , you maybe a respected actor but you're a lousy person.Sorry,I have lost all respect for you.
