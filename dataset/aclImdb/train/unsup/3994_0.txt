I'd heard about this movie because a friend of mine let me know that Adam Brody was in it. She's really into The OC and wanted me to watch it with her. I was curious to see what Adam could do outside of the TV show and was completely pleasantly surprised. Adam Brody's acting was excellent.<br /><br />The movie can appeal to both the young and old alike given the diverse cast. I was immediately drawn to it more because of hearing that Illeana Douglass was in it. I'm a fan of her! <br /><br />The film can also be especially appealing at this time since it deals with losing someone in the war. It was such a touching movie, it made me cry and I totally recommend it to anyone!
