This movie got my attention because its producer claimed it'd compete for Oscar foreign language film along with the Banquet and Curse of the Golden Flower, another two big budget Chinese films. But this small budget movie fails to stand out both for story line and performance. Its setting is basically within an apartment building. With twisted love among an unfaithful husband, a heartbroken wife and of course, the lover, a salon owner, the story seemingly is trying to tell how the mystery can evolve into something to grab peoples' heart. Unfortunately, it rapidly runs into mediocre with basically no surprise at all. Its acting can't score anything either. Carina Lau has some shining moments, yet with an emotionless(trying to be sophisticated?)Jun Hu, there is really not much to tell. Its supporting roles are also weird and unconvincing. Well, it is an ordinary story. Maybe it happens everyday in China nowadays. If you are interested in peeking into the changing society, you might find something intriguing. Otherwise, turn on your TV.
