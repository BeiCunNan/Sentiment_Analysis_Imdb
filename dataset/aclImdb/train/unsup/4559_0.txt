Oh my gosh this DVD is amazing. I have only recently became a huge fan of the band. There are some parts that I will watch over and over again. In fact I can't stop watching it full stop. My fave parts are all the interviews, the crazy stuff about the room service, how many times Brad says " like". All the footage of the band when they're on tour is so good. The pranks at midnight in one of the hidden features are just hilarious. The guys just seem so lovely, down to earth and it has to be said very attractive. I am now determined to get every DVD going about them. The other parts I love are the making of the In the End video featurette which is fab as it shows how everything is put together. The DVD is as fab as Mike Shinoda is gorgeous.
