If I could give zero stars, I would. This is present on a 4 movie DVD of Bigfoot movies and this is the worst. It concerns loosely a tracker going into the wilderness after the "missing link" to earn 100,00 dollars. Of course, his backer has ulterior motives. That is as comprehensible as the plot gets. The acting is nonexistent; the lead reads his lines in scene after scene, including a trek thru the forest, from a clipboard he holds. Finally the entire movie, halfway thru, is completely voice-over. People appear and disappear at random, they run from the beast in terror and the next moment are chatting quietly. There is no resolution of the plot, people are killed right and left and the characters don't seem overly concerned.<br /><br />For those that care, there are several scenes of naked breasts, all the female leads, simulated sex including bestiality by the beast on one of the females, not a pleasant sight. and there is totally gratuitous guitar and mandolin playing a la Deliverance.<br /><br />Worse than "plan 9 from outer space"
