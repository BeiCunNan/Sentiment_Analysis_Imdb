After reading a review on this film and seeing it for only Â£2, I thought "How could I go wrong???"<br /><br />I was (unfortunatly) mistaken....<br /><br />Didn't anybody else (apart from myself) think this film was just PATHETIC ?? How any body can call this a "horror, comedy or fantasy" is beyond me. The ONLY excuse this film has is that it was low budget and was made in 1987.<br /><br />The are SO many 'goofs' in this film you wonder how they didn't notice them.<br /><br />Personal opinion.......AVOID AT ALL COST !!
