I have to agree that this is a dancer's movie ... one can feel the aches, the sweat, the soul and the spirit. But it is not only for dancers; it is for anyone who truly loves dance. It provides insights so deep that no person could ever watch another 'dance movie' in the same way again; this one film - 'One Last Dance' - so far surpasses, outclasses, every other dance film made that it makes them all look pathetic. (Other than 'A Chorus Line', which until I saw 'One Last Dance' was my choice as standing apart from all other dance films.)<br /><br />The dancers ...<br /><br />What can one say about Patrick Swayze other than that he s sublime!!! He will, without doubt, live forever; he is the spirit of dance.<br /><br />George De La Pena - magnificent! Lisa Niemi ably completes the trio - and does so beautifully.<br /><br />I really loved this movie, and will watch it again, and again, and again.
