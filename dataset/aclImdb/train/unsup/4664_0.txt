Let's face it: after "Batman and Robin," the Batman movie franchise needs help. If only WB would realize that the solution is right under their noses! I've heard that "SubZero" went straight to video after "B&R" bombed, despite plans to release it theatrically. WB, please don't do that again! "SubZero" is what the live-action films should be.	<br /><br />Mr. Freeze, voiced to chilling perfection by Michael Ansara, is one of the best characters. The term "villain" cannot be applied loosely here. Yes, he is cold-blooded (literally). Yet you just cannot help but feel for this guy. He does not do anything for money, power, or fame: he does it all for love. Mr. Freeze is basically nothing more than a man who loves his wife so much that he will do anything to save her. His intentions are good, but he goes about it the wrong way. In that sense, he is no different than the rest of us. And deep down, Victor Fries does have the power to love and can be gentle, as seen in the beginning and touching ending of the film. Top this film off with a great score and the fact that Barbara Gordon gets to hold her own against the baddies WITHOUT her Batgirl suit, and you have a winner.	<br /><br />So please, WB, release more animated Batman films like this one into theaters. Spend money on them! Promote them like you would "Wild Wild West!" See what happens!
