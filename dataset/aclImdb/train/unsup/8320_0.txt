Circles within circles, metaphors for metaphors. Blood and gore. It is a joy to watch a film that dares leave things to the imagination. The Attic Expeditions refrains from explaining too clearly what is going on. The basic plot is obvious enough: magician has magic book, does bad thing, gets amnesia. Evil brain doctor wants magic book and orchestrates nefarious plot to drive magician insane.<br /><br />There is more to the film that just that, and it is not always clear what is real and what is not. Cleverly revisiting plot elements and using circularity to great effect, The Attic Expeditions keeps the attention from start to finish.<br /><br />Jeffrey Combs is perfectly typecast as the therapist with an interest in the arcane arts and Ted Raimi makes a very good counter-balance to him as his observer. The acting through-out is good - where it may seem occasionally woody, this turns out to be appropriate. Seth Green is great and his character gets some very good lines. Watch out for the scene in the play room, where Seth and Andras Jones walk round and round the sofa. It is one continuous shot.
