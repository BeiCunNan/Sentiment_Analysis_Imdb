We have really come a long way in terms of visual storytelling and the types of shows that get produced on television, but when I was watching it, the one thing that stuck out was Bob Fosse's choreography. Especially in the "Ring the Bells" number, it really shows how he was able to bring so much to live. Also, we should remember that a primary reason this was able to be resotred was that he paid so much attention to detail, some technical aspects of the show that they were concerned about were able to be salvaged.<br /><br />On another note, I think you get a somewhat good glimpse of the 70s when you watch this show.
