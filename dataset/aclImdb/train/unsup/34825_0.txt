This is one of many so-called "educational films" of the 1930s that were really sad excuses for sleazy low-budget producers to make films that could slip nudity and banned material past the censor boards. Starting in late 1933 and early 1934, the Hays Production Code was dramatically strengthened to eliminate nudity, extreme violence and decidedly adult far from movies. Believe it or not, before this time, all kinds of taboos were relatively common in films coming from reputable Hollywood studios. However, after the Code was strengthened, perverts and the curious went looking for seedy material and found it in educational films that were really just excuses to show boobs and talk about sex and drugs. As educational material, some states DID allow these films to be seen, though I seriously doubt that parents went to them to learn how to better raise their children! <br /><br />The main theme of GAMBLING WITH SOULS is forced prostitution. It seems that a local gambling den is actually a front where nice young ladies are hooked on gambling and then forced to become hookers to pay off their debt. The story begins with a police raid and seeing a blonde shooting one of the leaders of this hole. The rest of the film is her account to the police of what led her to this murder and how she lost everything due to gambling.<br /><br />The film is very obvious and trite--with only passable acting and a script that, at times, is very silly. Certainly NOT a great film but oddly watchable if you are a bit of a voyeur and like bad films. Otherwise, beware.
