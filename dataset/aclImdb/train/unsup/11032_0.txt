It's low budget shows in its grainy print and poor sound, but the quality performances by the entire cast make up for the films shortcomings.<br /><br />The late Craig Russell pulls out all the stops as he displays his talent for female impersonation. Hollis McLaren is the ideal nut case. And Helen Shaver, in one of her earlier roles, is ideal as the friend who is accepting of people for who they are, embellishing their positive traits.<br /><br />My one criticism of the film is the costuming. Not Russell's drag apparel, which matched each of his impersonations perfectly. But other wardrobe choices in the film were distractingly awful, especially during the Christmas party scene. Russell's jumpsuit was about 3 sizes too small, and Shaver's dress was something out of Ringling Brothers' clown reject closet.<br /><br />Still, students and lovers of independent film will admire this one for its style, its daring, and its overall effort.
