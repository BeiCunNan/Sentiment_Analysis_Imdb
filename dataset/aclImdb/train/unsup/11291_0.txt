Considering the slur's used against the Japanese that I have heard since I can remember, was one used in the movie. I have seen this movie from the time I was six years old. Toyko Joe having missed shooting down Col. Scott, hides in the clouds and sends his two wing men to get him. Col. Scott says to him over the radio,"You wait right up there Joe, while I play Dixie on these two buck tooth pals of yours." I was surprised it was never changed, dubbed over. I have always enjoyed Mr. Loo's acting in all the Charlie Chan movies as his # 2 son. The fact he did a comedic part made it worse when he showed up as the evil Tokyo Joe.
