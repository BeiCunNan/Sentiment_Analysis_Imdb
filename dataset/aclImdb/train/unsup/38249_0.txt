I wasn't thrilled by this movie, or even vaguely moved. I was<br /><br />restless and listless and found myself looking at the scenery and<br /><br />the camera movement, a sure sign that it is not working on any<br /><br />level. As Emanuel Levy says in his book Cinema of Outsiders, this<br /><br />film has a "senseless narrative and flaunts an arrogant style, but<br /><br />like The Usual Suspects, it's hollow at the center." I agree. .
