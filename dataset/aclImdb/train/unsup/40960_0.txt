Colonel Rick Gibney was awarded for shooting down Flight 93, which had been hijacked by remote control by the White House, as confessed by Pentagon in Operation Northwoods. Will Oliver Stone or Mel Gibson please make a movie about THAT?! http://piratenews.org/flight93.html<br /><br />"The U.S. government has consistently blamed me for being behind every occasion its enemies attack it. I would like to assure the world that I did not plan the recent attacks, which seems to have been planned by people for personal reasons. I have been living in the Islamic emirate of Afghanistan and following its leaders' rules. The current leader does not allow me to exercise such operations." Usama bin Laden, CNN, "Bin Laden says he wasn't behind attacks," September 17, 2001<br /><br />"The goal has never been to get Bin Laden." General Richard Myers, chairman, US Joint Chiefs of Staff at Pentagon<br /><br />"On June 5, 2006, the Muckraker Report contacted the FBI Headquarters, 202-324-3000, to learn why Bin Laden's Most Wanted poster did not indicate that Usama was also wanted in connection with 9/11. Rex Tomb, Chief of Investigative Publicity for the FBI, said: 'The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden's Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11. Bin Laden has not been formally charged in connection to 9/11. He has not been formally indicted and charged in connection with 9/11 because the FBI has no hard evidence connected Bin Laden to 9/11'" Ed Haas, Muckraker Report, "FBI says, 'No hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11'," June 6, 2006 http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorists/terbinladen.htm<br /><br />"We've never made the case, or argued the case that somehow Osama bin Laden was directly involved in 9/11. That evidence has never been forthcoming." Dick Cheney, WhiteHouse.gov, "Interview of the Vice President by Tony Snow", March 29, 2006<br /><br />"I don't know where he is. I have no idea and I really don't care. It's not that important. It's not our priority." George Bush Jr, March 13, 2002 <br /><br />Operation Northwoods: http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20010430/doc1.pdf
