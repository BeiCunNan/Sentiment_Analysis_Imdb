This movie was the first made by the Spanish company Fantastic Factory, they have released later two films more "Arachnid" and "Dagon" but While these two have been a total flop "Faust" was at least a bit more successful. Nevertheless it was, at my opinion, the worst of the three.It was nothing more than a kind of "Spawn" rip-off but more cheaper and the plot and specially the dialogues were written in a completely careless way. I still remember a scene in which the female leader character was talking about her rape when she was a child and she defines the raper as "The soft man", everybody laughed at that and the dubbing of the Spanish actress Monica Van Campen was so ridiculous that again everybody laughed when she talked (Despite her undoubtful beauty. But not everything was a disaster here, at least special effects were OK and there are some funny moments.I only hope that Fantastic Factory gets better monetary and artistic results with their next film"Darkness" directed by Jaume Balaguer√≥, the author of the very interesting "The Unnamed", I trust in that project which has good actors in it such as Lena Olin or Anna Paquin, on the contrary this adventure of Filmax in fantastic genre will have a very dark future.
