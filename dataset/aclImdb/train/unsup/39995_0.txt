Five young adults head off to Mexico in search of some waves that one of the group's brother said were great down there. But when they get there the brother and his friends are nowhere to be found. They soon clash with demented (possibly demoniacally infected) locals. The acting was serviceable if nothing special, the mere fact that this is a low-budget film, i can ignore that. What I couldn't ignore was the lack of good lighting were a good portion of the movie or the reliance on shaky-cam shots during the action scenes of the film. Or, for that matter, the surprising lack of gore. What we're left with is a somewhat boring travelogue of Mexican scenery for a good part of the movie and inane banter. Skip it and rent "Turistas" or something else better that this movie is akin to.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Joleigh Fioreavanti gets topless <br /><br />Where I saw it: Netflix online view <br /><br />My Grade: D-
