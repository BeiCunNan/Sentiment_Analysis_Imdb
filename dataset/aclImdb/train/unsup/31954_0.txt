John Boorman's Excalibur is a brilliant re-telling of the grand legend of the Western European world, the once and future king, Arthur of Britain. It pares the Malory epic down to its basic core and recreates an entire fantastic world--the myth of Arthur, not the historical reality of Arthur. It suceeds magnificently. If you love fantasy you will love Excalibur. Furthermore, the music is divine: Siegfried's Funeral March (the sword's motif), more Wagner (Lohengrin and Parzival), plus the Carmina Burana. Highly recommended--all other Arthurian films fade to black and vanish in one's mind once you have seen Excalibur.
