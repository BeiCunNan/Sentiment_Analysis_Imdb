I somehow expected this movie to be hard and dark, but it turned out to be a comedy, which seriously lacks humour. Therefore the bestial scenes of the movie are terrible, with the antichirist at the end, and so is the humour which just can't make you laugh.<br /><br />If you like to watch a confused priest, who wants to act funny and prevent the apocalypse to happen then maybe this is your movie, but definitely not the movie for me :P My personal opinion is that this movie really sux, and i had to write that down, because i saw the ratings here on the movie and expected something good.<br /><br />BTW: I also know the heavy metal scene in Madrid and death metal concerts never looked like this! :D
