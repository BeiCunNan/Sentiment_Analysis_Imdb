The bomb is about to go off any day now outside and inside the home of Rose. She has a stepfather who loves her little sisters but doesn't really adore her that much. Jack has other problems as well such as drinking and flashbacks from war. One day he likes Rose and then the next minute he becomes a horrible monster. I see that this movie is like a bomb going off. The characters in the movie have no idea when this bomb is going to go off. They also have no idea when Jack is going to fly into a rage or have another flashback. It's a sad little movie but it has a lot of sense of reality attached to it. Then Aunt Starr comes in a gets involved in all of it. She adds some spice to the whole bomb. It's a great movie.
