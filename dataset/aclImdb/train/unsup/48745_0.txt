My biggest problem with this film is Garry Shandling. One has to ask why they cast him in the lead role. He is not handsome, endearing or charming at all. To be honest he is annoying and a mediocre actor at best. I had to wonder why Annette Bening's character even looked twice at him. The film is interesting in an odd way. It is truly original. But it loses steam and could have been much better with a better screenplay and a better lead actor. It's a shame.
