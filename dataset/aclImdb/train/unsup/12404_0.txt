I was pleased to find this film on cable here in the US. I understand why it got little notice in American theaters. Its welcomed unAmerican flavor, like a unPasteurized blue cheese, was delightful, but not box office unfortunately. Kresten, the lead male character, is a modern urban male in a global sense. Cell phones are commonplace in the film. However, the dynamic between him and Liva, the female lead, who is a prostitute hired as a domestic, illustrates some basic differences between American and Danish cultures. The sexuality in the film is very real, even though it is fleeting. The moronic brother, perhaps overplayed, seems an anachronism in comparison to American mental hygiene standards, anywhere outside of the Ozarks. I was particularly fascinated by the sharp dichotomy between city and country in a highly developed nation the size of some American states. The world's oldest profession was also portrayed without all the typical American barbs. It just seemed like a job. Finally, the credits are probably the most stunning I have seen in years. They are done as multimedia paintings on film, complete with flies crawling around them. Brilliant and beautiful. I highly recommend this film.
