When a man (Hopkins) kills his wife it seems like a slam-dunk case for the ambitious prosecutor (Ryan Gosling), whose mind is already set on his next lucrative lawyer job. But, in Columbo-style, Hopkins does not play his cards until in the courtroom, and it looks as if he may get away with it. This embarrassment even threatens Gosling's current and future job. It becomes a match between the cool-headed "Hannibal"-like genius Hopkings, and the smart and ambitious Gosling who takes Hopkins' bate. Gosling is willing to risk his career to put Hopkins behind bars.<br /><br />The main question is: what happened to the murder weapon? A mix up with cell phones provides the answer. <br /><br />But even when Gosling figures out how Hopkins did it, he cannot be tried twice, because of the double jeopardy law....<br /><br />Who will have the last laugh? Watch and you'll find out. I found the ending rather pleasing, logical but somewhat unexpected.
