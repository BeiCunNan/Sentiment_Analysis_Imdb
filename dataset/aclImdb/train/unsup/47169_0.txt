I honestly don't see how so many people thought this is a worthwhile children's show. My daughter refuses to watch it (she's 2) and I couldn't be happier. It's so annoying, the story lines are idiotic, the voices are cloying and awful ... If it disappeared tomorrow, I wouldn't miss it. I just don't understand why the animals whine all the time, and are so afraid all the time, and just so under-your-skin pests all the time. I can't believe there are only two of us who've posted negative reviews. The others have to be employed by the show or something. It doesn't teach anything useful, it's not entertaining or funny ... It's a waste of 24 minutes.
