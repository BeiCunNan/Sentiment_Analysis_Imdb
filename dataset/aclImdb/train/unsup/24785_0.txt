Early on, I made the Woody Allen connection, thinking to myself, "This beautiful woman sees herself as a Woody-Allen-Nebbish-Type." Incredible! And, sex, sex, sex, everywhere there is sex, just like in real life. And also, just like in Woody Allen movies! Thought her take on seeing sex from the American (prudish) point of view and seeing it from the French (free and easy) point of view was interesting and funny. Weaving a smart plot and clever one-liners together was quite brilliant, too. (Ala Woody Allen!) I agree that Delpy did a great job on this movie and that it's something she and her family should be very proud of. She created a real work of art.
