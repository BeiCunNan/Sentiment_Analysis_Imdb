The movie is terrible. I saw it thinking it would be an action movie (nothing to think about, just relax). Unluckily, I found my self annoyed by the bad production of this movie. Bad effects and acting. It looks like a low-budget one-shot production. Casting is regular (except maybe for the hot ladies that perhaps are a must in this kind of movies).<br /><br />For the rest, I watch movies from beginning to end, and if this is a spoiler: The intro is kind of cool, however, the subject could be better explored and attacked. <br /><br />The lack of script starts showing up after that first scene making the movie a pretty bad clich√©. A tough guy beating bad guys, in the same way a kid beats bad guys in Home Alone.<br /><br />It is sad that a good project and a good plot is poorly abstracted to the screen.
