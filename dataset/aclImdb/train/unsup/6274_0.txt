This has been the worst movie that I have seen in quite a while! The acting was horrible, so was the editing, the script and everything else about this movie. It was as if whoever filmed this movie walked into a taqueria with a home video recorder and told the employees to"pretend" that they were in a movie.Watch "Doce Horas" if you truly want to want to watch a funny movie with great actors!
