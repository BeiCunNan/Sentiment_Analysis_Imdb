My wife is a HUGE Rick Springfield fan, so we watched this on Lifetime recently. I love B flicks as much as the next person, and this low budget romantic-thriller is as cheaply made as they come. Despite the Parisian setting, it's apparent that this was not made in France. All of the scenes featuring Paris landmarks are pretty much stock footage, but that's only a minor glitch in this predictable movie. The plot is fairly improbable: A scholar switches places with her fashion model twin and heads to Paris, then gets involved in mystery/romance/blackmail. I've never read a Harlequin novel, but am assuming that this is pretty much the standard formula. Surprisingly, the movie didn't even have any Rick Springfield music! Perhaps his songs were too expensive to use on the soundtrack. Who knows? It's bad stuff but perhaps Rick fans might enjoy.
