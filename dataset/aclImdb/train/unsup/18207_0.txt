Having seen an advanced screening of this, I think fans of sci-fi action will dig it. There is plenty to enjoy here, cars, guns, graphic violence and some good make-up work. Made in the same city as the crap-a-minute Punisher, Tampa Florida, you'd never know they were the same city based on the gritty night time scenes in Unearthed. Obviously they didn't know how to shoot the city in the Punisher, because it looks like a much meaner place in this one. Probably has to do with the folks who made this one live there so they know the city better. If you liked Albert Pyun's "Nemesis" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107668/) I think you will also enjoy this flick a whole lot. Give it a chance.
