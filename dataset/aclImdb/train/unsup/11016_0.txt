I'm not biased or anything (being gay myself) but gay themed movies always seem to be better than most of the standard Hollywood fare that's churned out year after year. Gay themed films always seem more uplifting and fun to watch, and always stay with me long after I've watched them. Beautiful Thing, Stonewall, Grief, Priscilla, and now Get Real, one of the best films (gay or not) that I've seen in ages.<br /><br />Get Real is brilliant on so many levels. Firstly, it's a film that's realistic. It paints a picture that doesn't necessarily have a happy ending but still leaves you with a warm feeling inside. It's not apologetic, and shows some of the not always appealing aspects of gay life (cottaging, vicious gay-bashing, etc). But it transports you into it's charming world of first love and that feeling you get once you become infatuated with someone.<br /><br />The cast of Get Real are amazing. Ben Silverstone is a genuine star as Steven, pulling off the right mixture of pride and confusion excellently. Brad Gorton is equally good as John, making you genuinely believe he is a confused soul in a confused world. Charlotte Brittain is fabulous as Linda, and the rest of the cast are all perfect in their roles.<br /><br />Get Real is funny, moving and totally engrossing. A perfect movie for anyone who remembers their first crush, in fact, a perfect movie for any occasion. Quite simply, perfect.
