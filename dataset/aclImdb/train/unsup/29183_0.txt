This film made me look at cinema in a whole new way. It was something I have never seen before, from the various scenes, to the scenes that made me say wow. Some of the ideas in this film were brilliant, such as when they all sit down at the dining room except they are all toilets instead of normal chairs. This is quite comical. The part where the naked women appears to be really old, then her naked body reveals a young beautiful women said a lot to me. Emotionally, it showed me that we can't all be biased towards older women, and that they too have genuine things about them. The sniper rifle scene was also very humorous to me and scary at the same time. It made me wonder what if something like this actually happened, then the court room scene really made me laugh. It is a great film, interesting at that.
