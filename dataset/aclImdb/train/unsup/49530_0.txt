I purchased this film for the soul purpose of adding to my JESSICA ALBA library. She was in it for a whole 15 seconds. I will never get the other 90 minutes of my life back I spent watching this film. I felt there never was a clear plot to this film. At times the acting seemed a little sluggish also. The film also uses Morgan Fairchild as a star of this film...not! She only appears a couple of times. I feel this is kind of just milking someone in to rent or purchase this film. The ending comes to a close really fast and leaves nothing to the imagination.<br /><br />A pyramid that dispenses pills to make you feel however you want; how clever.
