The film (seen at a preview) provides an insightful examination of the world of the Tango in Argentina. Unfortunately, the vehicle for this examination is a familiar "hitman goes native for a while, but gets to go home again" theme. The script is flawed and the movie ends with lots unresolved.<br /><br />Robert Duvall stars, wrote, and directed this homage to the tango and Argentina. He is a consummate actor, a competent director, but a confusing writer. The photography in both Brooklyn and Argentina contains many scenes of breathtaking beauty. Duvall's scenes with Luciana Pedraza ( Manuela) are magical ,as are the sequences involving her teaching Mr. Duvall to tango. GÃ©raldine Rojas as Pirucha delivers a beautiful speech on the relationship of tango to life.<br /><br />The dancing! The Dancing!! The Dancing!!!
