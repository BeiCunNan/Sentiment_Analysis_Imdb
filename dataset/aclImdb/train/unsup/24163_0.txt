Once the movie ended, I started crying. I cried because this creation is one of those that truly touch you, and take you to a fantasy realm that can only be experienced in imagination. As for myself, not only did it do that and more, it also had me think about myself, and my current situation in life, and since my country damaged me so hard, I guess in a similar way, I wont experience a great deal if at all. Which makes me appreaciate movies like this one, that for a little while, I can forget the fact that my body is alive, soul wounded, and brain damaged.<br /><br />This is a great movie.
