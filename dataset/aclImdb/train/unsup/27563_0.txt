This show appeals to a certain type of audience - it's not particularly clever but it's enjoyable to watch if not taken so seriously.<br /><br />This is one of those shows that will age well given time - it feels like the actors/writers haven't quite settled into the show yet. Buffy the Vampire Slayer had a disastrous first season with terrible, cheesy writing, low brow plot lines and terrible acting... yet it went on to have a huge cult following and seven seasons. I think this series deserves a chance.<br /><br />The characters are endearing and it has a clear direction that I'm interested in. I hope we see a second season.
