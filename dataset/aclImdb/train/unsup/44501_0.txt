This Second part of Alex Jones' Science Fiction trilogy is just as boring and miss informative as the previous one. As a Science Fiction film (this film: 911: The Road to Tyranny (2002)), it is boring and no fun. As a documentary it is untrustworthy: because Alex Jones doesn't really have any sources for his wild claims. As a source he as always almost only uses him self. He says he uses old and reel clips from the media. The problem is that you can see that he has manipulated with them: Alex Jones uses clips from one context and clips into another: just as Joseph Goebbels did in Germany during the 30ties, as propaganda-minister. Secondly: every person who are right in the head knows that not all TV-reports are 100% accurate: all the first TV-reports from major events are always based on rumours, which always are exaggerated, and all his so-called "evidence" is based on this. But the so-called facts and all the theories are so laughable that it possible can't be a documentary: it must be Science Fiction (very bad Science Fiction) Â– it is as good as Ed Wood's "Plan 9 from Outer space". As a Science Fiction film it is tedious and boring. As a documentary it is based faked evidence, and can not be trusted. Don't watch it, you won't be learning anything.<br /><br />Grade: 1 out 10.<br /><br />It is simply just awful!
