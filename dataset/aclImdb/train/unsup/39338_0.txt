The movie is too predictable, after watching the half of it, you know by 90% how it will end. The quality of actors (especially the Chinese girl) could not be worse. She tries to act scary and mysterious, but it didn't go further than an attempt. There is an attempt to bring some humor in the movie, and I must say some lines were funny, as much it can be funny in such kind of films. That would be probably the single positive thing, I can mention about the film. You would expect, that they will link all events at the end together. Sadly it was not like that.<br /><br />I wish I wouldn't have spent my time by watching this film. Nothing new, nothing special, nothing...
