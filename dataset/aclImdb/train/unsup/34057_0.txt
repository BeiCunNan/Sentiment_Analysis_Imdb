It was gruesome and full of strange oddities. The basic plot of a man force feeding women to death is the basic key of desire to want to watch this movie. Well, besides the crime investigator, and the hardcore sex, thats basically what you see in this movie. A woman being fattened up until she's so morbidly obese that she cannot live on her own, and is basically bet on for how huge she can get and how long she will stay alive as an extremely fat woman. It was enough to send chills down my spine, watching 9/10th's of this movie. If you wanted to watch something that scars you for a while, then in that case I deeply suggest you stay out of watching this movie!Evren Buyruk
