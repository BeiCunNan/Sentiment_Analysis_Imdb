When you can't afford Matthew McC, hire Josh Lucas.<br /><br />America's new sweetheart, Reese Witherspoon -- night now, Sandy B. -- does her best at holding this most formulaic so-called romance together.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd type how I REALLY feel but I just realized that I'd be wasting more time than I did WATCHING this 122 minute fiasco.<br /><br />If you don't see every single angle coming, then you might as well stop seeing films.<br /><br />Utter trash.<br /><br />And I'm not certain that a single stereotype goes unwrapped.<br /><br />Reese, you're better than this.<br /><br />But after "Legally Blonde" and this, you might have to re-prove yourself.<br /><br />3/10<br /><br />
