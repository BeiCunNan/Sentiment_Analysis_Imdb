This was a hard movie to watch and I would not recommend it to anyone that I know. I'm all for character studies, even of characters that are in one way or another hard to like. Amadeus comes to mind, as does American Splendor. The Lion In Winter is a character study of sorts, of the whole messed up royal family that movie portrays. TV's house is sort of a character study. But those examples had something that this movie did not. Depth.<br /><br />Curmudgeons, jerks, petty people, you really don't have to like the main character to find a movie engaging. That being said, the main character in Five Easy Pieces was one I thoroughly did not like. Yes, he was a loner, but why? How did it initially come about? Hard as it was to watch him be such a jerk to his girl, she was probably ideal for him, since she let him treat her poorly, run off when he needed to, he screwed up- she apologized. Not my ideal, but it worked for them.<br /><br />So? Still, I'm left cold as a viewer, wondering why anyone cares. And yes he can play piano. But he doesn't live the piano man's life and I guess there is supposed to be some conflict, but many people have talents they don't take to the next level, etc.<br /><br />This movie was nothing special, if you ask me, other than a highly recommended and lengthy waste of time.
