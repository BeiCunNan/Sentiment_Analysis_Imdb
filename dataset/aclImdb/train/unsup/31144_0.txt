I rented this with very low expectations and thought i would at least have a good laugh or two. But 40+ minutes go bye and absolutely nothing happens except terrible camera work along with worse acting. As i further watched this "film" i became aggravated and eventually turned it off. If you are looking for a horror movie that could possibly make you pee yourself out of laughter. This is not it. One that i would personally recommend because it is very comical throughout is Mr. Jingles. Better camera, Just as corny but keeps your attention throughout and doesn't cause you to want to shoot your self in the foot.
