I think this show needs to be renamed to "Spoiled, Rotten, B****es" I have yet to see an episode without a rotten teen featured in it, and believe me, it's not a show I will ever try and catch a new episode. Yet another horrible TV show to add to MTV's already horrible lineup... whatever happened to the music? They could put that money to so much better use than giving their teen a huge gas guzzling SUV. I'm not saying every teen that grows up with money is spoiled rotten, just the teens featured in sweet 16. This is just another reason why I'm thinking of canceling my cable subscription, too many crappy shows on TV anymore without and substance to them... stupid "reality" TV killed all the good shows.
