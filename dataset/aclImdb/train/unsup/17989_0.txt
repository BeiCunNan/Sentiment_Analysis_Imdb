The Killing Edge has very little plot, and not much thought or money put into it. But this is a brilliant film when viewed as a spoof. Statements like "How about you Ted, fancy a shave?" and "But first Ted i'll shoot you, you little b@#!£" both directed at a teddy bear make this a very funny and enjoyable movie. There are some classic fight scenes including a near showdown at the end in which everyone gets shot about 20 times and live. I won't spoil it by giving away the plot(if you can call it a plot) but if you can get hold of this film you are extremely lucky.
