I select films that I do not think I have seen before. I have no idea who made them who is in them or what they are about. I just use them to fill an hour or so. Many I never watch to the end. I thought this was just another made in Hollywood movie. Instead it was the movie equivalent of the book I was unable to put down. No one, not the director, the actors or the crew imposed their message on me ( I saw the Irish pub theatre version of Alexander last week, that movie tattoos it's message on your eyeballs). This movie was peopled by personalities, pictures and places. It was a piece of Anglo French (or the other way round)excellence. My personal thanks to all those who made the movie for making me feel I had not wasted at least this time in my life. Smashing!!!!!!
