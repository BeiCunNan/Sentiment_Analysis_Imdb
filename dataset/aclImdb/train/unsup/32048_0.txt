Dreadful score, the direction is very amateurish, and the acting is well below average. Cheaply done and it looks it. The story isn't even that interesting. I can't see why they bothered to make it. What really irks me is how the totally obscure director (Christine Swanson) is listed as an award winning director. She won one award - Short Film Award at, get this, The Acapulco Black Film Festival!!!! Now there is a major achievement! Was she employee of the month at Wal-Mart too? Better yet, before the credits, it says that All About Us became a best selling DVD. It isn't even out yet on DVD, (Today's date 06/22/08, street date for the movie 07/01/08) so how can it be a best seller already!!! And it is very likely it won't sell at all. Misleading lies. What a turn off.
