In the IIWW, the British Service of Pedgeons is going to broke out. They are forced to send to combat little and inexperienced pidgeons to do the job. In these missions there is Valiant, a very young and courageous one, which, maybe, can change history. The story is the typical for kids: the good ones, the bad ones (but not very bad), some adventures and a happy ending. Though the images are quite good (CG image), the movie has no astonishing moments that one could expect when computers do the job. Anyway, this is a movie for kids, and, well, they probably would be unaware of that. The characters are easy to understand and typical, the story is not complicated and it has some funny moments. It is relaxed to watch, but an adult would probably be bored easily, as the jokes are very childish. This is not Ice Age or Shrek, but parents will not be very fed up (just a little), while kids will have a good time.
