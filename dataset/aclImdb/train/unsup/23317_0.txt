Okay what do you expect. This isn't the best comedy ever made but it has its moments. The twin sister that can't get along with her sibling story has been seen before in several movies. But face it there are not that many `new' stories out there. Mary-Kate Olsen & Ashley Olsen have been in the business for just about all their lives. This is their first major movie as just about adults (nearly 18). They do a good job in this movie but sometimes it seems they try a little too hard. Eugene Levy is really funny as semi-cop. If you go into to this movie knowing you are going to a Mary-Kate Olsen & Ashley Olsen movie you will have a great time. The girls are really fun to watch and the look like they are having a good time making the film. So go and have a few laughs and watch Ashley trying to hold her skirt down throughout the movie.
