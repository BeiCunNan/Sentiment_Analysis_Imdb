******SPOILERS********<br /><br />Atmospheric horror from the original Lewton crew. The stars are kind of weak and the script isn't as good as the first couple of Lewton Bs, but there is moody photography and a few scenes of real suspense. Some element of sexual violence can't make this film sexy like "Cat People" (in this case, we get middle-aged Bell instead of sexy Simone Simone), and the exotic locale isn't up to "Zombie" par either. The plot carries the film through its (short) length: a search for an escaped cat leads one man to seek for a human killer behind the alleged cat's killings. <br /><br />It seems like it would have been more interesting if that man (O'Keefe, playing it straight) had turned out to be the killer himself, but I guess that's maybe what the writers though the audience would expect.
