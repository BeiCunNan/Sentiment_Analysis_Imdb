What more can I say?? Dave is witty sharp and very very funny. He beats Leno into a cocked hat. The key for me is that he never has to try to be amusing it just seems to occur naturally. Dave Letterman is a rare talent. As for comments about when Dave should retire well I am sure that the man himself is shrewd enough to know when to bow out gracefully. Hopefully it wont be for sometime yet. It is worth mentioning Paul Schaffer as well here because the chemistry between host and band leader is always amusing. Both men are capable of spontaneity and this makes for such entertaining dialogue. Keep up the good work Dave (and Paul).
