Oh come on!!! Even if you hate chick flicks this is a hilarious film that has something for everybody This is a masterclass of Adam Sandler at his best, some might say he is a spent force, some might say he was never funny. I might agree with my first comment but this film pulls on the old heartstrings and makes you want to go visit the mens room because it makes you laugh out loud!!! As much as i hate to hate to say it; i have based my whole philosophy of love on this film and have found the woman of my dreams because of it ( with none of the corny 80's music involved!!!) Laugh out loud funny and a chick flick, what else could you need to impress the possible future Mrs or Mr in you're life?!?? It will go down as an absolute classic in my top 10 films
