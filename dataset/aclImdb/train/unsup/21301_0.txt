Harrison Ford proved in "Patriot Games" and this film that he's the best Jack Ryan. Sadly, this was his last turn as Jack. This film topped the others in intensity, scope and story. Involving Jack and the Government with Colombian drug cartels. Kudos also to Tom Clancy, director Phillip Noyce, James Horner's fine music score and the fine cast. Veteran actors made up a terrific supporting cast: James Earl Jones as Greer in a sad scene, Willem Dafoe, Benjamin Bratt and Raymond Cruz as the U.S. military mercenaries, a quartet of despicable villains: Henry Czerny, Harris Yulin, Joaquim de Almeida, Miguel Sandoval and Donald Moffat as the President and Anne Archer as Jack's loving, understandable and supportive wife. It will be difficult to match the quality of this production in future Jack Ryan films.
