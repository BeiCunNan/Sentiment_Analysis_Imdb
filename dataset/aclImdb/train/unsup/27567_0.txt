Geez, reading all the negative comments on this board you would think that the old Flash Gordon TV shows weren't even more campy and far cheaper looking. In fact, has anybody here even SEEN the old shows? How anyone could say the new Flash Gordon. Flash Gordon has always been light and slightly goofy sci-fi fun. The special effects in the new show are decent and no one on the show seems to be taking it as seriously as the critics here seem to think it merits.<br /><br />Let's face it. We're talking about freakin' FLASH GORDON here. This isn't Blade Runner for crissakes. If more of you could just take it for what it is instead of comparing it with the Flash of their youth (with all the warm glowing nostalgia) you might even enjoy yourselves. This is light entertainment, not cutting-edge science fiction drama. Lighten up, kids.
