This movie was great. I don't know why all of these people thought it wasn't good. If you haven't seen this movie, I advise that you should watch it. You will certainly laugh and you'll certainly have a lot of fun. Steve Martin is great, and so are Goldie Hawn and John Cleese.<br /><br />I rated it a perfect 10!
