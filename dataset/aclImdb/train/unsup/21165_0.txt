This is a fine film, it has a lot of talented people in it. Carey Grant, & Irene Dunne are great & really the whole cast is great. The comedy genius of Leo McCarey (who did some fine comedies with the Marx Brothers) is involved & the film is well done. <br /><br />The only problem is that now the plot seems a lot tamer than it was then. Back when we had morals in society, a man & a woman alone on an island for 7 years that were not married to each other was a big scandal. Now, with single women having kids without fathers, some having multiple kids with multiple fathers & with an anything goes types of morals involving girl & girls the plot in this seems to innocent. In the early 1960's this one was remade with Doris Day & James Garner (after Marilyn Monroe died tragically during her filming of it).<br /><br />If you want to see a fine talented cast making a fine film, this one is for you. When it was made, the theme seemed more mature than today, but this one can still give you a smile & make you miss the age of moral decay which today represents by taking you back in time to a era where this humor comes from.<br /><br />161
