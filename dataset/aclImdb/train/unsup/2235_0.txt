This is another of these films that a friend thought was great, so I went out and rented it, expecting more than what was delivered. It's certainly not what it's lived up to be, by either my friend or by critics in general. Frank Sinatra and Sterling Hayden were fairly interesting, and it was refreshing to see a patriotic line or two, but that was about it. The story had NO credibility! It was just so unrealistic it was embarrassing and insulting to watch, with very dated dialog.<br /><br />At least it was a short film. They didn't go overboard in dragging it out and making it even more talky and hokey.
