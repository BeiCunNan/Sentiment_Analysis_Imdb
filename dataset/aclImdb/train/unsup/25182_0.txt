Reasons Jason Goes to Hell is the worst in a pretty good series of slasher films:<br /><br />1) Jason is not scary when he's on "American Casefiles" (I think that's what the "America's Most Wanted"-like TV show was called. The whole reason he was scary was because he was this backwoods, crazy type of character that was based soley in legend and newspaper writings. Putting him on TV sucks. So does having the FBI go after him.<br /><br />2) He looks stupid in this one. That skin bubbling over the hockey mask is just dumb.<br /><br />3) They try to put too much plot in it. Come on, it's a Friday the 13th movie (isn't it?)! Forget this body-hopping and "Hellbaby" garbage and get the hell back in the woods, Jason!
