I just finished watching this show and my mouth is still agape. I'm scratching my head trying to figure out how this guy got one woman to agree to marry him, let alone three. It's not even the polygamy that bothers me. Quite frankly, I could care less. It's a lifestyle choice, not MINE,but whatever. The thing that bugged me was,on the day that he's going to town to pick out a ring for his new "wife",he chooses to don a t-shirt with the words "The Man" across the front, and a giant red arrow pointing,er,downward.Then,on top of that, he takes her to the pawn shop to pick out a ring. This pitiful woman is standing there in front of a row of used compound bows and shotguns,obviously trying to find that one ring that doesn't look like it was snatched off the hand of a dead pimp,and the whole scenario just reeks of desperation. Even if there were no other wives involved, every molecule in my body would've still been screaming, "Don't do it lady!!!" I'm willing to bet that he paid almost as much for that stupid t-shirt as he did for that ring. I don't even want to get started on those poor messed up kids. Still,I watched it all the way through, so I suppose I'm obligated to give a "better than watching paint dry" rating...but not much better.
