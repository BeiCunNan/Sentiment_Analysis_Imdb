I just finished watching this movie like 3 minutes ago.I was amazed by how much of a great horror movie that was.I was really surprised by how much i liked it.I can understand why they call this movie classic,because it is.It's a cult classic.Certainly one of the best horror movies ever made.And one of the best horror movies i've ever seen.Believe it or not,there's not much blood or gore in this movie.Just a lot of disturbing images. This movie is more meant to disturb you than gross you out.I did have two problems with the movie,though. First,some of the lighting during the night scenes weren't good.I had to turn the brightness up on my TV during the night scenes.Second,some of the scenes kinda linger on and you just wait for something happen and when it does you think "Finally!" But other than that this was a great movie.I really recommend for any person who enjoys scary movies.
