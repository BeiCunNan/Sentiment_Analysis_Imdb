If you liked 'Snatch', 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', then you're in for a treat! This is such a great movie! It's the story of two guys in the night in serious trouble. They have one body, one car and absolutely no idea of what to do with them. I won't say more, but I can tell you, you have to see this movie, it is a perfectly well done piece of movie making and as a bonus you get to see a De Niro's memorable line acted by a Mexican, what can I say? it's hilarious. It's a different, refreshing and funny way of making movies, specially for a Mexican movie. Don't miss it, you won't regret to see this if you have the opportunity. Superb!!! 9 out 10.
