This movie was shocking in its perverted exploitation of a teenage girl and her disabled younger sister (who's parents have died), by their twisted aunt and her disturbed sons. The movie gives no reasons for the aunts twisted behaviour nor does it explain why a neighbourhood full of children who visit the house whilst this poor girl is strung up, raped, beaten, genitally mutilated, and starved, say nothing at all despite the story being set in a 1950's world where such events were not heard of even in the movies. Furthermore the movie does not justify why these children participate in unbelievable levels of abuse before running off to play out with their ice-creams and trikes - it just doesn't make any sense. It goes no way to explain why the main character Davey is aware from the start that something is seriously wrong, yet fails to do anything at all to help the girl as the level of abuse rapidly moves from overly-intimate tickling to violent, bloody, perverted, shocking rape, until the last few minutes of the film. If Davey had said something earlier the abuse would not have reached the level it did and it is wholly inexplicable and unreasonable for the movie to expect viewers to swallow the concept that Davey would not have said anything to anyone. This movie strikes as another in a long line of torture-porn movies made solely for twisted individuals who enjoy watching a very attractive and intelligent teenage girl gradually beaten down and controlled with increasingly sickening and frightening abuse during which she is raped by young teenage boys who are watched by their mother who also seems to gain sexual pleasure from spanking the much younger sister. This movie is wrong and sick and will do nothing more than encourage the sick perversions of those very real and very dangerous people in our society who fantasise about this sort of thing. I strongly advise you do not watch this movie, at the very least out of protest that the kind of violent porn that is illegal has somehow made it into our mainstream media.
