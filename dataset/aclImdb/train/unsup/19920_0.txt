Forget Monterry or Woodstock! This is 100 times better! First of all, the comments are like razor's edge! That was peace and love? Never! Money was everywhere! That was trouble? Some sort! This is a great film in a cinema point of view? Kind of. But where it stands in 2000 is about the music. It rocks hard in a way Woodstock had never done! Violent performances by The Who! Hendrix, Ten Years after, Free are great! Watch early bluesy Jethro Tull doing a fantastic number! But not really the Doors... More rare moody numbers are delightfull, like Leonard Cohen. See Joni Mitchell full of emotions, because a freak have gotten on stage to make music with her. To me, this is the truly early 1970's rock music. Not that hippie music from Woodstock.
