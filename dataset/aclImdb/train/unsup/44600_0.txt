I caught this flick on cable one night and couldn't believe the sheer awfulness of it. Even if the borrowed footage and the cheap toy props were supposed to be tongue-in-cheek, it sure didn't work! And did anyone else notice that in the big "battle scene", they kept showing the exact same tank footage over and over and over and over and... well, you get the idea. Even if they had cast Leslie Nielsen, that couldn't have saved this mess. I gave this movie a rating of 1 only because zero wasn't an option. Don't say I didn't warn you!
