This is a film of the best kind, not to much slush, and action all the way, unfolds well, and keeps the interest right to the END!<br /><br />The fact that beaside Darryl Hannah as the star all the other actors are unknow or not well known this side of the pond, and that what makes it an excellent film.....l got it on video and watched it twice in the same day and that is something l don`t often do...<br /><br />I can really recommend this film, first rate.
