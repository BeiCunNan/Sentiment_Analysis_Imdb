This television show's been brought back to the Disney Channel. I saw it for the first time not too long ago, and I must say I was somewhat disappointed, though my judgment is biased.(I love The Lion King, so I guess I had high expectations.) But, this show's animation isn't exactly what I'd call good. It's basically Ren and Stimpy, but to my TLK-obsessed dismay, with Timon and Pumbaa.<br /><br />Criminal Quint is painfully annoying. It's my opinion that they should have used a more Lion King-related villain, such as a lion or hyena, but I guess I'm just being picky.<br /><br />A few jokes were funny, I have to admit. I just think that it could use a tad less slapstick jokes, and incorporate the original movies a little more.<br /><br />4/10. I've seen worse, but it's not exactly Grammy material...
