Saw this one at Guadalajara Movie Festival. Utter crap. Bad acting (for most of the part), horrible photography and one of the worst excuses of a script, even for Mexican cinema standards. It's evident that the filmmakers were trying to appeal to the public using lots of Mexican pop culture references (lucha libre, drug cartels, many b-movie comedy icons from "cine de ficheras" era), but ultimately without an at least coherent script, they failed miserably and should NEVER be given any more precious money to waste in this kind of turd.<br /><br />Recommendation if you did not get my subtle opinion: avoid like an Uwe Boll movie.
