I have been going crazy for the past 5 years while trying to find this older show and I just found it. I watched this show back when I was in high school and became really drawn to the lives of these women trying to survive. I thought I would never remember what the title of this show was but I refused to give up looking. This show left a lasting memory in my mind, just like my memories of watching *M*A*S*H* reruns as a teenager and other great shows. If anyone likes older shows with military and watching people try to survive a living hell, then this show is wonderful to see! I used to have to sneak watching it because of the strong content in it and my parents wanted me raised in a more "sheltered" lifestyle but I am a survivor of tragedy in my own life and could never forget what these women went through just to live through to the next day. I know it's just a show but even a show can remind you to follow your heart, keep a strong will, and overcome anything that is thrown at you and I feel that this was an excellent "foght for survival" story.
