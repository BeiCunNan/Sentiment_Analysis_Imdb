NAKED FEAR is actually a better action/suspense movie than it would initially appear. The movie theme of sociopathic hunter hunting an innocent, kidnapped person is not new. The twist this time around is that the intended victim is female. However I now recall a 1987 direct to video movie filmed in Australia where a bunch of outback lowlifes terrorize a woman then decide to hunt her like prey. She turns the tables on them by, yes, getting really angry and then going after them with hand-made weapons. Another similar movie was a movie-of-the week back in 1977 where a hunter played by Andy Griffith accidentally shoots a homeless old guy in the desert. When his hired guide refuses to remain silent, Andy Griffith hunts him down but in the end is thwarted by a slingshot found by the intended victim.<br /><br />SPOILERS****SPOILERS****SPOILERS<br /><br />Like the other intended victims of the other movies, Diane (Danielle DeLuca) decides not to be a victim and fights back, which makes all the difference. When you watch the movie, you get a sense of that a remake was done of the NAKED PREY, a classic back in 1966 starring the late Cornel Wilde, who depicted a captured guide hunter in late 1800s Africa, set free to be hunted by the African tribesmen hunters. The plot development is similar. The hunted victim falls back up an incredible will to live and survive and resolves not to be the victim. Also it helps in all the movies of this plot them that the intended victim was in good physical shape to begin with.<br /><br />I won't be a hypocrite who enjoyed watching attractive Danielle DeLuca run for her life in the nude and then criticize her later for doing a nude role in a B thriller movie. Danielle obviously saw this role as an edgy action thriller which was correct because the nudity was not pornographic. She was willing to go the extra step in depicting total helplessness at the start. It would have been too easy for the psycho killer to have kept her clothes on. My only astonishment is how she could have run barefooted in the New Mexico outback. From what I believe I know about New Mexico there's a lot of thorny mesquite trees in the countryside. I recommend this movie as worthwhile watching for a decent action/thriller. I always see the moral and ethical lesson in such movies. You can choose NOT to be the victim and fight back if you want to, no matter what the odds against you. Like Cornel Wilde in NAKED PREY, Danielle De Luca (Diane) started out her struggle for survival with literally NOTHING.
