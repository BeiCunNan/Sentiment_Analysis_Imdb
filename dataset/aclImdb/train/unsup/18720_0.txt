"Yor's strong, he's our man!" Those are the first words sung at the beginning of this movie! "That bad?" you ask? Yeah. Should I see it? Yeah, especially with a group of rowdy folks who like to make jokes during a movie.<br /><br />Our first image is of Yor, looking like Conan's impotent brother walking into the wasteland. As the movie progresses, we are fed with cheap lines (e.g."We must have fresh blood to appease the gods!"), ladies in skimpy outfits (I don't complain about that! But no nudity!), and cheesy effects (e.g. a bat creature which looks more like a kite). Did I forget to mention that it has one of the worst theme songs in history (hey, at least "Flash Gordon" had cool guitars and good vocals!).<br /><br />Half way through this film, I thought that the directors might as well have made a porn film with this material--then I would have given this movie some credit! Unfortunately, the actors take this movie so seriously, they try to deliver their lines with the utmost sincerity, only to fall flat on their face (e.g. when the villain Overlord calls Yor's girlfriend "the fresh rose of fertility", Yor proudly, but flatly states "You can't have her, Overlord. She's my woman."--what original dialogue!)<br /><br />So why do I recommend this film? As you can see, I have seen this movie only once, yet I can remember half the ridiculous things in it with such accuracy! Yes it's bad, and if you are bored with your drinking pals on a Saturday night, watch this film and you will be laughing for eons!
