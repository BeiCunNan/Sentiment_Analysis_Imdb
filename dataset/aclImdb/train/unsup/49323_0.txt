This movie is so bad, but has the right elements to cause a cult following. Two psychopathic garage mechanics, Alex(David Hess)and Ricky(Giovanni Radice), invite themselves to a party of social climbing snobbish types. This 'with-it' crowd, begin taunting and making fun of this low life duo without knowing the mayhem to come. Alex and his mentally challenged friend decide to have their own brand of fun and take everyone hostage and begin humiliating, torturing and raping for their own amusement. But how is it that a group of people are threatened by one straight razor? Alas...there is a twist; the two tormentors don't realize that they have actually been set up as the guest have their own agenda. Other cast members: Annie Belle, Christian Borromeo, Brigitte Petronio and Lorraine De Selle. Redeeming, no way. Worth watching, kinda.
