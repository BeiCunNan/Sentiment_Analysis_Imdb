After watching this, I have two conclusions: the time period in which this was made, immediately after the 50s, was not as idyllic a society as many seem to grieve. This was a sick, deluded world in which such a despicable film would be force fed to so many kids. Secondly, we've come a long way, except that black people are still often cast as the violent criminal in popular entertainment...just like in this one.<br /><br />Important to watch if you are interested in how the media can be a factor in how the unthinking masses come to conclusions. I'm not sure I understand how this is averaging even 3 stars...I agree it's important to watch, but that doesn't make the film "good." Not even "okay." It's absolute rubbish. Even as propaganda, it's blown out of proportion, and the music is cheerful and inappropriate.
