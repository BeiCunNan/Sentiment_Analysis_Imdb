A slinger(?) from the future looks to take revenge on the group of pirates who killed his family in a post apocalypse wasteland. Also on board is a cyborg who has the cure for a plague and holds the key to the survival of mankind. Of course she must deliver the information in her head to Atlanta and she needs a hero to deliver her from the pirates. I must admit that Cyborg is one of those movies I found extremely funny. Where as I can give other action flicks a higher rating because they actually do a few things right, Cyborg manages to do practically everything wrong. The action sequences are decently choreographed but the ridiculous nature surrounding them and interminable grunting and screaming which accompanies them make this a laughable effort. Plus the movie is often times hard to follow coherently and Pyun tacks on far too many pointless flashbacks to beef up it's (thankfully) scant running time.<br /><br />Also why on earth does the main bad guy wear chain mail when he's in a hot climate half of the time? <br /><br />* out of 4 (Bad)
