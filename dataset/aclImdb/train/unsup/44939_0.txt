I will admit that I rented this movie because of the title. I thought it would be a low budget horror movies that would just make you laugh. However, this movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Really, don't waste your money on this movie. It does not frighten you, it just is full of blood and gore. The acting is also atrocious, and if you have not been living in the UK for the past few years you will not understand there mumblings. Susannah says ring ring...hello. The reason why I gave this a 3 was because the plot does have to deal with the basic idea of human instinct in extreme situations which is an interesting<br /><br />theme.
