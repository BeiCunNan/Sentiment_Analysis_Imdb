..why the heck are you reading the user reviews?<br /><br />Timecop is the only VanDamme film that I've seen that ever should have been released. Yes I watch at least parts of his films to see if it can possibly be as bad as the previous one.. this one is the 2nd worse.. cant remember the name of that one. J.C. must thank providence every day that the VCR had been invented in time for his "Career".<br /><br />But I have to differ from other reviewers regarding Pyun's direction... when you accept the given that the set production cost about $1.98, I think the direction is the only interesting part of the film. <br /><br />BTW: 1. The street fires are ridiculous... supposedly it has been years.. but there's still refuse fires burning. 2. NOW I know where "Whhaaa--a-a-aZzzzzUUUUPPPPPP!" came from! (the Atlanta street fight)<br /><br />I guess this film and others like it may fill the time between WWF pay per views.<br /><br />I dont see how you could even give this a 2 without skewing the curve.
