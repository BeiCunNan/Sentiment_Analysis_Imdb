"Strictly Background" is a great film! Two thumbs way up! There is a reason it has won so many awards and been featured at so many festivals. Director, Jason Connell does a good job of picking interesting characters to follow and then keeps the film moving. The music, editing and special effects also add to the momentum! It really sheds light on the "extras" industry and shows the ups and downs of being in it. You really feel for these guys! Finally these extras get to be the stars in this film. Bravo! It's all around fun! It's a must see! Can't wait to see what Connell has up his sleeve for his next project. He's one to keep an eye on!
