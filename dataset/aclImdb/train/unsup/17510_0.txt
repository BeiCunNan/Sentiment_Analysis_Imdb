look elsewhere. Those looking for an exceptionally well made docudrama about the battle for Santa Clara and the time Che spent in Bolivia look no further. The performances, photography, score and direction are superlative. But seeking answers as to why Che became a guerrilla fighter, his family life and any psychological underpinnings regarding his love of Marxism will have to be found somewhere else. The film is rather a straight forward re-creation of some battles fought hard and won (or lost) in the foundation of modern Cuba and late 60's Bolivia. Those worried about being brainwashed needn't worry. There is both bitter humor and irony in this film which will satisfy both sides of the spectrum. This review is for both parts of the film. They're equally brilliant.
