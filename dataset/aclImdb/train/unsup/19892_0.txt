Wow. I loved "Best in Show" and "A Mighty Wind", so I was really looking forward to this one. It was dreadful, though. I don't think I laughed once during the last half hour, and precious few times before that. I think the biggest problem was this: in "Best in Show", "A Mighty Wind" and "Waiting for Guffman", there was a certain sweetness of spirit. Even though the characters were the jokes, Guest never seemed to dislike them, or make us dislike them. There was always an underlying fondness of them. Not in this film, at least for me. A mean-spiritedness seemed prevalent, especially in the final scenes, with Fred Willard going to interview and make fun of the people who didn't get nominated. Unfunny, nasty, and not even keeping with the reality of the film. It was the first time I was glad that Christopher Guest's films were so short. I certainly hope with his next one he's back to form.
