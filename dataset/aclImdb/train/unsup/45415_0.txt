Terrible film, terribly overacted, terrible over-used plot. Although this movie sports some well known thespians, they cannot hide how utterly terrible this film actually is. Even accounting for a low budget you cannot but flinch from the attempted suspense which soon becomes repetitive, after 30 minutes I was wishing the unseen alien would just wipe out the motley bunch in one swoop. How an actor from 'the Godfather ' could associate himself with such rubbish beats me. Do not pay to see this film!
