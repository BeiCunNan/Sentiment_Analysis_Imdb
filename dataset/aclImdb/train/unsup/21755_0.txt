With a title like 13 EROTIC GHOSTS I was under no illusion what sort of film I'd be watching - A rather threadbare plot revolves around a bunch of supernatural investigators finding out about ghostly happenings after a girls school is struck by lightening and burns down in a special effects sequence that wouldn't look out of place in the cheapest DOCTOR WHO production <br /><br />As you can imagine this threadbare plot is just an excuse to show some lesbian love action and despite the sex scenes not being up to the erotic standard of ALLYSON IS WATCHING the sex scenes are fairly good for this type of genre though to be overly critical there's maybe not enough boy on girl action <br /><br />13 EROTIC GHOSTS doesn't take itself too seriously and does contain this memorable exchange : <br /><br />" You know she reminds me of my old Co in 'Nam . Iron underpants we called him " <br /><br />" Maybe we should call her Iron implants ? "
