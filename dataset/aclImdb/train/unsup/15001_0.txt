"The SharkTank Redemption" seemed to indicate that the DVD would contain a humorous spin-off parody of the movie involving sharks trying to escape their tanks at an ocean exhibit. That sounded rather lame, but it's a better plot than what's here.<br /><br />Basically Alfonso Freeman (Morgan's son) works at a Hollywood agency. It's a ruthless place a bit reminiscent of the movie "Swimming with Sharks" - which is ironic, for obvious reasons.<br /><br />A new guy starts working there and receives a lot of criticism from his boss, but he seems able to ignore it. Freeman wants to know how he does this, but it seems Randy (the new employee) just has a way of keeping his cool.<br /><br />Finally Randy snaps, but first he provides his fellow workers in the office environment with a moment of inspiration.<br /><br />Let me get something straight: THIS IS LAME. Really lame. I tried to laugh. I wanted to laugh. But I couldn't. IT'S JUST NOT FUNNY.<br /><br />It has to be just about the lamest idea ever...it was already done in "Swimming with Sharks" and even as a short film it seems dry. In terms of "spoofing" "The Shawshank Redemption" (which is what I had hoped for), all they can come up with are stupid puns on words from the movie, like "Randy" instead of "Andy." The movie's ending is disappointing and just not very funny at all. I suppose if you were a huge "Shawshank" fan you might get something out of this, but for casual viewers, it's just one big (or small, depending upon how you look at it) mess.
