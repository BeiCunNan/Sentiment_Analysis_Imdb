Somewhat of a plodder, but beautifully filmed, James Brolin is an unexpected and welcomed surprise in this "deco" period piece of late 30's, early 40's Hollywood. Jill Clayburgh's portrayal of Lombard is lively albeit somewhat over-acted and strained, though the entire production is first rate with a solid supporting cast. James Brolin definitely nailed Gable's character; that alone makes it worthwhile viewing.
