I saw this movie at Ohio University. I couldn't believe how horrible it was. It was dreadful. Put it this way: it's no different than watching a bunch of high school boys get drunk and make fart jokes. Not funny, not scary, not good. Waste of time! Don't even bother with this mindless adolescent trash. If you really have a desire to watch high school students act like children, then just go to the mall. It's unbelievable that the producers of this movie didn't realize how horrible this is, unless they were children. This sets a poor example for young boys, and most importantly, it is a slap in the face to filmmakers who actually take their work seriously. For a better satire, go watch Monty Python, Mel Brooks, or David Zucker. "Coons" isn't satire, or parody. It's like being in the center of a really bad party. This is not a movie!
