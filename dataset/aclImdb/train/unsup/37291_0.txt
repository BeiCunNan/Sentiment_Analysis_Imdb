I didn't care for this movie. I found myself wishing that the murderous husband would throw himself overboard! He was clearly unhinged. However, the movie's effects were wonderful and there was constant movement throughout. There were also several instances of foreboding-the wife telling the nanny that she won't be back for a while and when the dog breaks free and swims to the boat as if to save the wife. I found the scenes in the city to be spectacular and fun, but here the plot failed me. I didn't feel much towards the characters and didn't see how there interaction made him fall back in love with her. It appeared she loved him all along but he betrayed her trust and apparently won her trust back, that did not seem credible. The cinematography and the presentation were amazing as was the set.
