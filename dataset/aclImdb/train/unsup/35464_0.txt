Makes you wonder how many more times that he can get away with being associated with this type of bad everything that deals with the movie industry. It was obvious that all action (I even think some walking scenes more than 50 feet) we dubbed. He even acted bored with his lines. He was never a favorite or a serious contender for any awards but his movies are normally entertaining to a degree. This movie was a waste of time and money and it was to the point where you started feeling sorry for him. Being a "hasbeen" is nothing anybody desires to face but if he continues trying to be the stud of yesteryear he will frame himself forever as a joke. There is a place for him in action movies he needs to look for it and go in that direction. There is a reason the James Bond character continues to be replaced. Steven should take his cue from that. However, after all is said, I would not desire to read my comments to him eyeball to eyeball.
