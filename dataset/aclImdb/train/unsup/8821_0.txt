This film had powerful acting and the plot was good but some scenes made me angry. Sometimes I think the directors have actors do what they think is acceptable for the film not considering whether it's realistic to the audience. What makes a good film is when it's realistic and everybody reacts in a way the majority would. The lesser complaints the better the film. I have several complaints but like I said, it was worth a watch at home. I could think of films that were ruined completely from being unrealistic, which isn't the case here. Like I said, not a strng ghost story but the plot and storyline was good and the acting was dramatic
