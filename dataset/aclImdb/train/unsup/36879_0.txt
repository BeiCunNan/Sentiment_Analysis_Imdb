When I saw this western on the shelf at the movie store I grabbed it and ran to the counter. A new western, they don't make many of these anymore I said to my self. But as I watched it I realized how really bad it was. You know it's a bad western when all the actors are wearing new clothes like they just walked out of a western clothing store! They all had crisp new clothes and firm hats. Very believable. I love westerns and even I wished it would end! Granted it did have a few good characters like the bad guys at the start (who died early on) and some of the other bad dudes later on. Lucky it was short or did I just block out all the bad scenes making it seem short? The end gun fight was the highlight of this movie!
