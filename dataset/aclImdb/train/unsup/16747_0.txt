Look, before you ask me what the hell I am talking about, let me just get things straight. I love this show. I watch it whenever I feel down to cheer me up and it never fails to do this. But I like (or used to like) The Simpsons more and arguably the reason it went downhill after the end of the 90's was because FOX moved the good writers to Futurama, and therefore killing The Simpsons in the process. So, before I sat down and started to watch this show, I told myself 'this better be good' and my God was it GOOD. This has everything: science fiction, comedy, animation that makes you go 'wow', amazing characters, a good story and even some action. Cancelling this and the other show from the same team (The Critic) were the two biggest mistakes FOX has ever made. I just wish FOX were the people who picked it up again instead of freaking' Comedy Central. For some reason, Futurama is nowhere as good when Comedy Central makes it. (The movies were awful, admittedly) But whatever the case, I am still so pleased that it is finally coming back. Sure hope Comedy Central gets it right this time around. They sure owe it to us fans after those four terrible movies.
