I think if this movie had a bigger budget, it would have been really great. The concept is good, the acting and shooting is typical "B" rated movie, its better than most low budget movies, and would be an amazing blockbuster with the right people. Worth the rent, if you have one of those pay by the month things, instead of individual movie prices. FYI - My "8 of 10" is with the knowledge that it is a rating for a B movie. I think the good witch looks amazingly like Ali Larter, but I can't confirm that, and they take death in real stride. The acting was totally unrealistic. Its very Blair witch, and there is a time loop kind of thing happening. You wonder who "athena" is, and why she is important. It needed more story. It did not actually show any people really doing anything, which was very Alfred Hitchcockian of the director.
