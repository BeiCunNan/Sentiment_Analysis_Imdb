Struggled to stay awake during the picture...typical VanDisel, but he's done much better in the past.<br /><br />Had to many unanswered questions on why things happened the way they did in this picture. Also ended with a question whether or not there will be a continuation --- hopefully not.<br /><br />Wondered why the picture started with such a hard line and a tough guy but ended entirely opposite which spoiled the VanDisel image in my opinion.<br /><br />For futuristic, it didn't look much like it, scenery was second class and nothing spectacular about it.<br /><br />Hopefully the next VanDisel picture will be a lot better and more like his XXX pictures which is what he's known for.
