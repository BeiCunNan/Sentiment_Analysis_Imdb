I knew about this film long before I saw it. In fact, I had to buy the DVD in order to see it because no video store carried it. I didn't mind spending the $12 to buy it used because I collect off the wall movies. The new limited edition double DVD has great sound and visually not bad. I found myself laughing much more then<br /><br />jolting in fear, although there were a few scenes were I was startled.<br /><br />If you enjoy off the wall 70s sci-fi/horror movies, you probably will eat this one up. I was a little dissapointed at how abrubtly it ended. I wanted the movie to keep going, see how things pan out. The DVD revolution has brought so many<br /><br />lost clasics back to life, it is truly wonderful. Blue Sunshine is one of those lost "missing links" of the cinema. Enjoy!
