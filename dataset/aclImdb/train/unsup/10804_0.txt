I hated this, it reminded me of some made for TV horror movie, it was that bad. The makeup for the creature was super cheap looking and the werewolf jokes were stupid and unfunny. This movie failed in both departments of horror and comedy. Big Bad Wolf made me yearn for a true B class horror movie which would have been a big step up for this mess, it was like a lousy TV movie that looked like it was made on the cheap in a couple of days. The actors were obviously there for a paycheck and to get through it as quickly as possible. Who can blame them, certainly no one who read the script beforehand. The special effects were lame, the plot absurd, with no suspense or one decent scare. As I was watching it what came to mind was this would be a good candidate for that show where they would lampoon the worst science fiction and horror movies made. At least then this movie would have some entertainment value. Barring that Big Bad Wolf is another example of low-grade movie making in the horror genre.
