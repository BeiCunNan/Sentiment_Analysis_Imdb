This movie had to be the single worst example of a manga/anime-to-movie transition to ever come into existence. NOTHING about this flaming pile of dung was good.<br /><br />We had a hairy white guy with a Japanese name (who was SUPPOSEDLY the master of the Hokuto Shinken martial art) who could barely land a decent punch on his goofy and wholly ineffectual enemies, another hairy white guy (who was SUPPOSEDLY a master of the Nanto Koshuken form of the Nanto Seiken martial art) who, as was mentioned in a previous comment, fought like a common street thug and sported a hilariously stupid accent, a Japanese lady who couldn't speak a lick of English and had to read cue cards written in her native language to struggle through all of her scenes (all 0.015 of them), a total switch around of the Hokuto no Ken characters and canon, acting bad enough to strip the paint from a wall, the most mind-numbingly fake movie sets in the history of the universe, and a less-than-healthy dosage of regurgitated "mystic oriental proverbs" courtesy of Ryuken (which of course made absolutely NO sense whatsoever).<br /><br />A complete and utter bastardization.<br /><br />And even if I hadn't seen this lame-assed movie with the knowledge of its origin, I would've still given it a failing grade. The fight scenes were laughable, the plot razor thin (without the campy goodness from the anime and manga that made it fun), the actors wooden and unconvincing, and the enjoyment null and void.<br /><br />There were no good points to this film. Absolutely none. It's a failure of the highest degree and its existence should be removed from all human memory.
