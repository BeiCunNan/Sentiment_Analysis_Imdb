Poorly acted, directed and written, "The Conrad Boys" is barely watchable. The main problem is Justin Lo, who assumes the role of writer, director, film editor and principal actor. Lo does not handle any one of his jobs well; his ability to create a believable character on film is seriously lacking. Watching Lo is akin to watching a beginning actor with no idea of what he is doing or saying. The script is quite clich√©d and lacks any real imagination. The two stars I awarded this are solely for Nick Bartzen who is quite good as the young drifter, Jordan Rivers. <br /><br />This film is to be avoided.
