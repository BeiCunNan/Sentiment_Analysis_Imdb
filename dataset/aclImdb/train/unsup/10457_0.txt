This film portrays a few interesting weeks in the life of a suburban New York slacker. Any five minutes taken out of context would lead one to believe the movie is full of mundane humor. However, this movie as a whole asks some deep questions and believably portrays members of the suburban working class. At the end of it you're left wondering how close you've come to the predicaments Buscemi's character invites. Or perhaps you empathize more with people you've know who are like him and others in the film.
