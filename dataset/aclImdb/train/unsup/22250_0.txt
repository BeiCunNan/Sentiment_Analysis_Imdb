I must wonder to tell you the truth because when it comes to a night out with the great (Marilyn Monroe), and a chance to kiss her too ..HHHHOOO this is wild man..Very wild.. So when they made it as something which's less enjoyable than the ordinary life.. I've got to veto and in a hard way too ! <br /><br />But come to think of it, as the movie's point of view is so interesting : the friendship with humans lives longer than the other with the stars, as reality is more honest and amusing than movies.. Hmmm... Try to imagine that !.<br /><br />The boy here discovered that the cinematic dream, even if it was as incredibly fantastic as (Marilyn) herself, is just a dream. So all the rest of our silly, foolish, and risky actual life is more fantastic because we actually lived it. Even if it contained some nightmares already ! Hence the jam in the phone booth with a girl you want becomes eventually more important than a lively fantasy you may live like the movie fulfills indeed - with your own calendar girl.<br /><br />This movie made too many regards which are truly full of love and longing to a lot of things : the adolescence's folly, the friendship's coolest memories, the pure fondness of a movie star, the fiery sexy yet innocent days of the late 1950s and the early 1960s, the good old Hollywood, and lastly the utmost sex icon ..The shiniest star yet.. (Marilyn Monroe). She was portrayed here as sad lonely woman, missing what these young men already have : the friendship, who dies with the beauty of that era and the end of those guys' minority too; as if this time was the adolescence's climax of America itself before Vietnam, the series of assassinations, the hippie revelation.. etc.<br /><br />I loved the whole deal : the nice comedy, the good characterization, the performance from all the young bunch, the bright cinematography, and the atmosphere which was in low budget but so solid, look at the details to know how it's a sincere adorer movie for what it speaks about (the clever wicked opening credits, the bits of Marilyn's movies or photos, the soundtrack's songs.. etc). It got a "real" sentimental script and directing.<br /><br />Although the face of (Stéphanie Anderson) as (Marilyn) didn't appear on screen like a high too glaring to watch phantasm, but truly she delivered by her voice and body a fine performance. Still the part of the kiss is such a magical cinematic moment and one of the most immortal kisses I've ever seen as well, not only because its achievement of what any fan of (Marilyn) dreamed of (getting a special kiss from her) but also because it was one unforgettable hot kiss in so colorfully sensual close up. In brief it was as madly sexy as any of Marilyn's kisses yet more emotional and a bit lamentably moving. <br /><br />It's one comic so passionate movie which has no shame in presenting this obligatory phase of life when you've got to know your dream so consequently your fact !, and what a lessen the movie gives softly through its gentle manifesto : viva the 1950s, (Marilyn), the boyhood, the fictional world, and the most of all : viva the genius experiment of factual LIFE.
