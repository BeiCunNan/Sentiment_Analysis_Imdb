Normally I am not much for any movie that features an animal and as a result I avoided watching this movie as long as I could. However, since my grand daughter and my wife watched it over and over for months it was inevitable that I would be exposed to it. What a joy. To my surprise it was a parody, and a clever one at that. Once I realized the film was a spoof and being played for laughs I couldn't stop laughing. The well written script and hilarious sight gags make this fun for adults and children. However, I do have one complaint about the writing. Why was the limited profanity in the script? It adds nothing to the movie and worst of all is not funny. I can't believe that a guy like me who likes "Pulp Fiction" would be making this complaint, but without the needless profanity this is a perfect family movie. Profanity aside "Bingo" is a hoot.
