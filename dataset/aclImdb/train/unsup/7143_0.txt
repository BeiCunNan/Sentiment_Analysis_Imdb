To start off with, it's bad enough the heroes of the movies are a bunch of blood thirsty criminals. But the whole thing barely makes any sense. Seven monks brought some treasure over, but are they good monks or bad monks? A little more back story on the monks and why the brought this treasure over would have been nice and what about the town? Where did these people come from, since it started with a mere 7? What were these blood sucking monsters supposed to be? Mummies? Vampires? What? If they were mummies they didn't look like mummies and I never heard of blood sucking mummies and if they vampires, then why were they running around during broad daylight? Plus, the title characters, the seven mummies didn't make an appearance to like ten minutes before the end of the film. How lame is that, plus is Drake suppose to be one of the seven monks, because they never said. Finally, the final insult, without giving it away, the climax of the film makes no sense. A complete and total waste of time. THE RASBERRY.
