My Super Sweet Sixteen is a show where rich soon-to-be 16 year olds get the party of their dreams. This show has been panned by critics for "over the top materialism" and I would have to agree.<br /><br />I think it's one of the worst shows on MTV and there's been some pretty bad MTV shows. The show is about spoiled kids who get whatever they want, but wait-not only do they show the good parts of being a total spoiled brat, they also show so-called "drama" in planning the perfect sweet sixteen party. These kids seemed like their party is ruined if they get a performer that no one's ever heard of or if Rihanna shows up late to escort them to the party.<br /><br />Not only that, but their parents seem perfectly willing to spend a ton of money on their parties. Someone on the show even said that their parents spent more on their party then on the parents wedding! It seems like this kids have no appreciation of their parents or even realize how lucky they are because they are only part of a small minority who can actually afford Sweet Sixteen parties like theirs or their parents want to spend so much money.<br /><br />For a show that stresses over the top materialism and laughs in the face who are less privileged I rate this show 1/10
