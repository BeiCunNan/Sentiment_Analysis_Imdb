I remembered when this movie came out back in the late 90's. I never paid much attention to it, but when I saw it was going to be on HBO, I DVRed it. I finally got around to watching it, and several times throughout the movie I had to refrain from stopping it and deleting it. I figured, this has to get better at some point.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong...<br /><br />I got up several times during the movie, to let the dog out, grab something to eat, and didn't even bother to pause it. I had such a disinterest in it that I didn't even want to be bothered by hitting the pause button.<br /><br />This was the biggest pantload of a movie I've ever seen. How many mummies were in this movie? Was there one, or 12? The story line was awful. What happened at the end? Hell, what was going on through the whole movie!!?? Was the kid in the beginning of the movie supposed to be Louis Gosset Jr? <br /><br />Take some ancient Egyptian artifacts, an old unconscious bag of bones (not the mummy, the old man in the movie), a $3 throw away version of Christian Bale (Eric Lutes), complete nonsense, and the contents of an unflushed toilet, mix them together, and there you have the gist of this movie.<br /><br />From beginning to end this movie made zero sense, was poorly scripted, and the acting was worse than imaginable. Al from Home Improvement really put the final nail in the sarcophagus.
