"Marmalade Wine" a two person teleplay introduces us to a weary hiker caught in a rainstorm and a friendly country doctor who offers the young man refuge in the storm, only to have a truly grisly ulterior motive. The sets are really threadbare, (Not sure if that was the intention or not) but the acting is good. The doctor is very creepy and really adds to the suspense here. The ending is a stomach churning revelation which is great. When you put yourself in theyoung man's shoes, you almost feel faint. <br /><br />If you've seen the Twilight Zone episode entitled "The Howling Man" you'll see a few similarities. A man who with an evil secret figure in both stories. A fun and shocking episode.
