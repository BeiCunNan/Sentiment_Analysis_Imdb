By now we have grown accustomed to multiple story lines. Not only that, we seem to be expecting a bit more from these type of movies. Whenever a director starts on such a project, he knows it is going to be compared with the likes of PULP FICTION or 21 GRAMS. Unfair perhaps, but a challenge. SURVIVE STYLE 5+ is unique in the fact that it does not give the viewer time to compare. It is a roller-coaster ride from start to finish and there are only a few moments to catch your breath. Central figure is a man who is trying to kill his wife, but fails miserably and hires a foreign hit-man (Vinnie Jones). Then there's a happy family that visits a show from an arrogant hypnotist, a woman that has crazy commercial ideas and a bunch of friends that cause disaster wherever they go. They all cross paths off course, but not in a genius kind of way. Sekiguchi clearly made this film to entertain and in that it succeeds brilliantly. It is the most hilarious movie since THE BIG LEBOWSKY.
