As a big fan of zombie movies and B-horror, I have come to expect enormous plot holes, sub-par editing, hard-not-to-laugh-at acting, and poor dialog. With these in mind I purchased Zombie Night from my local DVD/CD shop for 4$, why not add to the collection? What I didn't expect was that the acting would be SO bad that I would feel almost embarrassed watching and listening to these characters interact in the film. The dialog and actors leave you to believe they were selected minutes before the shooting and given no script as they make quite a few mistakes. Shouldn't they edit those out? <br /><br />Additionally. the editing here was downright confusing. In one scene a couple is listening to the radio on their car stereo and when the girl reaches to turn it up... the scene cuts to live news broadcasts on a television highlighting the zombie uprising before cutting back to the pair in the car discussing the "magical" TV broadcasts? The cause of the outbreak is practically left to the imagination. Something about WW3 causing nuclear fallout which in turn is causing people to rise from death as flesh hungry zombies? <br /><br />A couple scenes of nice gore including an excellent shotgun blast to the leg and a decent bit of gut munching simply weren't enough save Zombie Night from the ABYSMAL dialog, editing, and acting. Overall, a good rental for the die-hard zombie fan or something to pop on if your looking for a laugh-at-with-your-friends style horror flick.
