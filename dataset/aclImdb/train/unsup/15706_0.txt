I found this film to be a disappointing and confusing adaptation of a lovely book. The book is quite long and involved, so I was looking forwards to see which threads were omitted to make the film. Actually, most of the book is included in the film, but so superficially that much of the meaning is lost. Sort of spoiler coming up now... The sense of "the incident" between Cassandra's parents is completely altered from the book, and there is a brand new and utterly ludicrous scene between Cassandra and her father, which implies that the person adapting the book hadn't actually read it properly.<br /><br />If you've read and enjoyed the book, I suggest you avoid the film. If you've watched and enjoyed the film, I suggest you avoid the book.
