Haunting, powerful, extremely well directed and acted, a real sleeper that should have been nominated for awards seeing the crap that mostly is nominated now days. Forget Kinski; she's a throwaway part and is the only jarring note to this movie; crass commercialism where they fool you by paying some well-known name-brand has been to pop up and do basically a "cameo". The music is perfect, and haunting, the location sets perfect, the subject, the Bosnia-Herzogovina-Serbia war fascinating and the effort by the director not to take too obvious a side makes the film perfect. Grown men will cry, women will weep copiously and little children have nightmares for life.
