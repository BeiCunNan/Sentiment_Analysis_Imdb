When I was a kid I saw a promo for A Kid in King Arthur's Court and got really excited for it but when I actually sat down to see it didn't make much of a impression on me and for the most part I forgot it. A Kid in King Arthur's Court is a film with unoriginal and uninspired dialogue, a lame plot, and jokes that only make you want to laugh at how stupid they are. (I guess that's better then jokes that don't make you laugh at all) Along with Blank Check and The Pagemaster this movie seems to have fallen into obscurity and I doubt it will be remembered during the 00s. If you somehow get your hands on a copy of this film I recommend that you put it back where you found it.
