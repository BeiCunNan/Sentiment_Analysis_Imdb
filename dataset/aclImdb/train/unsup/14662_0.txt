Now i know what your thinking, that you have seen many of these shark movies before and that they all look the same. yes this movie had the same feel like the other shark films did, but thats what was partly so good about this film, i will add though that it did have a twist. As well as killer sharks they had an alien plot and an assassin twist to it so that made the film the same as the others but also a little bit different at the same time. Another thing that i like about this film was that there station wasn't just some office at a beach location, and it was under the ocean. Yes that wasn't really believable but it was part of the fantasy of the film. This film like most other films should never be taken seriously but just looked as an adventure, just enjoy it. Also if your a B grade film lover then raging sharks is right up your ally.
