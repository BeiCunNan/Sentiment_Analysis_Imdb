Comedy GOLD. I don't want to give any false notions by assigning a higher rating because this movie is truly bad. But it's bad in a good way! A few Dare-You-Not-To-Laugh moments: 1) When the guy in the pig mask shows up. 2) When the female lead does her little dance in front our hero while he works out. 3) The fight in the parking garage where the hero takes out a whole group of guys with what looks like a plastic broom handle.<br /><br />Rest assured there are plenty more moments of unintentional hilarity, but these you must discover for yourself. The only thing more hilarious is the fact that there is apparently a sequel. I'll have to track that one down. Bad movie fans rejoice!
