When I saw the DVD standing in the store, I though,finally a movie about WWI, with Danile Craigh and it will be showing us the story of the first big push during the first great war.... NOT, it was more of a school play, and a very boring one. The movie stays in the trench, or shall I say a very obvious indoor set and even the actors make up is badly done. One actor looks more like the unknown guy of "Wham". Please don't wake me up before you go go, but just let me sleep through the whole movie. If you want to see a very good WWI movie, the last battalion will do the job. How this one ever got a rating of more tan 6 ? It blows my mind. All I can say is, I want my 6.95 euro's back that I spend on this terrible movie! Any buyers :o) ?
