Bottom line is, if you like Coen Brothers movies, you'll likely enjoy The Brothers Bloom. I'm not implying TBB is a Coen Brothers rip-off, simply that it fits within that genre, whatever that genre actually is.<br /><br />The film is very funny and enjoyable through most of it. Some of the early scenes between Adrien Brody and Rachel Weisz are sidesplitting. And let's face it, Rachel Weisz is an absolutely adorable actress and person. Any film with her in it is going to bolster its rating on that fact alone, and she delivers the goods too.<br /><br />However, TBB has some big misses as well. We're introduced to characters without really getting to know anything about them, why they are there and what real relationship they have with the Bloom brothers. Despite the fact that they are very obviously important to the brothers and the story both.<br /><br />Some of the scenes were overly melodramatic for the initial lightheartedness of the film as well. Adrien Brody's character was a little too tortured by morality and self-angst to be believable or enjoyable, considering the life he has chosen for himself. This, despite having an epiphany two thirds of the way through the film which really could have opened his character up, but sadly didn't. It fell completely flat leaving you wondering why they even left it in the film in the first place. Much of the film leaves you feeling this way.<br /><br />But despite this, The Brothers Bloom is still a very enjoyable movie. It's faults are easy enough to overlook if you just want to enjoy a movie for its cinematic eye-candy, a good cast, and some very funny scenes. A solid 7/10.
