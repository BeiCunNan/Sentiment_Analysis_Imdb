As a Nam vet and former combat infantry squad leader I can tell you this movie was 80% BS. As commented on by others we don't build permanent camps in the middle of the jungle. Camps are built in areas where clear fields of fire can be created so that daylight surprise attacks like the one depicted in the movie cannot happen. There also were no jeeps riding down two tracks in the jungle, for the same obvious reason. There are so many factual errors in this flick like uni's, incorrect armaments, a unit insignia that I've never seen before, etc, etc, etc. The director obviously had no knowledge of what went on in Vietnam and he didn't bother to find out by bringing in a knowledgeable technical consultant. This movie is without question the worst Vietnam era movie ever made and one of the worst war movies of all time. The shame of it is that there is a truly gripping story to be told about guys who volunteered to be tunnel rats in the Nam and this flick failed miserably to tell that story. What's worse is from what I see on this website, far too many of you think this was some kind of representative and half way decent movie. Nothing could be further from the truth. And FYI, there were no 6 foot and 6 foot plus tunnel rats as depicted in the movie. Tunnel rats by necessity were the shortest guys who more approximated the size of the people who built and used the tunnels.
