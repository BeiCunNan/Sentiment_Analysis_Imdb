I want that 99 minutes of my life back, this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. If you know about movies, you'd know this garbage is a waste of film. There is no dialog, no structure, no plot, no climax, NO NOTHING. This movie was all over the place and it was complete trash, The best character in the movie was SHLOMO, "Stewart" he only had 2 minutes in the movie. This movie is Jewish propaganda and it's trash, I felt like hugging Jews after i saw this movie. If anybody compares this movie to "American History X" they deserve to be shot and strangled. "American History X" is a very well written movie thats has a moral to the story, This Movie "the believer" on the other hand was complete trash. It didn't make any sense what so ever, Take my advice and don't waste your life watching this piece of garbage movie. I rather stick a knife in my stomach for entertainment, rather than touch this movie with a 10 foot poll. TRASH TRASH TRASH.
