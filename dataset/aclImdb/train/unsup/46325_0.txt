Okay, this flick has a lot against it. Bad acting, bad script, bad directing, low, very low budget and more junk than I can name. But there are a few things going for this movie, that make it not totally painful to watch. Some of the jokes are funny. And the lead isn't played to badly by Michael McGaham. And unlike some low budget features, it doesn't try to be what it isn't. And that's good. This movies sucks, and they all know it. They're not trying to make anything of any substance of any kind. But it's still hard over look many of the mistakes here, so I can't give it a rating higher than a 2. But that's a big deal, since I've never even thought about giving a Troma film anything higher than a 1. So if you're in the mood for stupid, dumb (dumber than "Dumb & Dumber) comedy, than check this little flick out.
