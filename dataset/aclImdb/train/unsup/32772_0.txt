I respect the fact that this film was made in a mature way, since movies with lesbian characters often contain silly jokes or numerous stereotypes. Unfortunately, that's the best thing I can say about this picture. Despite obviously good intentions, this film is just plain dull. There's not a person that I cared about, not a scene that was particularly interesting. It was a movie that I wanted to like, but it didn't take long for me to get VERY bored.
