Oh, what high expectations I had. Fifteen minutes into this, I knew I was in for an exceptionally long two hours. I, personally, have researched as much as I possibly could on the case long before the movie came out...and the only thing that actually lived up to true drama of the real events was the crime scene. It was very accurate...but that's all that is going for this film. Throughout, you simply become bored to tears. Most of the time, I was left confused and often amused by the overacting. There are still parts that I can't understand or don't see the significance. The film did not GO anywhere up until the very end, and even the dramatic parts weren't very exciting. This movie had nothing to draw you in, and by the end it leaves one feeling unsatisfied. The Black Dahlia definitely could have been done so much better then it was, it was all just a jumbled mess.
