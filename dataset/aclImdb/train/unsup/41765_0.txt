Veddy British, veddy dull horror film. Mia Farrow is a very frail, timid woman who moves to a very large, built to be haunted house after her daughter dies and, surprise, it turns out to be haunted by a young blond girl who (gasp) looks just like her daughter!! The acting is bland and one note save for Tom Conti as Mia's brother-in-law and a bit part by Robin Gammell as a drunk with a "very big secret". The score is atrocious. The cinematography is gorgeous but it certainly doesn't help any. The book that it's based on "Julia" by Peter Straub is only slightly more interesting. For a good old fashioned ghost story from the same era, rent "The Changeling" with George C. Scott.
