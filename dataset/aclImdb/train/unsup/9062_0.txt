I saw the film because a friend has recommended it very much to me six weeks ago and since that time she convinced me to see it. I couldn't have gone to the movies but every week I had in mind to see it and when I saw it at last there was many people and it continues for the same reason, people is still interested about this film.<br /><br />As I have wrote, I like very much the performance of Andy Garcia, I saw him in other two films but now that he is the principal in this movie I think that he should have more opportunities. The young actors are good in this thriller and the story seems to me very interesting.
