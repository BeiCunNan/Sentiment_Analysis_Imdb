Uggghhh!!!! This is one of several Looney Toons cartoons that were shelved decades back due to their strongly racist content. And while SOME of them are actually highly offensive BUT well-made, this one is a bore even if it weren't full of racial stereotypes. For some of these offensive cartoons, I have recommended people watch them--particularly for their historical value. However, this one has really nothing to recommend it--being a long cartoon with nothing but stupid music and very, very big-lipped Black characters acting,...well,...STUPID! So, the film is offensive, poorly made and not particularly entertaining--everything you'd like in a cartoon, huh?! (this is sarcasm, by the way)
