I was a senior in high school when Footloose was released. I tripped through the hallways with everyone else singing "Let's Hear It For The Boy" because it was on the radio eighty-four thousand times a day. I agree with almost every other reviewer here with the exception of those few who spoke harshly. Cheesy at times? Yes! Never liked Bonnie Tyler. Issues like those can make this film make you squirm a little.<br /><br />However, no other film of my youth has affected me to this day as this one has. What did it? Compare... "You think I'm small town?" "I think Bomont's a small town." "I'm going' away...I'm gonna be gone... Wanna see somethin'?" Listen to the background music as this scene unfolds. The violin, piano and soulful rock guitar are wed beautifully. Miles Goodman adapted the score so I'm giving him credit for this still mega-emotion stirring theme music. Then, as Ren tells the town "This is our time to dance," well, it still brings a tear of joy and hope. And the background music gives Kevin Bacon's character a rock to stand upon as he gives his speech. Then, there are the snowcapped mountains and sweeping farm valleys that drew me in. The kids, the story, the religious oppression (I'm truly from the Bible Belt where there are no snowcapped mountains) and most of the music all make this film one that I will watch until I'm old and gray, and no longer have the strength to say "I'm gonna be gone." P.S. My beloved husband won't watch this with me because he can't quit cringing at the 80's music. He's from Seattle.:)
