As the paramour of John F. Kennedy and Sam Giancana, Judith Campbell Exner had enough goods to bring down the Kennedy family and the Presidency itself. But, you'd never know it by this. What should have been a hum-dinger was a snooze, our "heroine" whining to her wuss of a boyfriend to order the FBI to stop camping outside her house and barging in whenever they felt like it. The dialog was a hoot: when Judy wails "I want to be with you. I want to go to a soda fountain and drink vanilla Cokes!," I couldn't stop laughing!<br /><br />Judy tells us about her "mistakes," as if she's been kicking herself over them, only to say that she doesn't regret a thing! Why was Giancana - here, the kindest mobster ever - crazy about her? There certainly isn't anything about her that justified such puppy-eyed devotion.<br /><br />Exner's last years were bittersweet: she was reconciled with the infant son she gave up for adoption, and some of her story was verified. However, like the other good-time girls before and since, her 15 minutes clearly lasted 14 minutes too long.
