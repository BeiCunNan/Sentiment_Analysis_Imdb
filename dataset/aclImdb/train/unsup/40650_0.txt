Standard, typical tear-jerker - highly-renowned concerto artist deserts family to take off with his child's piano teacher. <br /><br />They cavort around Europe until she finally throws him out and resumes her music career.<br /><br />The ladies in the audience use up three handkerchiefs apiece with their weeping. <br /><br />The men wonder at the idiot male who gives up the luscious Bergman to return to sleep with his wife who is stupid enough to take him back.<br /><br />The plot is straight out of East Lynne and told dozens of times on stage and in screen. Two star-crossed lovers finally come to their senses when they are reminded about the lives they are ruining with their carrying-ons. <br /><br />So they cry on each others shoulders and go their separate ways. <br /><br />A stinker of a movie.
