this has got to be the worst film i have ever seen! some say its a horror, I've seen more scarier things in my bin, than in this film. there was no suspense, no horror no plot! i had no sympathy for any of the characters,it was bad acting, directing, and writing! so the idea that this could really happen, was plausible, apart from that, there's nothing.<br /><br />the reviews in the UK said 'the twist is so good you don't see it coming' the fact that they point out there is a twist means that there is no twist, you see it coming a mile away! thats not a twist! please please please save your money, rent it if you want but do not go and pay to see this movie, you will regret it! 2.5 hours of my life i will never get back!
