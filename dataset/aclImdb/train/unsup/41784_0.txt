I am a huge Monkees fan, from the time I was a toddler (I was 1 when the show premiered). I've seen every episode, read books, own box sets--you get the picture. I was excited when I saw that VH1 was going to air this movie, and kept an open mind while watching, knowing that no biopic ever gets it all right, and since I know more about the subject than the average viewer, I didn't want to judge too harshly. This one was definitely a mixed bag, a mostly disappointing one.<br /><br />The movie wouldn't have been too bad, except for the ending--sooooo goofily bad! And why waste time re-doing segments from the show, particularly the entire "Daydream Believer" video? Plus, combining the creators into one guy was weird. The cast was pretty good, though, especially the actor who played Mike.<br /><br />It's fine to watch if you're killing time and happen upon it on TV. It's just not one worth making an effort to see.
