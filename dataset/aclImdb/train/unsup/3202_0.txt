I can honestly say I've been a "Quatermass" fan most of my life. Ever since I saw "Quatermass Xperiment" at age eight(shown in the U.S. as "The Creeping Unknown"), I've seen and enjoyed almost all available versions of the series. If I say that this version is the weakest of the bunch, that's no slam, not at all! The acting was first-rate, the adaption nearly so; the only flaw here is one that almost everyone on the site mentions--the production budget. If BBC 4 needs a benchmark of how little money they can get away with spending to make a good SF thriller, this is the breaker. Even a brief look at the metamorphosed Caroon in the museum would been better than what we were supposed to have seen over the television monitors(that was fiberglass insulation being shaken by off-camera grips, to portray the "alien fungi", right? In soft-focus? That was pretty sad). To quote the late, great Casey Stengel, "Eventually, you've got to sell some steak along with the sizzle!" I hope that when they re-make "Quatermass 2", they give it a *slightly* bigger budget. Hell, I know _I'd_ watch it.
