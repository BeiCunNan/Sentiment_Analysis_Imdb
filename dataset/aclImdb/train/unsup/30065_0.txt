DiCaprio fever seems to have obscured the worth of this film on its own merits. His celebrity seems to have overshadowed and killed serious criticism of this film, I believe. If "Lord of the Flies" is seen as a reference, I think a case can be made that this film makes some very powerful and effective statements about classic Utopianism among the children of the jaded and bored richer classes. DiCaprio plays his spoiled American very well. The young man is a great actor. The role of Tilda Swinton is well written, but I think she made her character too intelligent and complex with her excellent, but intense, acting. The jockish and superficial tribe members were much more convincing. I loved the international casting. The cast and the setting are visual knock outs. Robert Carlyle brought his "Trainspotting" insanity to the film, but I think his character was written over the top. Paterson Joseph, as Keaty, was a stand out. Guillame Canet, as Etienne, worked well as the tortured cast off in his particular love triangle. It took two viewings of this film for me to see past its stunning visuals and over-the-top highs and lows to appreciate it for its intelligent themes. If you disliked it the first time, you might give it another try.
