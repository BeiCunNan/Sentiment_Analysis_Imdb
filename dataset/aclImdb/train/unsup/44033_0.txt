This is the worst Troma movie I have ever seen and I normally love Troma films. The pace of this movie is that of a snail. The violence/gore is too sparse and VERY badly done (there is a scene of a stabbing where you can clearly see that the knife is just thrust to the left of the victim), with the exception of a couple of death sequences. The scene progression is often non-linear. The dialogue is boring, and unfortunately it takes up far too much of the film. This film had a very low budget and it shows. I often wondered while watching this movie, if they even auditioned the child actors (most were terrible at their job). The ending, however, is pretty good and totally unexpected. If I ever see this movie again it will be for the ending and/or attempting to understand some of the references and concepts displayed in the film's dialogue.<br /><br />Not recommended, even for most Troma fans.
