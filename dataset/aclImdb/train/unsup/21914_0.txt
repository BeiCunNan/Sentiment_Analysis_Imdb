Another western with a message for all those who understand that money may buy all things in the world. Lancaster played the role of a Chicano town constable, not much respected in his county. Due to a mistake of others he killed a black person who had an Indian wife. Understanding that this Indian wife had nothing left to survive Valdez (Lancaster) tried to get some money for her. Everybody thought he was stupid man unable to defend himself. After several serious offenses against him, he decided to show his real face and started a fight against Mr Tanner and his gang. The end of the film showed that Mexicans (Chicanos) like to fight one against another and not a group vs one. The gang refused to go over Valdez, and his boss, Tanner, was compelled to face Valdez alone.
