Of course this was one these movies your girlfriend make you sit through, which, normally, is ok. Normally they aren't this flat and usually these films is more determined at which genre it's going for. This film starts of with the prospect of a Romantic drama, sprinkled with some comedy here and there, which would have been ok. The setup is of course obvious, but there might have been some interesting things to show had it been allowed to continue that course. To me it seems as if this film is being instructed by two VERY different directors, because the depiction of Alabama population in the last 2/3 of the movie reminds me most of all of cartoon characters rather then actual homo sapiens. This way to go would also have been fine if it had been taken all the way, in stead of betting on two horses like this. Had the movie gone for either the farce or the drama, I'd probably have given it a 5/10, but it didn't - it mixed up the two and got a cocktail of boring and flat out failure. 3/10
