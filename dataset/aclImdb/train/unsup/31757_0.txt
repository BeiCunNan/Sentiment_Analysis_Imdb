I knew that the lead actress won the Razzie for Worst Actress, but I didn't realise she won it twice, or that the critics give it three out of five stars, which I think is nonsense. Basically Aubrey Fleming (twice Razzie winning and nominated Lindsay Lohan) is a regular high school girl who disappears one night, we see her violently tortured, having an arm and leg severed, and she is found unconscious in the woods. When she wakes she has forgotten her identity, thinking she is a Dakota Moss, a stripper she created for an English assignment, so she is denying her supposed identity. "Dakota" is now trying to unravel the mystery of her identity, how she and Aubrey co-exist, and the person/people who abducted her. In the end, after finding out she is in fact a twin, she finds her other self buried alive. Okay, I'll be honest, I confused after about half an hour, so I can't be accurate about the full plot. Also starring Razzie nominated Julia Ormond as Susan Fleming, Neal McDonough as Daniel Fleming, Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon as Agent Julie Bascome, Spencer Garrett as Agent Phil Lazarus, Gregory Itzin as Dr. Greg Jameson and Eddie Steeples as Saeed the Prosthetic Tech. The only reason I have given it an extra star out of ten is because of the quite inventive gore scenes, other than that it confused the hell out of me, and Lohan may be have a hot body, but she and the film as a whole are terrible. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Director for Chris Sivertson, Worst Excuse for a Horror Movie, Worst Remake or Rip-Off (ripping off Hostel and Saw), Worst Screen Couple for Lohan as the twins, Worst Screenplay and Worst Picture of the Decade. Pretty poor!
