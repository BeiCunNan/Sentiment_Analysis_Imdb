It is the most patient film I have ever seen! <br /><br />Very deliberate, which makes the viewer have to use his imagination rather than have others tell her how to feel, think, etc. <br /><br />I kept waiting for the dialogue, acting, scenery, whatever, to create my next feeling or thought and then I realized that I was doing so on my own. That was remarkable. <br /><br />The mystery of the hitchhiker and his dog still bewitches me. So many meanings that all seem right. <br /><br />The driver; he is all of us at one time or another.<br /><br />I recommend this short to everyone.
