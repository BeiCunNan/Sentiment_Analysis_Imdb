This had to be the worst Wesley Snipes flick of all time. Truly a waste of money. It hurts me to say this, because I'm a hardcore Wesley Snipes fan. I think the plot of this movie was trash. The park scene was the funniest; watch out for that scene other than that it was garbage. Wesley Snipes used a stunt man to perform a kick, since when does he use a stunt man to kick, I know Wesley isn't that old. True disappointment. Oh and by the way did I mention this movie was garbage? Wesley Snipes barely threw a punch in the whole movie, he mostly was on the run, using guns, but barely any hand to hand combat. I didn't see the The Detonator yet, but I'm kind of scared to after seeing this movie. I guess Wesley Snipes really needs the money. I hope Snipes can start making movies that actually hits the theaters, but for now, he's a straight to DVD actor. He is coming out with a movie this year, a horror/western called Gallowwalker. It's about a gunman being cursed, now he has to fight all of his enemies that died by his hands, only this time they're already dead. Sounds better than Unstoppable, I really hope it is. Wesley needs to step up his career; I'm fighting this fight with Wesley Snipes though, but I don't know how long this fight is going to last. I advise you to watch this movie only if you have nothing else better to watch on T.V.
