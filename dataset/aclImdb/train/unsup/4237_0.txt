The film is probably the finest example of a gay cinema I can think of. The production values aside, this movies shines because of a simple plot, appropriate music and an outstanding lead cast.<br /><br />JUDITH LIGHT!!!! Wow. There is no question now about Who's the Boss! Judith gives a powerful performance that I never thought possible from a SITCOM escapee. After watching this film, I immediately hopped onto IMDb hoping to see that she'd been recognized for her acting in this film. Sadly, she has not been. The woman deserves an award. It's a tragedy that a little loved film such as this doesn't get the audience it deserves. <br /><br />As opposed to a "good gay movie" this is just a great film where some of the characters happen to be gay.<br /><br />I loved this film. I can only hope for more like it.
