Very boring and stupid. I fell asleep several times (but kept on being awoke by my constant nightmares). Summed up in one word, this film is crap! Why is it crap? Because they're is too much talking, and often just say the same kind of stuff that's already been said. Characters are seen to have amazing powers, but never even use them. The whole film is just about one event that is supposed to happen, when it does, its crap and lasts about 10 seconds. There is also a lot of pointless killing, and characters die before you even get to know them. If you want to watch a manga, watch Akira, and if you've seen it, watch it again.<br /><br />Rating: 4/10
