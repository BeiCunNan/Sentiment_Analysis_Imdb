in actors play there are several anachronisms 1. on these epoch women impossible to be such a leader! Sawing, kids or something - yes but spy - no way! 2. Fandorin acts like Rambo (shooting Turks in beginning) - no such tactics is possible in these days - they fight very different 3. soldiers - in these days Russian army was full of hard mans - not geeks and so on. Stupid but soldiers. In the movie they are gay, geeks, and non stop talking 4. Bulgarians playing dice - not at all.They drink "rakia", but not such plays dice - i think. 5. Women in these days is imaginary to say her own thought - but in the movie girl acts like emancipating ones. <br /><br />I don't like this movie - good idea but it is ridiculous...
