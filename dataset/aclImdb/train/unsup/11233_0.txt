I'm so in love with this movie. I'm very glad i rented it. my husband even liked it,which was a welcome surprize.I love'd the imagery and powerful story. It pulled me along with it the entire time. I liked the love story between Asoka and his "warrior". I love that her character was so strong.The war scenes are very powerful but not so much in the overly gory way seen in most movies. This movie broke my heart several times during the watching of it-but in a very good way. I've been inspired to check out this genre more often.Asoka's a legend\ folktale brought to life the very way i'd want it to be if i were reading it.I plan to add this movie to my collection and reccomend it to others.
