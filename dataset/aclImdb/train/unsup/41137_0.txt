For anyone who has suffered through this movie , you have my sympathies. Cindy Williamns in a porno musical ? Ouch:Look for the quick cameo of Ron Howard as an acting hopeful.Sheesh what was he thinking of doing this filth. It tried to make fun of the porno industry by camping it .Dancing Dlldos, songs about perversion , a man and woman dancing naked and singing an explicit song about intercourse and homosexuality.<br /><br />Various other stupid scenes , a woman auditioning who just drops her dress ,shes nude under it and starts simulating an orgasm assuming thats all she needs to do to get the part.When they ask her to sing the musical scales, she starts singing the word scales over and over , i mean i wanted to scream. Only thing that kept me watching was my dumb friend who paid for the pizza and rental. I left the room only to walk back and see him actually enjoying the garbage. Other scenes , they call for a stuntman to take over when another actor cant perform. This movie isnt funny its just total filth. Cindi Williams did this during her Laverne and Shirley days for some dumb reason. Another reason why she probably wont get many decent roles anymore.She was typecast and took some bad movie roles. She should have gone to directing like Penny Marshall or Ron Howard .I think this movie was done by idiots.
