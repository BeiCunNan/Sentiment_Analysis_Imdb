The idea of the movie was good; the message (that we all waste our life at meaningless jobs rather than doing something we'd really like) made a lot of sense to me. However, the movie ruined it on so many levels. First of all, Adam Sandler can't act at all. And the part when he becomes fat is not believable at all.<br /><br />Second, most of the jokes in the movie are obvious and are not that funny. Why did they have to include that stupid fart joke? The jokes about Sandler's sex life did not add anything to the plot either.<br /><br />I give it 3, and not 1, just for the jokes with the neighborhood boy, which were really funny. Too bad all but one of them were in the very beginning of the movie.
