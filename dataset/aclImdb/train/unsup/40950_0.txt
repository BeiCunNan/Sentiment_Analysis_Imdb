I am currently watching this film as we speak. It has a very trivial plot line. The whole film involves 4 terrorists, who look like fashion models sitting in the cockpit of the plane with Ninja Turtle like scarfs on their foreheads. The whole film is nothing but the victims calling their families over and over. Nothing more. It is very poorly constructed and directed. I am going to view the film version and then formulate an opinion. I just didn't enjoy this film very much. The filming quality even is mediocre because it looks like it was shot in the 1980s. It confused my husband and myself into believing that this was the actual film version. It is not. I did not like how they made it seem like they were using cell phones in mid-air. Everyone knows that this is not at all possible.
