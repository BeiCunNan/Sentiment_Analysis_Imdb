This is one of my favorite films of all time with a brilliant cast. Cher puts on the performance of a lifetime as the mother of a child frowned upon by society because he looks different. Eric Stoltz also gives a hell of a performance as Rocky Dennis, the teenager who's head is a weird shape because of a growth problem. When Rocky finally gets accepted into a school and does really well, his Mom and friends give him a massive cheer and applause! Touching stuff. Sam Elliot gives great support as Rocky's mom's fella. Rocky later meets Diana, a beautiful blind girl and romance blossoms. When Rocky teaches Diana how to 'see' through touch she is delighted at her new way to see and this has to be one of the most beautiful scenes ever committed to camera in a movie. This is by far one of the best films of all time.
