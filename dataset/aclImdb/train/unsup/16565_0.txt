Let's see.. in a large bowl, mix together effortless acting, extremely overlit sets, a made-for-tv, afterschool special script, cliches about how all men are either pigs or ineffectual and all women know what they want, obligatory, gap-filling scenes involving an easy listening pop tune where all the major characters get to dance together and, finally, the inevitable soft ending where the world gets back<br /><br />together, somewhat changed but somehow still the same, and you'll have this<br /><br />"home ec" project of a film. I'm not sure which was worse; the film's existence, the money I paid to see it or the fact that Julia Roberts was actually paid $12 milllion to act out of this bag. That money should have gone to the "continuity department" to do its job and actually pay attention tot how many hairstyles Julia Roberts goes through in each and every scene.
