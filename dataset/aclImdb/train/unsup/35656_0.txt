This is a Rodney Dangerfield vehicle, and I suppose it must be considered in that light. It is full of his snappy zings, a few of which are quite funny. But not nearly enough of them. The plot is ridiculous, which I suppose is okay. Some of the supporting cast is terrible, which is not. It has Robert Downey, Jr. (who wasn't bad as the campus leftist, who really doesn't understand leftism) who was on the upside of his career, and Ned Beatty and Sally Kellerman and Adrienne Barbeau who were on the downside of theirs, and Sam Kinison who was on the only side of his. (Kellerman actually turned in as good a performance as the material allowed.) But this movie is for Dangerfield fans only. If you're not, don't bother.
