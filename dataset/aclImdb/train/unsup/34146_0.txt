In 1600 the world population, for the first time in the history of mankind, reached 1 billion people. This doubled in 1860 to 2 billion people. Then in 1960 this doubled to 3 billion and then it accelerated to 4 billion in 1976. Right now we are heading towards 7 billion people and they all have to be fed, need schooling, want things we all want. I do like warning documentaries but they should tell the real problem and that is overpopulation. Of course politics won't burn their hands on this problem because of the powers of religions but the real problem are Too Many People, that is why the wild animals are leaving, dying out, there is not enough space. <br /><br />In this documentary, the same as Al Gore's, has many faults as global warming has nothing to do with mankind. Throughout the 4.5 billion years of history of the earth, climate has changed all the time. Greenland used to be green, pools have changed and Ice-times followed by warming up is part of the earth history. And we cannot stop this, we are living on a very violent planet, nothing is stable, earth quakes, volcanic eruptions, changing of magnetic fields, drifting of continental shells. Pollution is something we can stop, overpopulation we can stop. Climate change not. Of course with Global Warming scam, taxes can be raised without protest, trying to stop population grows is dangerous for politicians.
