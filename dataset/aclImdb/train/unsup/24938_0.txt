I enjoyed Out on a Limb - it made me laugh out loud. I felt that the storyline cleverly linked into todays obsession with 'celebrity' and the lengths to which people will go in order to remain in the public eye. (I can no longer watch TV chefs without wondering) It is refreshing to see a film using 'low tech' filming techniques, which in this case created a normal yet off kilter ambiance which suited the English style black humour of the production perfectly. I liked the speeded up time sequences. The direction brought out strong performances from the main actors who delivered. I liked the final sequence which left my friends and I laughing at the end of the DVD. It's always good to end on a laugh. Good film.
