To faint-hearted US citizens - who tend to pass out or cry havoc at the mere sight of a female nipple - this decidedly tepid tale of a 17-year-old lesbian girl falling in love with her 40-ish teacher and dragging her into bed might have SCANDAL written all over it; to more enlightened people, it's simply shallow and, even at its b-movie running time of 76 minutes, immensely boring. The muddled, underwritten script works strictly on the level of a high-school play, driving home its well-worn messages (true love will find a way to overcome even the greatest obstacles, heterosexual men are selfish bastards and bad in bed to boot) with all the subtlety of a poorly greased jackhammer. And while the acting is okay, some scenes - such as the kissing-in-the-swimming-pool bit - look as cheesy as if they were lifted straight from "The L Word" or a soft-core lesbian sex flick; how director Katherine Brooks managed to hire people like Elizabeth Shue, Will Patton and the ever-magnificent Frances Conroy for her latest effort ("Waking Madison") is beyond me. Finally, the climactic (no pun intended) sex scene is actually very tame and never goes beyond European prime-time TV standards, so, dear kids and guardians of public morals, there's really nothing to worry about.<br /><br />Contrary to some of the comments here, the film doesn't encourage, let alone propagate "pedophilia" (which generally stands for the sexual abuse of a child, a category a sexually active and aggressive 17-year-old hardly qualifies for in my book) but mostly plays like a chin-up movie for young lesbians about to come out.
