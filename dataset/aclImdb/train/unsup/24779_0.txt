What can I tell about Julie Delpy? After watching Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), both this year in the same day, I took some time looking for other movies she's in, and this woman rocks.<br /><br />This movie is wonderful in all senses. If you're expecting something like Before Sunset or Sunrise, you're right. If you think that it will be the same thing, you're wrong. If you think that you will spend 96 minutes just hearing dialogs, you're right. If you think you'll get bored, you're wrong. If you think this is a love story, you're right. If you think that it's a ordinary one, you're wrong.<br /><br />Even being a romantic comedy, it surprises you all the time becoming a terrific romantic comedy. I recommend for those ones that love this kind of genre but is tired to always watch the same things. The ironic dialogs are great from the beginning to the end, there are moments truly hilarious and intelligent without being clich√©.<br /><br />Julie Delpy directed, wrote, edited, produced, composed the original score and also is the main actress. This woman is brilliant, I'm fascinated by her and each new work she's in.
