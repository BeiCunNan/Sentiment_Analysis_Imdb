Hadley, MA. The Mountain Farm Cinemas. 1991. Me sitting with a pile of friends, eagerly clasping their hands and gazing at the blank screen, eyes shining, all the while babbling to me that I (not having seen the first movie) was in for a total treat.<br /><br />Ten minutes into the movie, they were wringing their hands and en masse apologizing to me, and I was laughing my head off. No, this isn't the worst movie of all time - it's "funny"-bad, not bad-bad, like Moment By Moment. But my, what a steaming incoherent pile of dreck. Did NO one during its filming step back and ask "What in the hell are we doing?" Did no one graduate from film school and remember that the purpose of a scene is to advance the plot? (e.g., that ten-times overlong train scene ... we'd already figured out that Ironside's character was a nutcase, thank you ever so)<br /><br />I don't give 1s except to the very worst films of all, but this movie deserves it, if only because the producers and directors ought to have known better.
