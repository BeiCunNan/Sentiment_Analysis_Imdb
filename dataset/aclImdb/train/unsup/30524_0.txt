This was apparently from Hitchcocks low period between Notorious 1946 and Strangers on a Train in 1951, that Rope has offcourse later become a classic, while Paradine Case and Under Capricorn haven't. While it's certainly not one of Hithcocks best, it have a few scenes that is just wonderful, and characters. The Laziest Gal in Town, Marlene Dietrich does what she does best, singing a torch song, but she's very good as the spoilt superstar. (She made another movie in Britain with James Stewart and Glynis Johns in 1951) Jane Wyman reminded me of Margaret Lockwood in The Lady Vanishes, as the lady in distress who for no reason actually want's to solve a crime. OK she was somehow involved by heart to Richard Todd. Richard Todd was the man on the run, seen him in a few Disney movies of the 50s so I guess he was the star for a while (He was in a movie with Bette Davis where she played Queen Elizabeth) Michael Wilding played the Police representative, meeting Jane coincidentaly in a bar, or not.... But 3 other names makes this delicious too! Alastair Sim, Dame Sibyl Thorndike and Joyce Grenfell.
