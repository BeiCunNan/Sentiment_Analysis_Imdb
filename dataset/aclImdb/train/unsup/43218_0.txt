This is the worst movie in recorded history! It takes the cake as the stupidest movie ever. If you really want to see it, rent the mystery science theatre version and watch them make fun of it. Otherwise it's not worth your time. The music is just as bad with wierd blips here and there and sparratic, spaz drumming.
