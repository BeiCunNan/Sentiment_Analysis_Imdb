Don Julio Madariaga, affectionately called the centaur, spoke this word of wisdom.<br /><br />The movie which presumably boosted Valentino's career or something definitely belongs to the silent trash. It seems uninspired and insipid in the extreme; it might have his fans but there are plenty of sick people nowadays. But it did some service, it brought me back on earth by reminding me that the silent masterpieces I used to digest are not the whole silent cinema. The silent garbage, as this Valentino flick proves, was as vile and unappealing as the later one.<br /><br />FOUR HORSEMEN has one of the ugliest casts ever. Most of the performers are ridiculously ugly.<br /><br />Rudy Valentino was perhaps a moderately goodlooking boy; the rest of the performers in the FOUR HORSEMEN's cast are extremely unappealing. The movie is clumsily made; I have forgotten how bad a silent movie can bethe Valentino vehicle reminded me. It might of meant something in Rudy's career; but it's ugly and mishandled. The caricaturing of the Germans is absolutely sickening.<br /><br />I have seen mostly masterpieces of the silent; this one belongs to the garbage league; a piece of anti-militarist and antiGerman propaganda, insipid and uninspired.
