Amiable Neil Simon farce about good-hearted defense attorney Glenda Parks (Goldie Hawn), who's a sucker for hard luck cases and even incorrigible types. She's married to district attorney Ira Parks (Charles Grodin), who's about to campaign for attorney general. Into their lives comes her ex-husband Nick Gardenia (Chevy Chase), who just won't leave her alone. As the story begins, Nick is forced by two criminals to participate in a bank robbery and when they let him go (albeit while their vehicle is in motion), Nick figures Glenda - who he's never stopped loving - will be the only one willing to help him.<br /><br />Hawn, Grodin, and Chase are all cast in parts perfect for each. (As a matter of fact, the entire film is cast well right down the line.) Chase gets to toss off his trademark wiseacre quips and even indulge in a little physical comedy. Hawn is just as sweet as could be and Grodin is in fine grumpy form. And they're supported well by the other actors, including Robert Guillaume as Grodins' colleague, George Grizzard as the governor, and Harold Gould as the judge who has to watch as his courtroom turns into a circus. Particularly fun are Yvonne Wilder as harried maid Aurora and T.K. Carter as kleptomaniac turned chauffeur Chester.<br /><br />The film itself marks a capable theatrical debut for Jay Sandrich, a man who honed his craft working on many TV series over the years. At one point, Gould remarks during the climactic trial how he loves it when time flies by. Well, time flies by watching this film as well. It's quite entertaining with not one dull moment. Simons' script is quite funny and spirited, with a dinner party rating as a real comedic highlight. It's all good-natured fun from its beginning to its end.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of the writer and the stars.<br /><br />8/10
