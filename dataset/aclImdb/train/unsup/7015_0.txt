When it comes to bad "B" movies, Doug is the King! Some movies are just plain bad (i.e. "The Grifters") while others are exquisitely bad ("Warlords of Atlantis"). I will say this, "The Land That Time Forgot" is much "badder"! Don't get me wrong on this--I love all Doug McClure movies for the simple reason that they are so wonderfully bad. And I cried when I heard he had passed away--long live Doug on the screen!
