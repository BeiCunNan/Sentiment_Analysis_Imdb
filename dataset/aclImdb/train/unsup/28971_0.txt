This is one of the most powerful war-time dramas I have ever experienced. I expected a certain amount of sentiment throughout the movie but I certainly did not think the realities of war from the point of view of two orphans would be this harshly portrayed. The film was quite hard to digest for the simple fact that the older brother, Seita, can be easily sympathized with but at the same time, we realize that the situation he is in is his own doing. His pride came in the way and watching him struggle with his sister is just too heart-breaking. I really didn't expect an anime to produce *the* most depressing ending ever and I was totally not prepared to witness it but i am still glad I saw the movie. It was simply terrific.
