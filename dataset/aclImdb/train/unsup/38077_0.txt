I love Urban Legends quite simply because it is from the Scream era when all teen slash horrors were worth watching, even the rubbish ones. And then they followed it up with a sequel, Urban Legends 2 : Final Cut which was absolutely awful but rather amusing at the same time, mainly due to the superb Loretta Devine who is always worth watching. So now they have number 3, and here is what they have done.<br /><br />1) Urban Legends 1 and 2 have Loretta Devine in it as the token black girl who thinks she is Foxy Cleopatra - this on has a token black girl who looks like Foxy Cleopatra but who is the worst actress ever in the world.<br /><br />2) Urban Legends 1 (and some of 2) follows proper Urban Legends from folklore and makes them come true, this one just uses the lame ones that some kid who goes to the special school made up in his lunch break<br /><br />3) Urban Legends 1 has a very pretty cast, number 2's cast were kinda pretty, this one, well, lets just say that the whole cast were maimed by the ugly forest!!!! <br /><br />4) Urban Legends 1 and 2 had a cool killer mask guy, this one has some dude in a ski jacket with his hood up and he only appears in the last 10 minutes <br /><br />5) Urban Legend 1 had a killer twist, Urban Legend 2 had a decent finale, this one was just a load of crap, some stuff happens and nobody even cares (i.e. SPOILER ALERT!!! main girl who finds out her brother has been killed, does she care??? Does she heck) <br /><br />So this movie is rubbish, and the people who gave it 10 out of 10 on here have obviously never watched a decent movie in their lives and probably own the entire Mary Kate and Ashley DVD collection and list Mac and Me as their favourite movie of all time!!!! AVOID THIS MOVIE!!!!
