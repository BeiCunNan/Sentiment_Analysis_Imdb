which is what I wish I had done. Some decent actors are largely wasted in this pale sci-fi tale. Score is straight out of Quake, and in fact the whole thing has that kind of video game feeling, though at least in a video game you are participating in some small way. It's not even fun on a camp level. Pass it by.
