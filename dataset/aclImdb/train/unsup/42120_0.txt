I have not read the novel this film was based on, but I did recently watch the 1980 version. While the modern version has better production values, sets, costumes, etc. I have to say that I favor the 1980 version. Both films are less than forthcoming with what is going on, but at least the 1980 version attempted to tell a complete story. (Spoilers follow.) Where were the aliens? Where was the mention that there was nuclear war in April 1998? Where was the confrontation between Haber and Orr? Having read a bit about the novel and having watched the interview with LeGuin, I know that the 1980 version was more faithful to the source material, and for that (as well as better performances from the two male leads) I have to recommend that version over A&E's Reader's Digest version.
