This movie is about an evil hypnotist who has a worse act than that of the Great Vorelli from "The Devil Doll". The hypnotist known as Dr Carlo Lombardi puts a woman under hypnosis asks her questions and she answers...great show, eh? Amazingly he makes a living doing this. He can also use the woman to call forth a creature from the ocean to kill. He doesn't really have a reason for doing this other than a hobby. Meanwhile another hypnotist who is also a researcher is staying at a house where an older couple and their daughter live. The couple is rich and the daughter really likes this guy, but he apparently hates these people, which begs the question "why is he staying with them in the first place?" There are also some cops looking into the deaths of people killed by the creature and the rich old guy makes a deal with Lombardi to bring his act of asking questions on the road. The hero of the story Lance Fuller who is the guy who really shouldn't be staying with the rich people falls in love with the woman who is hypnotized. There is a dog and also an unfunny butler and maid...all in all a rather talky movie with a lame monster that appears here and there.
