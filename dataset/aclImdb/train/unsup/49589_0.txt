I glanced at other reviews, and I have to wonder...did I miss something? This seems like an interesting enough premise but the execution left something to be desired, in my mind. A female police officer (Sarah-Jane Redmond) is drawn into a situation by a drug dealer who has come to the station with stories of being kidnapped (with a few other men) and submitted to some "game playing" for their lives, but he managed to escape, although others were not that lucky. There's also something at the beginning of the film about a monk who documented the story of a nun possessed by what seems to be a fallen angel, back in the 1600's...more about that it a minute. After Porhowski (Redmond) is asked to get her interviewee some water, she returns to find him gone, and by then he's been ID'd as an ex-con who did time for drug trafficking, so they of course, want to find him. And Porhowski does find him, in her car, and he's taking her back to the parking garage where his ordeal took place because she must die in his place (the price for his being set free). Now, that all sounds fairly decent, but here's a few things that didn't work for me. The games that these men are being forced to play to win their survival: I was thinking, like, oh, Russian Roulette, stuff like that, NOT musical chairs & bingo. Oh, and 5-card stud. And a fallen angel taking up residence in a parking garage to dole out justice...uh, right. And this is supposedly the very same fallen angel that appeared at a convent back in the 1600's, and whose history you see a monk busily scribbling in black & white flashbacks (since apparently they didn't have color film in the 1600's?) The overall atmosphere of the film isn't bad, but there seems to be a lot of gaping holes & the overall story is rather confusing and vague. Had some decent potential but did not live up to it. 3 out of 10.
