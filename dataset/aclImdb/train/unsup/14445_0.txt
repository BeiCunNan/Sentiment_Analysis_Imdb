zRate: 1/10<br /><br />This movie is flaw-ness, the director and the writer should just hang themselves for good.<br /><br />THE BS scene:- The woman's old house was burned when she's a kid, may be not burned down but definitely burned bad. When she and the d-Cop revisit the house, everything is in good shape, just dusty. It's like nothing has happened. Definitely stinks :(<br /><br />Why would the d-cop give his gun to the woman and go investigate alone without a gun?? Just because he could have two good chances to let the killer gets away. And so the movie can drag on for another hour.<br /><br />another BS scene:- Outside the Media Art place, where the d-cop should be ran over by the killer and died long ago!? I've watch this part frame by frame. It's impossible for the killer to make a "3-point turn" and face the d-cop at the end. To cover up, the director decided to use scene with car crashing into barrels of water instead.<br /><br />For those who think this movie is good or even fantastic, all I can say is u haven't watch enough good movies to make a better judgment... SAD...
