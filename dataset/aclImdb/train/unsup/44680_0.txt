Man, i remember this movie. when I was little I use 2 always watch this. I use 2 be scared of it 2, but now that its 2005, the movie is so cheesy now. Demonic Toys, Wax Works and all of the Puppet Masters are so lame now. Even though years before I was terrified!!!! It's really weird 2 look back on all the things that scared u when u were younger, and look at them now. All I can do is laugh at this corny crap! It's just so weird. It was around the time that killer dolls were frighting. But Chucky is still watchable. He's still somewhat creepy I guess, but now it's nothing but good old humor!! I do however suggest that u rent this film or even buy it if u want 2 watch a comedy. It should be fun 2 sit around with friends and laugh at this movie. Besides that the plot was awful and the effects were useless, u could find something good about it if u look hard enough. But me? Absolutely not, I still can't believe this use 2 give me goose bumps!
