"The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer" offered Cary Grant a plum comedy role, which he obviously relished with glee. It got him cast as a smart artist playboy paired with no nonsense judge Myrna Loy, whose younger sister, Shirley Temple, has some growing up pains to work through. This trio, assisted by Ray Collins, Harry Davenport, and Rudy Vallee in a very funny turn, work together for some good laughs, thanks to a clever original script by Sidney Sheldon. A sequence at a park picnic is hilarious. A nice little comedy, representative of the post-WWII period as folks were looking for light entertainment and approaching the 50s with bright anticipation.
