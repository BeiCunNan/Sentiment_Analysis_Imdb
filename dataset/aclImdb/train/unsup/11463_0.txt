BRILLIANT! ENTERTAINING! THOUGHT-PROVOKING! STUNNING! What else can be said about this video collection? Madonna offers her fans 14 of "her" favorite video clips from 1993-1999. There are some real gems in this compilation: "Bad Girl", "Fever", "Rain", "Secret", "Take A Bow", "Bedtime Story", "Human Nature", "Love Don't Live Here Anymore", "Frozen", "Ray Of Light", "Drowned World/Substitute For Love", "The Power Of Goodbye", "Nothing Really Matters", and "Beautiful Stranger". The addition of "Drowned World/Substitute For Love", being only a European realease in the past, is reason enough to make this title a must for Madonnas U.S. fans. The only upset to this compilation are the missing videos: "This Used To Be My Playground", "Erotica", "Deeper and Deeper", "You Must Love Me" and "I'll Remember".<br /><br />Madonna has made REMARKABLE contributions to the video arena, more than any other artist to date! Madonna's videos are a strong part of American Pop Culture. Madonna's videos are no stranger to awards either, "Take A Bow" received the AMA and the MTV VMA "Video Of The Year" Award, while "Ray Of Light" won MTV VMA "Video Of The Year" Award, also helped usher in one of Madonna's first four Grammy's!<br /><br />
