i don't know about you guy's but this movie was awesome.also the message that the movie is trying to pass is the reality of our life's.the end of the movie where bless is being killed by the cop and after that it says "you have to make the right decision" it's the best ending and at the same time the most touch full ending that i've ever seen. you shouldn't stand in such worthless part of the movie such as the graffiti terminology. focus on the message that every movie is trying to pass to you. don't see the tree and loose the forest.... if of course you know what i mean..........thats all guy's,i hope that this comment will make you rethink again the whole think and change your point of view for this movie.......thanks,see ya.
