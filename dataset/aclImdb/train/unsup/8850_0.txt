I actually am in the minority & really like this show. I thought there was a certain level of realness here, that is definitely missing in Cashmere Mafia. Yes, there are areas that need to be flushed out and fixed. But that takes time. Hey, the 1st season of Sex and the City just DID NOT work, but went on to be a great show. I believe the same can happen here. Lindsay Price needs time to settle into her role and the whole cast could use a moment to mesh. By no means am I saying these are the same show, but I feel this one needs a moment to gel and form into its own. Please stop beating the show up and give it a chance. You may actually be surprised. 8 stars!
