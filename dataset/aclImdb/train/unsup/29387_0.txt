I was hesitant to watch this film. A friend had rented it and ask me to watch it. <br /><br />The acting here is good by most everyone. It is also interesting how you get to see 'behind the scenes' of a person who is a mega-star. You get a little peek into the private life that you might not see otherwise.<br /><br />At times the film feels lurid and soapy. But other times it is fascinating. Kevin Costner did a very good job here and looks so handsome. He really gave his character life here. Whitney Houston also does a good job and it wasn't any stretch at all to believe her portrayal of the big star singer. <br /><br />Probably a film that women would enjoy more than men but despite the flaws, I did enjoy it. I don't think it ever became too sappy. I think the reason for the attacks on the star are probably the weakest point of the film.
