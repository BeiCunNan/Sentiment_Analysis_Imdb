OK. I give this a great rating partly because it really hits a lot of areas that I, personally, enjoy. The emotional focus is on the father-son relationship, and the idea of being able to contact your deceased parent. That alone would make me at least interested in<br /><br />the movie. It also deals with "the space/time continuum" idea not all too far removed from "Back to the Future", but certainly not in<br /><br />a comedy sense. These types of movies are a guilty pleasure. It<br /><br />also manages to weave in a semi-interesting murder mystery. The fact that there is the backdrop of the 1969 World Series is just an added treat for a baseball junkie, such as myself. It's sort of a "Field of Dreams" meets "Back to the Future" with a side of murder mystery. All in all, I really enjoyed it. I have watched it again, now that it's<br /><br />on video, and it holds up to multiple viewings. It will probably be one of those movies that I watch periodically to make me feel better.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm not going to give any plot lines or rave about the performances (they were all fine). The true value of the movie came from the story and the direction. Just watch the movie, I doubt you'll be disappointed.
