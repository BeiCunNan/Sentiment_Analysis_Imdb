I was amused to read of bafflement at the long run of Gloomy Sunday in NZ, especially Christchurch. To begin with, it is based (very loosely) around a truish story... the song itself did cause a stir when reports of its association with suicides were circulated. It is atmospheric, the cafe evocative of life in the 1930s, a haunting melody, and a nice twist at the end. Yes... it continues to play in Christchurch and so ensures its own success....<br /><br />I went just after seeing LOTR:FOTR, and found Gloomy Sunday to be a more introvertive and rewarding film..... it was just one of those days... just like going into see Fitzcarraldo with no expectations....
