despite the opening credits. Finally got to see this on IFC, and the only thing they got right here was that Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez were killers. To wit:<br /><br />1) The story took place in the late 40's, not the late 60's.<br /><br />2) The scene of Martha confronting the nurse and orderly is pure fiction. She was superintendent of a home for handicapped children in Florida, not a head nurse at a hospital in Alabama.<br /><br />3) After she was fired, Martha showed up at Raymond's apartment in New York with her two children, and dutifully abandoned them at a Salvation Army on his orders. None of this is in the film.<br /><br />4) Although they may have killed as many as 20 people, Martha and Raymond were convicted of one murder, the Albany widow. After they killed the Michigan widow and her child, they were extradited to New York, which had the death penalty. None of this is detailed.<br /><br />5) Martha, crazed with jealousy over Raymond's wooing of their latest mark, calls the police? Needless to say, that didn't happen.<br /><br />This was an obvious answer to the ultra-glitzy Bonnie and Clyde. Granted, Honeymoon was shot on a shoe-string budget, but Kastle isn't half the filmmaker Arthur Penn is: the story jumps, the pacing is sluggish, the sound is wretched, and, he is so disinterested in his heroes or their victims, whom he insultingly depicts as hopelessly square and stupid, you wonder why he bothered! The result is a campiness only John Waters could love (Shirley Stoler could have been Divine's mother!) Gustav Mahler must be spinning in his grave!
