Laurence Olivier directed this adaptation of Terence Rattigan's play "The Sleeping Prince" about an American showgirl performing abroad in 1912, wooed by a stuffy prince. Marilyn Monroe-watchers will be disappointed by MM's lack of sparkle here; she certainly looks lovely but seemingly has no connection to this part, and no chemistry whatsoever with mannered Olivier as the starched, though not entirely humorless, royal. The sluggish pacing and overlength are deterrents, although the beginning of the movie is quite bright and the thoughtful, serious finish almost gives the dreary film some actual meaning. ** from ****
