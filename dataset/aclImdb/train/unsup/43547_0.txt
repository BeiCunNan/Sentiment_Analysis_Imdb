I watched this movie on DVD and I almost suffer a cardiac arrest - terrible piece of art!!!. I had watched The Swamp a couple of years ago, which I found even worse, unbearable really!!!. <br /><br />Lucrecia I'm sorry, but I don't really understand you at all. On top of that, I had the patience to go through all the "making of the movie" and the interviews that the DVD brings, I could not believe all the rubbish I was hearing. Not only you, but everyone who spoke in those interviews looked like complete charlatans. Trying to justify every single bit of the story with silly arguments.<br /><br />Absolutely pointless to keep wasting my time - please do not watch this crap!<br /><br />Cheers, Esteban Bernasconi<br /><br />PS: tried to write in Spanish but the system does not accept it!
