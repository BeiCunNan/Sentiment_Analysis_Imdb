****SPOILERS**** With the music of a dinky 50's rock & Roll 45 record "Sea of Love" playing on the turntable the police find the body of James Mackey, Brian Paul, laying face down and naked, on his bed with a bullet in the back of his head. Checking out the clues in Mackey's Manhattan apartment Det. Frank Keller, Al Pacino, finds a number of cigarette butts in the ashtray with lipstick on them deducing that the murderer may well have been the woman that Mackey was with that night. A few days later Det. Keller is contacted by a Det.Sherman, John Goodman, From the 112th police precinct in Richmond Hills Queens of a murder in that area that is very similar to the one he's investigating; A man shot dead with a bullet in the back of his head as he lay naked in bed, even the same song "Sea of Love" was still playing on his record player. <br /><br />It becomes obvious to the police that there's a serial murderer on the lose in New York City and he or she is targeting male swingers. Det. Keller finds a clue when he notices that both of the murder victims had placed ads in a local paper's personal section looking for romance and action with the opposite sex. Keller also notices that of the almost 100 personal ads only three were with rhymes or poems on them and two of those men who put poems on their ads were the two men who were found murdered. <br /><br />Det. Keller & Sherman check out the third person Raymond Brown, Michael O'Neill, who placed a poem in the paper looking for both love and companionship and their told by Raymond that he never followed up on the responses that he got from the women who got in touch with him. Which was a bit strange to both Det. Keller & Sherman since he spent $300.00 placing the ad, a beautiful poem that he took a lot of time and effort to write, in the paper and even had a secret apartment in the city that he was paying $500.00 a month for? Raymond who was happily married with children told the two detectives that he "Swears on his Children Eyes" that he never had an affair with any of the women who contacted him over the ad that he put in the paper. <br /><br />Later Raymond is found dead, naked with a bullet in the back of his head, in his secret Manhattan apartment, just like the other two murder victims. So much for Raymond's honesty. Well paced and stylish murder mystery drama with Al Pacino giving one of his best performances as Det. Keller, a deeply depressed and fatalistic man, who's only reason for living is his job as a policeman. <br /><br />Losing his wife to his partner Det. Gruber, Richard Jenkins, whom she married, and feeling alone and spiritless over it he feels that if he retires from the police department the emptiness that would envelope him will also drive him over the edge. You constantly see Pacino trying to keep himself together despite the pressure brewing inside of him that threatens to tear him apart. <br /><br />Very good supporting cast with Ellen Barkin, Helen, and John Goodman, Det. Sherman, among others with the movies very fine unsuspected and surprise ending which was very effective because the clues were always there for us to see but were so well hidden that we didn't notice them until the very end. <br /><br />Good inter-acting with Al Pacino and John Goodman as his new partner from Queens in cracking the case and especially with Ellen Barkin who was the link to the persons murdered in the movie without knowing it as well as her filling the void in Det. Keller's life that was driving him to a mental and emotional breakdown after his wife left him.
