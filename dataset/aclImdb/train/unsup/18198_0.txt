I thought this was a great movie. It reminded me of the Kevin Spacey's movie "The Usual Suspects". Yet I haven't seen a web site that recommends it if you watched this movie. I have recently watched "The Prestige". And I felt this movie had a Prestige ending. I was still putting the pieces together hours after the movie had ended. I was nearly going to skip this movie, because it was a 2005 film. And thought it must be crap. Otherwise I would have heard of it before. I only became aware, as it was coming up as a new release in the UK. So I surfed the web looking for a trailer. The first 45 minutes of the movie lays the foundation. With only one twist about the 20-min mark. But after that the movie picks up and the twists keep on coming. Then there's a fast ending that leaves you wondering what just happened. Even though I have said that this movie is like "The Usual Suspects" it is different and takes it to a higher level.
