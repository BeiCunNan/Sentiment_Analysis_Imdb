"Filme da Treta" is inspired in a previous work called "Conversa da Treta", which can be translated as "Blather" or "Foolish Talk". In fact it all begun with a radio show (with that name) where two friends, "Toni" and "Zezé", talk about their lives and their neighbourhood (located somewhere in a typical district of Lisbon!). Because of the colloquial and comic language it used to be funny. Then it passed to the stage (kind of a dialog play) and later to a TV-show. As you can see it was a success here in Portugal and the audiences applauded it<br /><br />Now, the film! "Filme da Treta" is, then, just an adaptation to the movies of this succeeded show, but it was, at least in my point of view, a regression! To be honest it was a disappointment, as I expected a lot more from it. I used to appreciate "Conversa da Treta", but now with the movie it lost all the fun! <br /><br />The film pretends to be funny using all the clichés and the same kind of language used in the previous shows, but it has no plot at all, and the new characters that were supposed to add something to Toni and Zeze's adventures almost don't appear! It's almost all the movie the characters "Toni" and "Zezé" having the same blather, but this time without fun (excepting a few jokes)! This film doesn't add anything to the previous works; worse, in a certain way it can even spoil some of the work done, because it should have had some evolution in order to keep it interesting and funny! <br /><br />This film is poor, very poor; I really expected more from it!
