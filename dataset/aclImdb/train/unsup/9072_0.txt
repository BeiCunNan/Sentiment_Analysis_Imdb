This film has a couple of shortcomings with plot, particularly the neat ending, and there seemed to be some difficulty with the continuity of locations (the family house, for instance). However, it is definitely worth watching for the performances. Tracy McMahon plays a small role at the beginning of the movie with utter conviction, flawlessly transforming from confident undergrad to crushed patient in a classroom demonstration. Andy Garcia is convincing as the haunted psychologist and superb as the grieving father, so much so that it makes for hard viewing. There's no greater pain than the loss of one's child, and Garcia conveys this with heartrending conviction. Not a film to watch alone if you have ever lost a child.
