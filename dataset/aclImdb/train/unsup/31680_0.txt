I just knew that I would enjoy this movie! Nanny McPhee is immensely entertaining, hands down! Emma Thompson is truly great as the film's title character. The other cast members are also very overwhelming! This picture made me very happy! Nanny McPhee is brought to the attention of a man with seven children because McPhee is just the person he needs to end his seemingly awful dilemma. You see, Nanny McPhee is no ordinary nanny; she possesses magical powers that can practically do the impossible. As a result, the children learn to respect her and most everyone else as well.<br /><br />Out of all the scenes that are featured in this movie, I liked it most when the nanny used her powers to make a donkey dance on two feet. During this scene, I was laughing very-I mean-very hard! This is easily one of the best remembered moments in the whole entire film.<br /><br />The movie closes very pleasantly, too, with a wedding scene where utter chaos breaks out and everyone gets messy! After the mayhem is over though, a very happy ending is taking place.<br /><br />This is one DVD that I definitely intend on buying!
