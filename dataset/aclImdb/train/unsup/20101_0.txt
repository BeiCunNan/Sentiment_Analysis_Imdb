This is a terrible movie that uses every trite sentimental piece of flotsom and jetsom that the irresponsible producers (Bette was one) could throw in.<br /><br />Here is the stout hearted troop entertaining other stout hearted troops from which hubby emerges to be sung to by his sexy smart mouthed hoofer/singer/wife on stage. His last hurrah. Cut to widow in black weeds. Here, worst of all, is the god-awful wrung out slow motion machine gun death of a perfect top-of-his-West-Point-class son, trying to reach Mom who, incidentally, probably drew the enemy fire in the first place with her belted out songs and thudding around the stage. <br /><br />It must be said in the son's favor, however, that he managed to get his hair stylishly cut (just a whisper of mousse)and deliver a moving anti-war speech to his slack jawed mom before biting the dust (dust he wouldn't have bit if he had the sense to come in out of the flack). By the way, didn't anyone casting this turkey realize that the son's bone structure and genetic characteristics would not have completely altered over the years from childhood? I think the adult son actor is hunky, but he must have been a Walk In for the other kid.<br /><br />It is deeply offensive to portray any young man dying the way this movie does. It is vicious and unnecessary, given the countless thousands of non-chic snipped young men who died in Vietnam. And, let's just say it, it is an insult to West Point. I mean, really, if they can't even teach their "point man" to keep his damn head down under fire, we might as well turn the place into a day care center.<br /><br />However, all that said, I would definitely recommend you see this movie. Bette in a rubber ducky suit is worth the price. Why is it that special effects people can give us incredible illusions like Star Wars, and can't make one middle aged Jewish woman believable as a dottering old crone? Just as well, it's hilarious to watch her waddle. When I saw Old Bette in that purple Balenciaga ballgown, I reflexively looked for the tie down rope.<br /><br />I can't bear to share my thoughts about the tear jerking (from laughter) final scene in this flick. Let's just say that "For the Boys" should be a boxed set with the remake of "Lost Horizon".
