A Filipino cinematic gem that went largely unnoticed during its commercial run. Thankfully, it got the acclaim it truly deserves when it won both the grand prix and children's jury prize -- a feat never before achieved -- in the 2004 Berlin Film Festival.<br /><br />A Palanca-winning story, masterful directing and great acting from just about everyone in the cast, but most specially child actors Jiro Manio, Isabella de Leon and the boy who played Manio's best friend, combine for a viewing experience you will remember long after the credits roll. Poverty and death do not beg for sympathy and tears in this movie, but they are likely to fall just the same.<br /><br />Could be veteran (though nonetheless underrated) director Maryo J. delos Reyes' most heartwarming, uplifting film.
