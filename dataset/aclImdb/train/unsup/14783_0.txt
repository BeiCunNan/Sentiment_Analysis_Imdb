Oh my God! I love this movie, this is the best movie i have seen so far.. This movie is set in New York! This movie is a blend of romantic comedy and family melodrama. The first half of the film is absolutely hilarious and is packed with moments that will bring a smile to everybody's face. Meanwhile Johar(producer) and Advani(director) develop the storyline subtly by sneaking in drama which adds spice to the proceedings and paves the way for a dramatic and emotional climax.<br /><br />It is a wonderful film about living life and enjoying the days we have because we don't know what tomorrow will bring. Aman (Shahrukh khan) the main leading actor falls in love with Naina Catherine Kapoor (Preity Zinta) who belongs to a Punjabi family, she is not married and have no intentions to be. Shahrukh Khan later find out in the movie that he has a heart disease and would not be able to live for long. So he never tells Naina that he loves her instead of that he hooked Naina with her best friend Said Ali Khan whose a total flirt but later on fells in love with Naina too..<br /><br />I cried a lot when i watched this movie in the theater I was crying the whole time but enjoyed it a lot! I would encourage every one to see this movie because I learned a lot from this movie.. Life is beautiful guys so live it the fullest!!
