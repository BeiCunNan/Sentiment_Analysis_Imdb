I expected less, since the series in the late 60's was so lame; but this long, two-part series was pretty damn good. Fast-moving and tightly-paced production with strong performances. I watched only because Barbara Steele was in it; by the conclusion I was hungering for more. Yeah, they ought to release this on DVD.<br /><br />The leads were superb--very strong performance by actor in the Barnabas role. Ben Kingsley? I forget. And his love interest Joanna Going was hot, to say the least. She was later in that Brendan Fraser film STILL BREATHING, playing the babe Fraser's character pursued. By the way that's another film that, I think, is overlooked. A satisfyingly funny romantic comedy. <br /><br />Joanna Going just happened to sit next to me in the balcony of the Paramount Theater at STILL BREATHING's world premiere in Austin during SXSW a few years ago. I hope she still thinks of me.
