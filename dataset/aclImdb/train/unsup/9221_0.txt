I was lucky enough to catch the Anarchist Cookbook at the Deep Ellum Film festival. I think it was one of the best independent movies I've ever seen! The writing was superb, the acting amazing and the story was truly original. I was so happy to finally see an independent movie that wasn't prententious, but still smart enought to take the audience on a journey without talking down to it. Besides being really funny, it also has its sobering and touching moments. I really think this movie has the makings of a cult classic.
