I loved this show, personally. However, it never caught on. And now, I'll never know what happens next. The tv show rocked. I thought it was one of the better shows FOX decided to give a whirl. In fact, I'd say its much better then the garbage they try to unload now (A show called 24 comes to mind). The premise was pretty cool. If i remember correctly, Hobbes is put into a computer/alternate reality (to test out a new training simulation) and is stuck in. The real reason he was put in is to get rid of this guy, Santiago, who is controlling the sim. Note: The song Climbatize by Prodigy is played numerous times.
