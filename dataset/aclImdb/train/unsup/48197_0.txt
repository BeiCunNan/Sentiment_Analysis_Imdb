I went to see this movie in Amsterdam with a friend and her 2 children in Dutch. We were also the only people in the cinema. It took only 5 minutes to convince me: this is the worst movie I have ever seen. What father would tell his daughter to kiss the first bozo that comes along, just because he can drive a race car....<br /><br />I think something must have gone wrong in the translation because throughout the movie I had the feeling we were back in the fifties teaching the children that the women's place is in the kitchen or otherwise just look pretty and shut up. Fine role model aye.... OK I'm exaggerating; in English it can't have been that bad: otherwise Patrick Stewart would not have taken part in it! So much for the dialog.<br /><br />Although I must say that the creators have really tried to make a decent movie, I think the dialog is the downfall of this flick. I voted 1 out of 10. Better luck next time.
