This is a horror-movie with great atmosphere. The film is pretty bloody consider that it have been made in 1972. The effect are cheap, but they have been made with style, and the some of the actors are really great (but not all). The first part of "Tower of Evil" is a bit dull, but the rest of the movie is exciting.<br /><br />I liked it, but it's not for everybody's taste.
