No wonder GEORGE SANDERS got tired of being cast as Simon Templar, here in "The Saint in London". Although filmed in London, it has almost no flavor of a bustling city in its screenplay which has him on the trail of a bunch of counterfeiters and looks as if it was filmed on the quick on some strictly low-budget sets. He has David BURNS as his valet and SALLY GRAY as his blonde love interest. Whenever the scene shifts to a car chase outdoors, the process photography is obvious.<br /><br />It's all very ordinary with the usual number of close escapes as The Saint leaves his calling card wherever he goes.<br /><br />Sanders looks young and in good shape but seems almost bored with his role--and in this case, it's understandable. What little plot there is holds almost no surprises and it's all over in a matter of 72 minutes. It has the look and feel of a sub-standard B-film and nothing more than routine story without a spark of imagination.
