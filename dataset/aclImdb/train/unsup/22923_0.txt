This was a show that my siblings and I grew up with in Miami where we lived at the time. And it was during that time that the arcade video game thing, was a huge deal. Remember this as really the first and only game show about video arcade games. That would set a blueprint for "Nick Arcade" among video arcade games. But Starcade is an original and really the original is the original. Also it had my favorite host, Geoff Edwards from "Jackpot" and "Treasure Hunt!" Sadly due to the video game crash and head honcho of TBS Ted Turner, wanting to develop new shows. It only lasted for two years. Should have had a longer life but thanks to the official website, Starcade.TV. It has since become a cult classic. Long Live Starcade!
