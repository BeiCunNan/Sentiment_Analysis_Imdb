I saw this piece of tripe and couldn't believe the mockery of a brilliant yet ruthless legend. Teach deserves more respect, like the portrayal of him in the National Geographic film "Terror At Sea". He was inventive, strong minded, and wise up until his brutal death. To betray these traits is offensive to me when there aren't many others who could have held a candle to him and most likely never will. To make some goofy film about the most notorious seaman of all time, especially in the era of Sergio Leone & others is just an embarrassment. I don't mean to be a nerd or defend a man who some may find offensive, but as far as history is concerned (in my own opinion) he was among the most riveting. I feel he was more of a role model than a villain depending on the perspective you take. Any film that takes at shot at a man such as he is a display of ignorance and stupidity. I suggest reading "Under The Black Flag" by David Cordingly who writes about Teach using fact, not silliness which only minimizes and belittles the genius of one of the last true men who embraced freedom and had the will & courage to choose his own destiny "The floggings will continue until morale improves."
