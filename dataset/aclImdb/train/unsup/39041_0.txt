Another work of Zdravko Sotra who continued to make films for big screen as if they are TV films. Even worse than Zona Zamfirova which at least had a story, this one should get us closer to Serbian tradition, but failed to do what they advertise. Make as an adaptation of Stevan Sremac's novel, it shows that Sotra is awful script writer. There is no story at all. There are some entertaining gags during three days of feast (thanks to excellent actors) but that can not save the movie since there is no storyline! And, again, as with Zona Zamfirova, the camera positioning is like in TV film. Why then bother to go to cinema? My advice: don't waste time with this one!
