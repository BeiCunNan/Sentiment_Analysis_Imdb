This Film truly is awful, i bought it expecting a good HongKong Zombie-Vampire flick! great stunts wild & fast! but what you've got here is wild & utterly ridiculous! The Zombies/Vampires are like Cardboard cutouts, fake stiff dummies with NO movement whatsoever! apart from the occasional clutch of the hand! the effects are poor! really pour! the zombies don't even bite the neck from what i saw, i managed half hour & that was painful enough, really 1 of the worst vampire genre movies, & possibly the worst film i own. Avoid like the plague! Poor acting! poor film, don't be fooled by the trailer either! Not even worth a vote, my opinion, for Vampire films the Dusk Til Down trilogy(Mainly The First), and for Zombies, Resident Evil 1&2, and Dawn of the Dead(Remake Starring Ving Rhames).
