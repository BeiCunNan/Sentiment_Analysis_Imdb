i was expecting so much from this film and i have to say, along with scarface and darkness, it's the worst film i've ever seen. There is no plot, horrible acting, and pretty much, it's a porno. But, David Chronenberh really does a outstanding job directing this. It's very gory, a lot of nudity, don't waste your time. it should have been called "a history of bad movies." or something. It look like this movie really took time to make and develop, which is sad, because the outcome is horrible. I was yelling at my friend telling him this is supposed to be a great movie, so he went along and watched it. The whole movie, were sitting there wondering how this is actually a produced film. I mean, who would pay for this piece of garbage. 1/10
