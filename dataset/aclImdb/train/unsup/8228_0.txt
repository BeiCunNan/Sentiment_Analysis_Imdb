Because After I Saw This Film I Was Freaked Out Oh & I Saw Orphan About That Time. This Is SCARIER. Let Me Explain The Plot: Sixteen-year-old Alice Palmer drowns while swimming in the local dam. When her body is recovered and a verdict of accidental death returned, her grieving family buries her. The family then experiences a series of strange and inexplicable events centered in and around their home. Profoundly unsettled, the Palmers seek the help of psychic and parapsychologist, RAY KEMENY. Ray discovers that Alice led a secret, double life. A series of clues lead the family to Lake Mungo where Alice's secret past emerges. Lake Mungo is a mystery, a thriller and a ghost story. That Thriller Part...Is Sugar Coating It. Who Wants To See Man-Thing Or Final Destination 1 3 Or 4 Or Maybe Even The Strangers Or Orphan & On The Way Lets Get The Sixth Sense Yeah I Saw All Of These Horror Films. Were They Scary...NO!!!!!!!!!!(Even Though I See Alien As A Sci-Fi Not A Horror). This Proves The Fact That You Don't Have To Go Into Gore To Get Scary. Heck The Only Death In The Whole Movie Is Alice Palmer. Very Scary. The Return Of True Horror.
