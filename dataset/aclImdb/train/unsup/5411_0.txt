This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my whole entire life. I have seen some pretty bad movies, but this takes the cake. Just watching the first five minutes of this movie I wanted to shoot myself in the head, and remove my eyeballs. I mean the guy drops a baby doll to steal some mail. After that he goes on to saying "What we did back there didn't make any sense" Damn right that didn't make sense, the whole movie doesn't make sense. The worst movie EVER! Worse than GIGLI! There I said it.
