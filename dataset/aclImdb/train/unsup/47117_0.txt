This film was one of the worst of the year. I don't even know why I bothered going to see it now, but I suppose that the good reviews in UK film magazines won over my doubts. This film took itself far too seriously. It made me laugh to see all these second rate actors who never play anything else but generals and presidential advisors shout out stupid words that no one would ever say in such a ridiculous situation, until I realized that this would go on for two more hours. Then it made me sad to see actors like Philip Baker Hall, James Cromwell, Alan Bates and Morgan Freeman, who have all done far better films (Magnolia, L.A. Confidential, Gosford Park, Seven), submerging themselves in this crud. The plot was more stupid than Clear And Present Danger. What do these people have to gain from trying to start a war, as it isn't a religious belief? The film never explains any character's motivations, except that everyone either wants to save their country and their president, even on their death bed, or they want to blow up america. It was also flatly directed, attempting some form of style (no wonder it's Phil Alden Robinson's first film in ten years), which only managed to irritate, and STILL that American anti-smoking message gets through, because, as this film wants you to believe, only neo-fascists who kill innocent people smoke. So to all you smokers out there, quit before you turn into one! Or alternatively do whatever you like but please avoid this painful excuse for a film.
