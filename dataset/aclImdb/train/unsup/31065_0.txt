I wasted twelve bucks on this film that I had hoped to be an entertaining, funny but witty film with the talented Jennifer Garner.<br /><br />Instead, Matthew gave a less than acceptable performance with 'old' jokes and empty humor. Although some laughs were shed, at some points I was caught between watching 'Disaster Movie 8/Scary Movie 2' or 'Rachel Getting Married'.<br /><br />I'm sure if this movie would had been made several years ago, it would had been a riot! But being the year 2009, movies like this are overrated and the jokes are SO eight years ago.<br /><br />Take my advice and don't waste your hard earned money on this film. You aren't missing anything. Same old, same old plot. Nothing new. Nothing surprising.<br /><br />EmmaLynn
