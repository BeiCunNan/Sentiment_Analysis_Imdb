4.3/10 is generous. My biggest problem with this movie is being able to predict scenes 20 minutes in the future. My young daughter and I watched it together, and at first I was ready to change the channel if it got too scary. She had the remote, however, and during commercials kept changing channels. She nearly feel asleep before the "climax", which occurred with about 30 seconds left in the movie. The last 10 minute set of commercials came on and then the wrap up: big plot hole here, but you'll have to watch it to find out.<br /><br />As far as being nominated for B movie status, I would reserve that for movies that were intended to be good, but turned out to be turkeys. This one seemed destined for mediocrity from the start.
