"Stir Crazy" capitalizes on the previous, better film "Silver Streak", as it reunites two of the best comedians of that period, Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor. Under the direction of Sidney Poitier the film is a lot of fun to watch, but in viewing it again after so many years since we last saw it, the film feels flat, at times.<br /><br />The best excuse for watching "Stir Crazy" is Gene Wilder. Mr. Wilder is, in my humble opinion one of the most original funny man during the 70s and 80s. He was in a lot of excellent movies. In "Stir Crazy", he demonstrates his genius playing against Richard Pryor, who is the straight guy. The rodeo sequence is one of the best things going for the movie.<br /><br />The picture is dominated by Gene Wilder. Richard Pryor has some funny moments. Evidently Mr. Poitier must have encouraged his stars to improvise a lot, and it shows. This picture, is still worth a look just to watch this winning team together.
