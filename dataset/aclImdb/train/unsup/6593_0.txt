Although this film does a good job of showing both sides of the abortion issue in positive lights, it definitely has a pro-choice bias. Despite the fact that I am pro-life, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The writing is great, and the creators do an excellent job of making the audience think about abortion from various angles. From Demi Moore's attempt to give herself an abortion with knitting needles to a pro-life crowd outside a clinic, If These Walls Could Talk provides powerful images and intriguing characters. The three sections don't flow together particularly well, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this movie is a must-see for pro-lifers and pro-choicers alike.
