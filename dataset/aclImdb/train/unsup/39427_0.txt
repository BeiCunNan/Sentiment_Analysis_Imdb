This is probably one of the stupidest movies i've ever seen. After seeing Scary Movie, which I thought was great. I thought anything that ended with the word "movie" would be good. I was VERY mistaken.<br /><br />Now where do I start, well I know comedy movies can be disgusting and gross like in Scary Movie and it can still be funny, but not with this movie. Extreme Movie could be funny but it just ended up taking the sick jokes way too far and actually started to really annoy me.<br /><br />I mean, comedies can be as disgusting as they want as long as they have a story behind it and at least one normal character that can lead us through it. Extreme Movie had neither, it was just a bundle of jokes that started to get annoying quickly, 12 year old kids playing with sex toys, just about every character was some sex addict, and it was just horrible. It was a waste of money and time and the character you think may be the normal character I was talking about hardly ever comes up or does anything the rest of the movie is just about stupid people doing stupid stuff that gets on your nerves after a while.<br /><br />I could probably best describe this as a deranged orgasm in the form of a movie, if that makes sense, because I'm telling you now this movie doesn't. See my vote to see what I really think it's worth!
