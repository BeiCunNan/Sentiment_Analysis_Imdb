Holy cow, this was the best movie I've ever seen in years. Quaid was positively stunning as the android and this is easily Murphy's best performance ever, Oscar worthy indeed. Dawson looks like she is having the time of her life and all the money and production costs have paid off beautifully. This movie was hilarious, a five star performance from everyone, PLUTO NASH has instant classic written all over it.<br /><br />Set in 2087, Pluto Nash has created a successful club and the Mafia want it, the easy way, or the hard way.<br /><br />Still there? Honestly, PLUTO NASH is one of the worst movie I have come by. Nothing is funny. For an expensive budget, I could not find it anywhere. I was eagerly hoping for a director's commentary, but just subjected myself to heck anyway. There is even a 'twist' towards the end of the movie that could not save me from caring at all. Save your life and stay as far away as you can.
