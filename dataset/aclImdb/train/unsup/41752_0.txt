This is one of the MOST derivative films I've ever seen. "L'auteur" Kasdan rips off so many other great westerns (including, of course, the daddy..."Shane") that it's hard to keep count. There was absolutely NO suspense to this film, the acting was mailed in, and the plot...well, enough.<br /><br />Actually, this is a great film if you don't have time to watch a lot of other westerns. Just rent "Silverado" and you'll see them.<br /><br />A "1"...should be a zero.
