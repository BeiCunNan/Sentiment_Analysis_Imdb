Ha! Ha! What a joke. A killer guy in a raincoat goes on a killing rampage is the stupidest idea in the first place. This is the worst movie idea since Uncle Sam.<br /><br />This film is only scary for little babies. If this movie scares you, you probably get scare so easily.<br /><br />Come on! This guy kills people with an hook. Thats a big rip-off of the great horror hit, Candyman.<br /><br />No-- I didn't liked the first movie, I'd think the entire thing about the man in a raincoat with a hook is so stupid in the first place. I've seen horror movies that went only to video is better than this movie.<br /><br />So, I gave this movie 1/2*
