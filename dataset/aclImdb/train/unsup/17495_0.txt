Although there are a couple of scenes that drag on too long and some special effect errors, this film is yet another Fellini classic. I would say that this film is almost as good, but not as good as 8 1/2.<br /><br />You will laugh harder than you ever have before at a Fellini movie. The scene at the doctor's house will have you rolling on the floor.
