June 1940. As the German army invades France whole families flee through the country. It may remind you of the setting for René Clément's Jeux interdits. It's quite the same save that you feel not much sympathy for the characters. The mother (Emmanuel Béart) and her children flee and meet Yvan (Gaspard Ulliel), 16, who settles sort of a male authority. But all of them are nothing but wanderers (Egarés).<br /><br /> So what's the hook? Well this is French cinema, that is the kind most film critics leniently praise precisely for wandering. You've got a storyline leading nowhere, characters discovering nothing so that nothing important happens. Ah but the pictures are nice and there's a little sex to thank you for waiting.<br /><br />Then it's over and you wonder why you wandered into this theatre. Too late to wonder, you've already forgotten everything but you know why people go to see pop-corn movies: they forgot everything right away but they had the thrills.
