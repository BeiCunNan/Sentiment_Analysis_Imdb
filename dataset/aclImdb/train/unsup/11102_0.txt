I wanted to see "Oxygen" for two reasons: 1) The premise seemed interesting, and 2) Maura Tierney is my favorite actress. I wasn't disappointed. Though the script was weak in places, it was an interesting idea and very suspenseful. Leads Tierney, who played Madeline Foster, and Adrien Brody, who played Harry, were phenomenal. Their ability to encompass their complex characters and become them, plus the chemistry between the two, helped carry the story. I can't picture any other actors in those roles, and I think if you took away even one of them, the movie would be weaker. In short, this was an excellent movie, mainly because of Tierney and Brody. I'd give the story overall an 8, but just the sheer talent of the leads caused me to boost my vote to a 9.
