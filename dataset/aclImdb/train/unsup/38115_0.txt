I watched this movie last night and I am going to blockbuster today to demand that they remove it from their shelves.<br /><br />I was seriously surprised that there were credits at the end, people were actually willing to admit they had something to do with the creation of this movie. At some point you think someone would've stopped and said, "Hey, this is absolute crap, we should stop right now and quit movies forever." Seriously, at some point during the filming, editing, screening or any number of junctions in movie making someone should have called it off.<br /><br />The pinnacle of the awfulness was the scene at the stairs when the zombies broke through the "barricade." If you watch (not very) closely you can see one of the "zombies" flinch at a falling crate. Flinch as in, move fast to avoid something falling on your toe. I almost took the DVD out and broke it in half when, about 10 seconds later, pitchfork guy requests a bullet to the head before having even been touched by a zombie.<br /><br />Good God.
