Alright this ain't exactly Goodfella's (1990). No drive-byes, no drug use, no murder shown. This isn't a mobster film even though the main character, Vinnie (Steve Martin) is a rat. <br /><br />Vinnie finally joins the witness protection program. Being the witness too a murder in New York, he joins and is shipped of to a small town outside San Diego. Assigned to watch him is an uptight FBI agent named Barney (Rick Moranis) and everything changes. Even though Vinnie tries to help he starts to get back into the business he was meant for, crime. He buys stolen credit cards, pirates goods, and starts up an organization with a group of other 'rats' put in the same place.<br /><br />The whole while both Barney and Vinnie loose their wives to other people. Now Barney's sole job is to protect Vinnie's name and see that he isn't knocked off. Through the course of the film, Barney is taught a few things by Vinnie: dancing the Marengo, hitting on woman, and trusting people. <br /><br />The film is a few laughs to short of being a classic comedy but it is very good. This is the only film I've ever seen that actually has Rick Moranis following in love and actually an actress during the film. Steve Martin does the best acting of the cast, basing his character loosely on Henry Hill (main character of Goddfella's who actually exists) in a comical sense. the film is beautifully choreographed with the two or three Marengo scenes. The story is funny and smart. The gathering of the 'rat' mob members mite be the funniest scene in the film.<br /><br />Vinnie also goes through a bit of character development like Barney, getting out of the business and eventually to start saving up to build a baseball park.<br /><br />My Blue Heaven. Starring: Rick Moranis, Steve Martin, Joan Cusack, Melanie Mayron, and Bill Irwin. <br /><br />4 out of 5 Stars.
