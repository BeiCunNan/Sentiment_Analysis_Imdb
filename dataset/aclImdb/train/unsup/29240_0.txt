The 1942 version of "The Spoilers" is the fourth of five filmed versions of the classic tale of life in Nome, Alaska during the gold rush of 1900. The story centers around the miners and their battle with the claim jumpers and cheats..the "Spoilers" of the title.<br /><br />The film seems to have been designed as a starring vehicle for Marlene Dietrich. She plays the saloon madame, Cherry Malotte as only Dietrich could play her. Her dialogue is full of double entendres and she looks as Marlene Dietrich should with nary a hair out of place. One of the major faults of this film is that the producers failed to include a sultry song or two for Marlene to sing as she had done in "Destry Rides Again" (1939).<br /><br />The real stars of the film though, are John Wayne and Randolph Scott as miner Roy Glennister and Gold Commisssioner Alex McNamara respectively. Scott in a change of pace plays the villain this time and does so effectively. The weak link in the cast is, I'm sorry to say, Wayne. Wayne needed a strong director such as John Ford or Howard Hawks at this stage of his career. Director Ray Enright fails to get the kind of performance that they could has gotten out of the Duke. He was much better in "Pittsburgh" released the same year (with Dietrich and Scott again).<br /><br />The highlight of the film is the knock down drag out fight between Scott and Wayne (and their stunt doubles). It is one of the best of its kind ever filmed. Their is also a spectacular train wreck and shootout with the bad guys as well. Unfortunately there are several scenes involving Marietta Camity as Dietrich's servant Adabelle that have racial overtones. In particular is the exchange between her and Wayne when he appears at Cherry's in blackface.<br /><br />"The Spoilers" is blessed with an excellent supporting cast of seasoned veterans. The venerable Harry Carey appears as Wayne's partner Dextry who fires off several shots from his single shot rifle "Betsy" without reloading. Former silent screen idol, Richard Barthlemess (in his final film) is very good as Bronco a shady figure who frames Glennister for murder. Another silent screen favorite, William Farnum, who played the Glennister role in the 1914 version, plays the lawyer Wheaton. George Cleveland and Russell Simpson provide the comedy relief as a couple of miners and Margaret Lindsay and Samuel S. Hinds play Scott's cohorts. If you look close you will also see a number of "B" western veterans in bit parts. I spotted Bud Osborne as the Marshal, and Harry Woods, Gabby Hayes and Mickey Simpson as miners. And yes, that really is poet Robert W. Service playing himself in a brief cameo.<br /><br />One can't help but notice the similarities between this film and Wayne's 1960 effort, "North to Alaska", however, I enjoy "The Spoilers" more and more each time that I watch it.<br /><br />
