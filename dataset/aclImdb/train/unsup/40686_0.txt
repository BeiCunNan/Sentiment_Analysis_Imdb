All-too-typical erotic thriller that doesn't generate much heat or suspense. The plot (complete with minor "twists") is, most of the time, devoid of interest, and the sex scenes, although frequent, don't last too long (OK, I probably didn't see the unrated version). Andrew Stevens is not a dislikable actor, he's actually pretty competent - but that Tanya Roberts proves again (after "Inner Sanctum") that she's remarkably untalented. (*1/2)
