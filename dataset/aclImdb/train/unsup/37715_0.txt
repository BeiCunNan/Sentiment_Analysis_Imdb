THis movies is one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen. Brannagh or whatever his name is a hammy over actor. THis movie had some of the cheesiest overacting I've ever seen. The love between him and carter is flimsy and there chemistry is non existent. I had trouble believing any of the acting it was just a joke. THe movie also lacks consistency and logic.SPOILERS How does a doctor who can bring a creature to life for the first time in human history study it for a matter of minutes before mistakingly thinking it is dead, and then just leaving the body hanging from his ceiling. Later in the movie after he decides he made a mistake in "playing god", he refuses to repeat the mistake on someone he had cared for by turning her into the monsters bride. Yet this same moral reasoning does not apply when attempting to reanimate his murdered wife like 2 days later??? If you know it will make her a monster why would you do that to someone you truly love????just a stupid stupid movie don't waste your time
