The story focuses on private detective Raj (Shahrukh Khan) A.k.a Baadshah. He solves several "cases" then gets hired to find the daughter of a famous business man who has been kidnapped. While traveling to find her, with his group of hilarious sidekicks, he gets mistaken for a C.B.I agent whose code name is Baadshah who is on a mission to save Chief Minister Gayetri Bachchan (Rakhee Gulzar) but has already been murdered by a band of thugs working for Suraj Singh Thaper (Amrish Puri) who is financing the assassination attempt. <br /><br />And then of course there is a love story tossed in the mix between Raj and Seema(Twinkle Khanna) a C.B.I agent involved in the case. Ultimately it all falls on Raj's shoulders can he save the business man's daughter, his friends, and the Chief Minister and get still the girl? Excellent movie SRK does a fabulous job of being serious when you are just busting out laughing!<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was that in the version I have, distributed by eros entertainment, there weren't any subtitles on the songs so I had to look them up online bollywhat.com has a list of lyrics.
