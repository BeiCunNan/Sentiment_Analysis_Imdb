It was a nice film but I would really have liked the different parts to be longer. You didn't really have the time to get to know the different characters in a half an hour. A problem that most films of the genre face, I guess. There just isn't enough time to explore the different personalities. The different actors did a good job and the film was mostly well made.<br /><br />Part "1961"and "1972" was the best ones. The "2000" part was good also but the script wasn't as good as the first two. Ellen De Generes was great as usual and Sharon Stone did a good job as well but the love scene was just thrown into the plot, almost as if they had to put it some where but didn't find a place for it. The script writer could really have written that one better!<br /><br />I liked the film in general and give it a 7 out of 10.
