This movie was by far the worst movie I have ever watched. The acting was horrific, the story was absolutely painful. The plot was lacking in every aspect. the majority of this movie consisted of "small talk" between two seemingly unexperienced actors with what appeared to be an extensive amount of extremely bad "Ad Lib". Lets put it this way, when I returned this movie one of the employees gave me a free rental after "Over" apologizing for allowing me to rent it in the fist place. Don't waste your precious life watching this movie. If you already have I feel for ya! Get together with your buddies, have way too much to drink, grab a pen and paper, a video camera and by morning you'll have a film ten times better then this one.
