A dream cast, a high-gloss MGM CinemaScope production, a title song hit--what more could one ask for? A viable script! What seemed the height of sophisticated froth in 1955 (and was indeed a smash commercial hit, of which I had fond memories) is painfully unwatchable today. Other reviewers on this website have blamed the mentality of the 1950s for the now-beyond-dated nature of the film. Not true at all. One year later, Sinatra & Celeste Holm would be reunited in the still-dazzling "High Society." And Debbie Reynolds, who tries her best in a horribly written and conceived role, is still a delight in the similar 1954 comedy "Susan Slept Here," which was far from a hit in its day but now looks better than ever--especially compared to this mind-numbing disaster! Put the blame squarely on the screenplay (adapted from a hit play, God help us!). Celeste Holm comes off best, as usual, but under these circumstances, consider that feat a very minor victory.
