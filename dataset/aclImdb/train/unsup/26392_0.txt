I will say that the cinematography was beautiful. Images was breathtaking. It was upbeat, and thrilling.<br /><br />Major problem? None of the facts add up. The representation of a very advanced civilization has been torn apart and made to look like savages.<br /><br />First of all, Mayans were very advanced in calendars and time, so the eclipse that freaked out the "Mayans" would have definitely not have happened. Another LARGE LARGE LARGE mistake is that the Mayans did NOT sacrifice humans or rip out hearts. That was the Aztecs.<br /><br />The Mayan's were actually very civilized and the movie failed to capture the beauty in their buildings. They also did not paint their buildings white.<br /><br />This seems to be more about how the Aztecs would have acted, for they were much more into war and fighting than the Mayans or the Incas or what have you.<br /><br />Now, the Mayans and the Aztecs would never ever scar their bodies as well.<br /><br />I think that the reason why many people are upset is because he misrepresents the Mayan culture so much and helps stereo type all natives of Mexico as savages that really turned me off.<br /><br />If you go and see this PLEASE keep in mind that the movie holds no truth whatsoever. It may be entertaining, I admit again, the imagery was stunning. But keep in mind that you're watching a bunch of false "facts" about a very advanced civilization that already knew about the stars, the moon, the sun. They paved their streets, built grand temples and other things.<br /><br />And if you have any questions about the Mayan history, go check out a book on Mexican History. Next time I hope Gibson will.<br /><br />And I'm also Mexican, so I should know my history.
