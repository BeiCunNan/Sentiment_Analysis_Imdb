There can be only 1 conclusion, The Coens are aliens from planet KzOrp and drugged mankind with a substance that makes people like, no love! their movies. Unfortunately, I must have been hibernating somewhere in a deep cave when they did so.<br /><br />I got annoyed by the boredom I felt watching The Big Lebowski, Fargo made me want to strangle newborn puppies and after 20 minutes of the rampaging not funny dialog in Hudsucker, I simply felt depressed.<br /><br />This is in-the-face parody at it's worst, everything is overdone from acting to scenery to story. I absolutely despise movies with Jim Carrey but compared to this movie, they are actually quite passable. You know which movie came to mind watching this? > The original Charly and the Chocolat factory. Mind you, that is a children's movie.<br /><br />Who in their right minds can endure movies like this? No character is likable for it is not a character but a cartoon-figure, every turn in this so called story can be seen coming miles away and slapstick really had its highpoint way before even my former life started.<br /><br />I live for humor, it's what keeps us going right? - a deep big sigh for completely failing to see how so many people find this amusing.<br /><br />1/10!
