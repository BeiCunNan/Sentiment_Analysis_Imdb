Freak, giant lizard terrorizes the fun-loving people of a small Texan town.<br /><br />Cheap drive-in fare is what you would expect from a B movie for its time. The cast's performances are laughable, the special FX consists of a real gila monster walking around on miniature models, and the 'pop music' is wildly inappropriate, although the atmospheric score isn't bad. <br /><br />All together, it's a bad movie, but it's B-movie gold that genre fans might enjoy and will certainly laugh at.<br /><br />* 1/2 out of ****
