A masterpiece of cinema, Kung Fu Hustle takes everything from everywhere and mixes it up into a new breed of film. This is a film that sets the bar on what can be done to amaze us at a new level. Its not all amazing visuals but great story telling as well, something that will probably allow this film to live on for the next hundred years.<br /><br />The film has been compared to a Looney Tunes version of a Quentin Tarantino film, and while its partly true, it has to be remembered that Tarantino has been raiding the work of filmmakers like Stephen Chow for years and telling people its his own stuff. Here we have the real deal and the action in this blows anything that Tarantino has done, in particular the House of Blue Leaves sequence in Kill Bill, off the map.<br /><br />This is simply a great film.
