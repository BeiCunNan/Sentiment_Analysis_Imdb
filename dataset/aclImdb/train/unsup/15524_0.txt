(Hey! Judge for yourself by watching for free the whole show - yea fair use vs greedy itunes - some good sam uploaded at a livedigital video link I found: http://livedigital.com/content/637821/ )<br /><br />This wasn't picked up by CW network for good reason. After several strong seasons of Smallville, the same producers failed to learn how to create a strong pilot. The Smallville pilot was weak, but after some tweaks they strengthened the characters and improved on production values of that show. Luckily, Smallville wasn't dropped because of a poor start. <br /><br />Aquaman: Mercy Reef, however, began with a somewhat weak beginning. Mostly, the show's creators tried to cram too much of a plot into the first episode. Instead of starting with less is more, they felt that the audience needed to know everything up front.<br /><br />The pilot in a nutshell: Aquababy is born floating in Caribbean waters, Aquaboy is flying in a seaplane with Aquamommy piloting, seahorsey necklace glows to indicate underseabaddies close and causing trouble with glowing waterspouts shooting up from a dead calm sea, plane ditches underwater, Aquamommy with superwaterstrength yanks Aquaboy free from seat-restraints and kicks heavy plane door open, Aquaboy floats to surface while watching slithering seaSirenbaddie attack Aquamommy in shadows of sinking seaplane, Aquaboy is brought traumatically to surface by a pod of whales; cut to present day, Aquamantwentysomething (who looks younger/punyer than his teen Smallville predecessor) goes through a weak reveal as an angst ridden man who can't let go of his past and fears wrought by his Aquaboy incident. <br /><br />Now comes the really dumb part: everything in Aquaman's life is tied to the war in Atlantis just beneath the Bermuda Triangle where all this trouble began. Ving Rhames's character is also from Atlantis who tries to teach AC (Aquaman's stupid carryover monicker from Smallville). They both eventually trap the siren (played by Kara/evil Supergirl from Smallville) that we saw in the opening sequence and they kill her. End of pilot. Really, the very praise-be-to-Poiseidon end!<br /><br />Miller and Gough: next time, consult with me if you ever try another superhero/teen show. Don't pull this kind of stuff with Flash. My fingers are tired of typing poor reviews.
