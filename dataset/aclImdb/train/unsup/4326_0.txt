When I heard Daniel Stern speak at Lewis and Clark College in September, 2004, he explained that in the case of "Home Alone", everything was pretty ridiculous, but at least they only did it once; he affirmed that with the second one, they just repeated everything. He's right. "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" does repeat everything. And is it really appropriate to make various and sundry injuries look funny? Personally, I don't know why they have to make sequels (for the record, there was even another sequel or two after this one; fortunately, this was the last part of the franchise that I ever saw). All that I can say is: trust Daniel Stern and avoid this movie.
