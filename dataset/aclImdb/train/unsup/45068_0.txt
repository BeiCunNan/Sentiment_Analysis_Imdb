Normally, I like insider type movies, and did enjoy some of the cameo appearances of movie directors.<br /><br />However, I found the Albert Brooks character too whiney and predictable. He jumps at the idea of a Muse and potential salvation way too quickly, as if he has read the script ahead of time. Sharon Stone played a spoiled brat, and did not provide any inspiration to a character 500 other actresses could have played the same way in 500 other movies with spoiled brats. Andie McDowell's character accepted the story of a Muse vs an affair way too quickly with too little proof. I know my wife wouldn't so easily accept another woman, and then let her sleep in my bed too!<br /><br />The dialog was boring, not inspired as some have said of Albert Brooks' abilities, the soundtrack was grating (did not fit the scenes well at all), and the casting less than ideal. Albert could have used a real MUSE for this story.
