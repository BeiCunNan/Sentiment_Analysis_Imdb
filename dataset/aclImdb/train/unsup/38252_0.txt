This movie is a failure in every sense of the word. It tries so desperately to aquire the praise tarantino deserved so well. Instead it comes across as being naive and pretentious. The dialogue is absolutely laughable. I didn't think highly of Garcia to begin with, but this particular 'performance' has finally thrashed every last bit of credibility he had. Keep your day-job Andy!
