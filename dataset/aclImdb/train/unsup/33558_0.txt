Unfortunetly, I found Tuesdays with Morrie to be quite disappointing. I live in Michigan, where Mitch Albom is quite a force in all medias, so the hype surrounding the movie was quite large. However, the movie itself was so weak I was looking for other things to occupy my time while it was on. The Mitch Albom character is not clearly defined, we know he is a writer, and has a girlfriend, not much else. Morrie, played by Jack Lemmon had a lot of potential but it seemed wasted. Many of the Morrie-isms that he spouts sound like the babbling of someone that is unconcious. Lots of grand sounding ideas like "Without love, we all die" and "Don't die alone", I mean really. Morrie comes off sounding like that one sappy person in your family that everyone tries to ignore when you get together. Other quality highlights: The horrible overacting of the boy that plays young Morrie ("Oh, he's got a huge smile, he must be happy" or "He's crying, he must not be happy" is the range displayed) and the very humorous method for making Morrie 20 years younger (think Jack Lemmon with Steve Wonder style hair extensions).<br /><br />The legions of Oprah followers, most without minds of their own, will find it to be a great touching tale. Just try to go into it with an open mind, and you'll see how rank it is. (2 out of 10)
