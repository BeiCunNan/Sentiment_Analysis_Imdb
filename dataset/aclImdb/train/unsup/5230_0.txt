I have always loved Varney's Ernest character. None of his movies are real pieces of movie magic. They are mere catalysts for Ernest to show his comedy ability. I believe that Ernest Goes to Camp and Jail are the best "movie" movies of the series but my favorite for general comedy is Rides Again because of the small asides that Ernest goes into during the film. I have no doubt that these movies are incredibly annoying if you are not a fan of Ernest but I love the subtle, unrelated to plot, funny without the movie, similar to sketch humor moments in Rides Again that shows some of the best Varney humor.
