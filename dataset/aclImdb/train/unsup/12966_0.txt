When I rented this movie from Blockbuster, I thought it was going to be a good one. I saw Kal Penn's picture on the cover of the DVD and thought it was going to be funny.... NOT. Although I do think that Kal Penn is hilarious in his other movies like Harold & Kumar and Van Wilder, I did not think he was that great in this one. I thought the acting sucked and the plot was cheesy. This is a total low budget B film. I cant believe I wasted my time watching this movie. I wish I could get a refund back from Blockbuster. Anyhow, there were some cool cameo appearances from Chuck Liddell and Vincent Pastore so I did vote this a 2.
