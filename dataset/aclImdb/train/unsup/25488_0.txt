The ants looked incredibly stupid and strange. the acting was terrible as well. You'd think that they'd shut down the bomb i mean why does that guy not care about those people? seriously. and why did the ants have to be black? wouldn't it have been cooler if they were red or golden? or something like that? and that one guy the sheriff one. he had practically no lines and apparently tragically he was born without a personality. if i were you i would definitely avoid this movie unless you're looking for a stupid action movie to laugh at. and why on earth is it called glass trap? and where was the queen ant anyway? how could the ants have laid all of those eggs? scientifically incorrect.
