I rented this movie by chance without expecting much. But after watching it, I am inspired to write my first review ever! <br /><br />The movie revolves around Steve's journey from knowing that he is gay to coming out in the open. This is conveyed beautifully through his on-off relationship with the school jock, Johnny. The importance of family and friend's support in such situations is also highlighted.<br /><br />The acting is first class. Especially, the tension between Steve and Johnny when they bump into each other in a public toilet is so real.<br /><br />But what sets this movie apart from similar movies is its unique take on the subject. Movies like "Beautiful Thing" portray that society is prejudiced against all gays. But this movie shows that the society treats "elite" people differently proving that it is just another form of discrimination. Despite Johnny's friends knowing about his gay relationship with Steve, they conveniently ignore the fact and instead blame Steve for it. In the end, this only results in Steve becoming free and Johnny remaining closeted.<br /><br />Must watch for all!!
