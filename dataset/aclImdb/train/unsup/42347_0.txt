The producers of this crap owe the horror fans a BIG apology.<br /><br />There's no way they could have been serious. This was a sorry excuse for a comedy. They tried gore for no reason other than they knew the joke was flat.<br /><br />This gets one star for the idea, and another for the concert scenes. Even though the music was worse than anything I could think of.<br /><br />Deaths follow a metal band on tour.<br /><br />Did they do it? <br /><br />Will you care? <br /><br />No!!! <br /><br />Put it back and rent something else.
