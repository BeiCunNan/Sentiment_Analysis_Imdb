I have always hesitated when seeing the DVD at the video store, but finally watched it. The only thing I knew about it was that it was about robbery and a gay couple. I also knew that I was going to see the leads 'behinds', which I thought would at least give me something to be happy about in case I didn't like the movie. My fears were confirmed.<br /><br />Having seen the user rating (7.4) and read the reviews posted so far I've concluded that most of grades/reviews must be on behalf of the "real", "not stereotyped", etc. relationship portrayed in the movie. That is true, but that alone doesn't make a movie good.<br /><br />I wasn't hoping for action (which in fact is there), but for good characters, for a good, well paced story, something to think about or at least mess with something inside me - good cinema. That didn't happen at all.<br /><br />The characters are poorly developed: we get to "know" them through their "thoughts" and the narrator's speech rather than through their actions and expressions, which doesn't help much to make the viewer sympathize with them. Just being gay and hot is not enough to make a -even gay- viewer like with a character, is it? <br /><br />The relationship between the three repeats its (poorly developed) pattern throughout the movie. Nene wants Angel, who also wants Nene but feel guilty (the "voices"), and El Cuervo makes fun/gets angry at them for being gay. Then, by the end, during the shooting, it all resolves itself in a cathartic moment: El Cuervo becomes tolerant and even sort of nice, and both lovers make peace shortly before dying. Come on, only because it's a gay couple it's not a clich√©? <br /><br />And the movie is mostly just plain boring, as if the director was trying to stretch it for no reason with scenes that added not much to the plot and/or character development (and I'm not talking about "meaningful silences" either). Also the abuse of voice-over usually indicates lack of acting/directing skills to give the spoken message in a more artistic way. Plus the voice-over thoughts were sometimes pseudo-poetic and sounded pretentious.<br /><br />I don't recommend it unless you're really eager to see a gay couple on screen (and not much more).
