Evil? Err, okay, someone needs to get out more. The movie was okay in the sense that unlike all other New Zealand movies, it didn't try to dig into quirkiness that defines just about every other NZ movie out there - think genetically modified killer sheep. Watching it, I did get a little bored after about 30 minutes, but then I did a gear change and accepted it for what it was - a low budget, romp through Auckland, with some cheesy action and acting. The actors seemed enthusiastic, albeit quite wooden at times. There were a few laugh out loud moments - ie Mike making the chick disappear and the whole conversation in the dry cleaners - and there were some cringe moments as well - ie the scene with the kids mother. Watching an interview on TV, it seems that it was all done on a budget of $50,000. Yeah, it wasn't the best, and for a first effort action movie a little light on the action. Worth a watch if you are a Ketzal Sterling fan, from the days when he was doing High Octane - another cheesy product but TOTALLY appropriate for that market.
