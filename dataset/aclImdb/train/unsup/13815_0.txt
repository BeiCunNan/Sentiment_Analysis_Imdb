This one is worth it for the Mary Steenburgen, striptease scene. She normally plays the harried wife in various comedies, but this role is strictly Utah trailer trash, and it is delicious. Her husband, Melvin the Milk Man of the Year can't keep a job, so she goes off to make a living anyway she can, shuffling her ten year old daughter off to Melvin. Melvin divorces her, takes her back and she's off again mostly because Melvin spends like a drunken sailor. Paul LeMat had a number of likable fool roles in the late 70's and early 80's. He's chewing gum and singing cowboy songs while they repo his vehicles. A chance meeting with the legendary Howard Hughes, millionaire in the desert is the plot device that propels this cute little film.<br /><br />Sure, downtrodden folks dream of hitting the lottery or inheriting money from an unknown relative, but it is possible that a desperate man in real life, Melvin Dummar, may have forged himself into Hugh's will, but I doubt it. How did he duplicate Hugh's handwriting? No matter, this slice of life is just that, a little Americana from 1980.
