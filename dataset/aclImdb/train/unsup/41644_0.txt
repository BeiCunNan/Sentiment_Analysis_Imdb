this show from the UK fallows "ghost hunters" many are interested in ghost and the paranormal but these people are just wacko, they scream run and get poss ed a lot, i cant decide if they are just crazy or if they deserve a award for best actors playing screwed up people! American shows such as ghost Hunters on the Sci-fi network is a much better and realistic show, as the REAL Ghost hunters on (ghost Hunters) are out not to prove that every thing could be paranormal they try to prove some things are not solid evidence and the evidence left and cant be disproven 100% is worthy to be looked at but not at all to be consider real proof, for they know you need solid evidence and they are looking for it. to sum this up if you like watching people be stupid and run at a flash of light or a odd shadow then watch Most Haunted.
