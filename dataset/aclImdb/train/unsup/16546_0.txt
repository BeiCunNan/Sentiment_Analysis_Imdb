On low budget Aune Sand made this (50.000 $) terrible film about love over 4 years - meeting people randomly. There's no dialogue, but only the young peoples thoughts. The film is full of totally comical parts like:<br /><br />When the film opens with a REALLY long sequence with Siv Stubsveen tossing and turning in the bed for 5 minutes - and then she tell us in her thoughts - "I couldn't sleep". The cinema audience just HAVE to start laughing after being so bored!<br /><br />And e.g. later, when they think (not talk) about the American car which has been driving on dusty American desert roads since the fifties, and it is a mid-sixty car!<br /><br />The most fun part is actually noticing that Aune himself wear the same pair of ripped jeans for the 4 years the film is covering.<br /><br />You'll love the comic in France when Aune enter a coffee shop, randomly running into a former girlfriend, while wearing Rollerblades. It's REALLY far worse than anything Ed Wood would have made.<br /><br />OK! I've seen this film 3 times on the cinema, and is probably one of the reasons it became a box office hit. All the reviews did set bottom 1 for this film.<br /><br />A masterpiece for a film-club, if you want something really bad. Beware. Aune sand has been filming his Russian girlfriend for the next movie. They split up after the filming!!!
