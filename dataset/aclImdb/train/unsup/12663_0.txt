Starts off slow... so you think it's just taking its time, introducing you to the characters so you care when they (presumably) start to die horribly later on.<br /><br />Nope. It starts off slow, because that's how the rest of it goes too. Assuming you've managed to stay awake past the first 45 minutes we have some of the characters going slowly mad while ghostly sheep or something run around on the edge of their vision and random shots of environmental disasters are scattered across the screen.<br /><br />Just before you'd walk out of the cinema or fall asleep in your chair somebody finally gets killed (couldn't tell you who, despite all that build up), then they go mad/off themselves/get killed/whatever in quick succession.<br /><br />So, all self-induced mania? Well an incoming group on an aircraft crash for no reason whatsoever so they obviously had the instant version of the mania.<br /><br />Then it all goes completely to pot while crappy CGI see-through DragonMoose (tm) starts walking about and slapping people.<br /><br />Honestly, it's worse than I've described.<br /><br />Good job to the marketing team on getting all these positive reviews up here though! Two stars just for that.
