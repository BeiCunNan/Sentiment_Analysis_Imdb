OK, let's face it... this movie stinks out loud. HOWEVER, there is one recommendation: You must check out the MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 episode that tackles this terrible film!! MST3K thrives on poking fun at the worst movies ever made, the worse they are-the funnier the show is. For those who don't know what MST3K is, it's a TV show that ran in the 90's. It had a simple idea, a mad scientist forces a guy to watch horrible, mind-numbingly bad movies to see which one will make the young man crack. In an effort to keep his sanity, the guy,Joel(and later Mike)is imprisoned on a satellite. So he builds some robots who watch along with him. The three of them completely rip on these movies.The films are shown in their entirety, sometimes along with old shorts and newsreels as well.If you haven't had the pleasure of this show, look it up and treat yourself. TIME WALKER(know as BEING FROM ANOTHER PLANET,for the MST3k episode) is one of their best.
