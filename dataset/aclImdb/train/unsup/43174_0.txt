this is the most stupid movie i have ever seen. why would you take a successful movie series and make a sequel featuring no one from the cast of the other movies and give it a storyline that completely has nothing to do with the last four movies. i was totally appalled by this movie and only finished watching it because i was a kickboxer movie fan. to my belief id guess they only called it kickboxer five to bring attention to this horrible film. if you read this comment do not buy this terrible sequel. its a disgrace to the rest of the kickboxing films and in my opinion kickerboxer 5 should be removed from the title leaving it to be called only the redemption.
