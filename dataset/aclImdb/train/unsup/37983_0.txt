How can you not love a film where the invitations to the South African premiere were printed on barf bags? Especially when it has a pitch as insane as The Manitou, which sees Susan Strasberg growing the foetus of a 400-year-old reincarnated Native American medicine man in her neck and calling on Tony Curtis' psychic for help. Of course, Curtis being a phony he seeks help himself, first from Stella Stevens' gypsy and then, deciding to fight fire with fire, Michael Ansara's medicine man. Ansara gives a surprisingly good performance considering the material, but even his Indian magic isn't enough to fend off an evil Felix Silla from summoning the Devil himself, who can only be defeated by turning on every computer in the hospital at the same time and Susan Strasberg getting her tits out in a vaguely New Age Meets 2001 finale. Despite the synopsis, unintentional laughs are in short supply, although a sequence where one of Curtis' elderly customers is possessed, floats down the hallway and throws herself down the stairs is a mini-masterclass in ineptitude as it fluctuates between failed attempts at humour and laughable attempts at drama. Still, any film where the co-writer is blown up on screen and where a frozen nurse is accidentally decapitated isn't entirely without some merit.
