After seeing The Truman Show,i wanted to see the other films by weir.I would say this is a good one to start with. The Plot:<br /><br />The wife of a doctor (who is trying to impress his bosses,so he can get promoted).Is trying to finish her written course,while hes at work.But one day a strange man,who says that hes a Plumber,tells her hes been called out to repair some pipes in there flat.As time goes on it turns into a battle to see,how much she can take of this "Plumber". View On The Film:<br /><br />Peter "The Master And Commander:The Far Side Of The World" Weir, keeps the film going at a really good pace and makes sure to keep it moving fast.Unlike a film thats very "similar" to this,The Cable Guy,this film does not go as dark as that film,which helps to give it a more realistic feel.Though Weir gives it some good comedy,(like,when the Plumber does a spoof of Dylans,It Ain't Me Babe,by doing a song called-Its Me Babe!).The cast that has no one that well known in it,do a really good job to make you feel,that this is really happening. Final View On The Film:<br /><br />If you want to see a very enjoyably gripping film,then see this..
