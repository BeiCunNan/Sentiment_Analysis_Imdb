Never before have I seen assembled into one movie so many humongously breasted women. Remarkable! I gather the movie's more about the breasts than anything else, which is fine. It was a little confusing figuring out who was who in the beginning because the robots all looked pretty similar (cheesy robot masks with moving jaws almost carelessly placed atop suits and ties that are hanging on coat hangers). Also, the editing was pretty choppy and the blood and gore were filmed at a separate time from the murder scene and were on a completely limited budget, so it kinda' looked like a buxom woman looking towards the camera and screaming (about 50 times), then a quick cut to some scene in a butcher shop. This disconnect made the movie seem not very gory, even though I guess if you bought what they were selling, it was pretty gory.<br /><br />Props for the writer/director for actually adhering to a plot throughout. Some of the dialog and accents were a little contrived, hokey and derivative, but were also vaguely amusing at times.<br /><br />If you're a man who likes big breasts and are gonna have a couple like-minded buddies over for some beers, this could be a good one to watch.
