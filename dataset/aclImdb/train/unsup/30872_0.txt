If your expectations are high going into movies like this, then please, do yourself a favor and never watch a movie again. This is an Adam Sandler movie and we all know what he's like and what type of humor we're going to expect.....and this movie is no different.<br /><br />I wanted to laugh, and this movie did just that for me and more! Being from Israel, I found his jokes funny and very witty. I don't know if none-Israeli's would find half the jokes funny though. <br /><br />The movie tried to delve into the whole Israeli-Arab conflict, but it doesn't go deep enough to make much of a point.<br /><br />See the movie if you wanna laugh, A lot, but don't see it if your looking for a an Oscar movie night.
