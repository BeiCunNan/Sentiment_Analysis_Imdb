while i really enjoyed "Urban Legend" and "Urban Legends:Final Cut" i can't say the same for this one.i found it boring,pointless,and annoying.the character of "Bloody Mary" is about as scary a "Tickle me Elmo" from Sesame Street.not only that,but this thing was predictable from the get go.the first 2 were not.at least i didn't think so.this movie does have a twist of sorts,and the only reason it may be unpredictable is that it is so preposterous that no one for a minute would believe it actually happens.there's no way things could have ended up the way they did.but in this movie,they do.the characters themselves are just silly caricatures.and lets not forget the ending.illogical and unsatisfying.i'd say the acting was bad,but i don't see how it could have been anything else in this movie.overall,this movie is awful.1/10
