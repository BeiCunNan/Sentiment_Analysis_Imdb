Wow, this is by far one of the best college movies I have ever seen. It captures the social scene of college campuses better than any movie of its kind. The screen play is absolutely brilliantly written, each scene contains incredibly true to life dialogue and interaction. Justin Kanew is able to perfectly balance humor with real life drama. The storyline is not the most realistic ever, especially in this day and age of college life. However, it does shed light on the difficulty of maintaining a relationship while still enjoying the university lifestyle. The acting in this film is very solid. The actors and actresses do a terrific job portraying the life and times of college, as well as the emotions of sexual frustration and relationships. The musical score is also awesome, and fits the movie very well. Overall this is an amazing first effort for Justin Kanew. I expect to see big things out of him over the next few years and decade.
