I have to say i enjoy most bad movies that are so bad they're good but this is not one of them.this one is really bad,i thought it would be like the classic b movie the undertaker and his pals but it lacks the style and humor of that film,the concept for this clunker is a greedy nutty business man uses human flesh grinded in a big meat grinder to make expensive cat food.which makes the cats rabid killers who go nuts after eating the cat food with human flesh,Ted V Mikels who made the b movie classic astro zombies made this on a budget of $1.98,well not really but the acting is so bad,its frightening.even the cat attack scenes look fake.amazing that this makes plan 9 from outer space look like gone with the wind.Ed Wood Jr could've done a way better job directing this.if you want to waste about 90 minutes then by all means watch corpse grinders.but as a cult movie i say it is way below its mark.Ray Dannis(undertaker and his pals,severed arm)has a very brief role.and they actually did a sequel in 2000,why?
