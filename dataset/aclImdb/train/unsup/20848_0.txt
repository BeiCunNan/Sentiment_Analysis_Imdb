I think this programme is overrated, it seemed like everywhere i went people were talking about it, so naturally i watched an episode. it was okay, there were a few laughs here and there, but after a couple of episodes it got boring, it's just recycled gags and basic toilet humour and David Walliams in a dress! Vicky Pollard is funny and i do know girls like her (God help us all) but just like the real Vicky Pollards, they are not funny forever and the other sketches are the same, how long can he be the only gay in the village and keep saying he is the only gay in the village? The characters are grotesque versions of real people, which seems a good idea for comedy but after a while the level of comedy is so basic that i forget to laugh because you've seen it all before.<br /><br />I understand it has an audience but it's definitely not worth the hype, feel the same way about this as i do Catherine Tate 'Am i bothered?' 'Yeah but no but yeah...' it's all so repetitive. there are far superior sketch shows, older ones like Monty Python's flying circus is inventive, artistic and new for the time, if Little Britain represents Modern Britain, god help us all.
