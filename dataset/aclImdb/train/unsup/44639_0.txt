First of all i would like to say that the producer of this is now labeled a moron because who would make a sequel with NONE OF THE SAME CHARACTERS okay? I would like to congratulate the producer on remembering the theme of these movies which is cheerleading...there are 4 main problems about this movie 1.your movie had NO plot line, 2.how can losers win a cheerleading competition who have never cheered before 3.the writing suck and there was nothing remotely funny about this movie 4. i want my money back for renting this poor excuse for a movie.Your writers are too lazy so they jack other ideas off of movies. STOP MAKING CRAPPY MOVIES PLEASE ITS KILLING ME TO SEE GOOD IDEAS GO TO WASTE I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A Sequel TO BRING IT ON WITH THE SAME Characters THIS MOVIE SUCKS AND NEVER SEE IT, thank you lots of love me
