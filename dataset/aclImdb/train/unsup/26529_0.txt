Getting sent to prison for having a second baby even though the first one died? That's really unfair, but what a good idea for our prisons we have now. Not with that evil warden who kills people, but activating pain to prisoners who break the rules. That would be great. When seeing this film the first time, it makes me wonder why they don't allow prisoners to dream good things about intimacy, yet they allow assault by that 187 guy. It wasn't good how John was mind-wiped for not killing a man, because if he had done that, Prison Director Poe would of used that to keep him in prison for later on. So what's being pointed out in this movie is that murder is not allowed in the public, but in prison, the warden is allowed to murder whoever he wants and if a prison doesn't obey his orders to murder someone, they get punished, and they may of been in there in the first place for murder. That really doesn't make sense. Still a great film though!
