This movie had the potential to present the Bible, at least in a neutral manner, but succeeds only in demeaning Christians and making them out to be crazy, or cultists. I do appreciate the message that God will accept anyone who repents, but I wish there had been more example of Christians who are not demented. The movie does have some redeeming qualities, but they tend to be lost in the general destructiveness of the material. Mimi Rogers gave a grand performance as did David Decovney, but I spent the entire movie wondering if it was coming from a Christian perspective, or if it was just an ill conceved thriller, and in the end that question was not answered. In the beginning, I looked beyond the Christian clich√©', to the possibilities.
