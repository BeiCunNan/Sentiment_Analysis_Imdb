That movie is a piece of art, one of the best directions actually, an incredible screenplay, a very human story. Incredible actors and very very good direction. Excellent Candela Pe√±a, very hard work to create the character, you can fall in love with her in the first scene. Probably it is not an example of life, talking about the characters, but if it could happened,it was in the 70s. A very intelligent movie, rare on Spain, Im sure that Ingmar Bergman couldn't directed it better. I smiled, cried and laughed with that movie. Im really proud to meet the director in person. And I have to say him: Pablo thanks for that movie, and thanks for how you are.
