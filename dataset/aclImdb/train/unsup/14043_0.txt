The film that made James Cagney a star and even after all these years, it's easy to see why. JC commands the screen as Tom Powers, a troubled youth who along with partner Matt Doyle rises to near the top of the underworld during the prohibition era. Tom and his brother Mike are deeply loved by their Mother though the two are as different as night and day. Mike stays home to help take care of Ma and eventually enlists in the armed services as WWI is declared. Tom and Matt are the muscle for both Paddy Ryan and Nails Nathan and Tom, clearly with no feeling for others, has no qualms about committing murder which, in a fit of blind vengeance, will lead to his downfall.<br /><br />This is a wonderful film to watch. The performances from most of the cast are terrific with special kudos to Cagney, Edward Woods and Leslie Fenton. For me, what prevents this from being a four star movie is the dated overacting of others including Donald Cook as Mike and Beryl Mercer as Ma. Still, it doesn't completely detract from the power of the film and the many memorable scenes including the infamous "grapefruit in the face" moment, Tom's brutal, cold slaying of Putty Nose and the famous ending which still packs a surreal wallop to this day. As good as Cagney is in the movie, the direction by William A. Wellman may be even better. Wellman employs a prowling camera and keeps his performers in constant motion which was a bit different then most of the static direction of the era. His camera doesn't show the violence making it's power of suggestion all the more powerful. Again, I go back to the finale and as Cagney comes crashing to the ground, his shocked and stunned brother lifts himself up and in a zombie like state begins the walk to tell his mother about Tom. It's very powerful and memorable. A very vivid, unforgettable film that falls just short of being a four star movie due to some of the performances but it's something that should not be missed by film fans anywhere.
