Old-time movie buffs - and anyone interested in the Bible - should not miss this film if they have the chance to see it. It tells the stories of the Old Testament, with an all African American cast, with the gloss typical of 1930's Warner Brothers.<br /><br />Highlights include the first scenes in Heaven and just about anything with Rex Ingram. He gives The Almighty great weight & serenity; he also plays Adam.<br /><br />Acting is good throughout and some of the special effects are still fun to watch.<br /><br />
