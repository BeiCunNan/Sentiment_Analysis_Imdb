Vincent D'Onofrio's only got 4 scenes in this. They add up to maybe 10 minutes of the film. His scenes are decent, amusing, quirky as his fans have come to expect from him, but nothing particularly outstanding in his long career of solid performances. There's no rush to lay out $5-$10 to see 'The Break-Up', just have NetFlix ship it to you in a couple of months.<br /><br />Jason Bateman is fantastic as Riggleman the real estate agent. He's perfectly smarmy and subtle and amusing. Too bad there isn't more of him in this film Everyone else is pretty much a disappointment...what I want to know is if you're not allowed to connect to the alleged romance (you never really see any PDA (physical display of affection) or signs of affection and tenderness between them until it's a foregone conclusion that their 'relationship' is history) between Brooke and Gary, how could you possibly *care* about their breaking up? Vince Vaughn's a huge disappointment (he was great in 'Thumbsucker', so if you're not familiar with that film, go rent it instead). As always Jennifer Aniston did *nada* for me -- I still don't get her appeal so I can't recommend something else she's done (sorry, you're on your own here Jen fans).
