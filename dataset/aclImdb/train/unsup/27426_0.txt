It was really well made, I like movies that are like this. The stories all connect but very subtly and it hits "taboo" subjects in an interesting manner. It really shows how we are in society also, showing things that we tend to think we have to hide from everyone because of the way they react. The only part I didn't like was the ending, but thats a matter of personal judgment, some may like it a lot. Well done, and the acting was fantastic :) It's a very interesting movie and well worth your time if you have nothing else to do on a Saturday morning, he-he!! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did, because it's quite a fantastic movie. If i've repeated myself a lot it's because IMDb won't let me submit anything that's not 10 lines or more.. sorry!
