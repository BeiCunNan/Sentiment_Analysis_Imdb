I picked this film up because I thought the cover looked ok and the write-up on the back sounded okish. Luckily it was a free rental with a top twenty rental. Otherwise I would have been very disappointed at having to shell out a few quid on this turkey!<br /><br />As already said by others, it's hard to know where to begin criticising a film that fails so badly. The acting is poor, the dialogue is poor, the storyline is disjointed and poor. The main fault is that you have no concept of time throughout this movie. Did it take place over days? Weeks? Or an afternoon? Who knows, because there are no clues and nobody else on the streets apart from the actors and frankly, who cares?<br /><br />Read the rest of this review if you want, but take my advice, don't rent or watch this film. If a friend has rented it and invites you over to see it, make an excuse up so you don't have to waste 90 minutes on this! You'll regret those lost 90 minutes later on in life!<br /><br />They try and spice it up with a car chase, some explosions, some sword fighting, some martial arts, and lots of gunfire, black leather/Kevlar outfits and vampires. Unfortunately it fails miserably and my girlfriend stopped watching it after about 5 minutes. Stupidly I have this strange personality trait where I will watch something I have paid for until the bitter end!<br /><br />(Possibly Spoilers, although you probably won't get this far in the film if you have any sense)<br /><br />- The acting. Apart from the lead actor, who could possibly pass as an actor with a few more lessons (Although it's not hard to play a monosyllabic goth wandering around dressed in black Kevlar and leather.) the acting in this movie is by far the worst I have seen. They should have decided on accents at the start and stuck with them. Why try to do fake American accents and fail so badly! I had no idea which planet some of these people were from when they opened their mouth. One guy, an illegal arms dealer, does about 3 different accents in one sentence. I think he starts off as a cockney, then lapses into an American accent and finishes off as an aussie! The ex-marine changes his accent every scene. At first he starts off as an aussie and ends up as a Texan who occasionally lapses into aussie! The two oriental guys who 'try' to mop up the problem at the start are hilarious in their lack of acting prowess. Possibly a reason to watch the film! Well, for 5 minutes anyway! :)<br /><br />- The car chase is perhaps the lamest you will ever see. Two BMW Z3's on an otherwise empty road. Racing at about 10mph and set to a soundtrack, which would have been at home on a low budget porn movie. It ends with one of them driving into a wall. No real injuries except those sustained from hitting his head of the wheel. Where was the airbag? Maybe they should sue BMW, or maybe BMW should sue them for inferring their cars are unsafe in sub 10mph head-on collisions!<br /><br />- Explosions. Two sets of explosions where he blows up 2 large buildings. The first one you see absolutely nothing, not even a reflected flash in the car window that he is stood right next to! The second explosion you do see something, but it's off-centre and it lasts all of a second. Probably spent all the money on the script...yeah right!!<br /><br />- Sword-fighting...why was this even in the movie? I guess one of the 13 year olds who wrote it thought it would be "way cool" or something. Probably thought they could rival Blade if they put sword fighting in too!<br /><br />- Martial Arts.. A couple of pointless sequences where the guy playing the meathead ex-marine flips a few knives around and later one where he and the other pointless character, Gage, show off to each other!! Maybe they should have saved the money spent on these scenes and bought some fireworks for the explosions.<br /><br />- Timing!!! The meathead ex-marine is shot in the knee. Next minute he is riding a motorbike and walking!! We are given no idea of the timescale here. The main character mourns his wife, but we never saw her alive or get a clue when whe died. One minute the main character is sat at a table with his rucksack on it. Then he explains he has decided to make a Kevlar breastplate to protect his heart and the next minute it's in his hands! The storyline jumps from scene to scene and the viewer has no idea how much time has elapsed in between. It's as if they decided on the scenes they wanted to film and tried to fudge a movie around it!!<br /><br />- The main character walks around in a long black Kevlar coat and wears those ridiculously massive boots you see goths wearing with all the little mirrored metal bits on the side of the 4-inch sole. Why? I've seen people trying to walk in them and if I were a semi-vampire trying to stealth around a city I certainly wouldn't pick some cast off boots from Kiss or Marilyn Manson! This film was definitely written by a couple of teenagers who should spend more time outside in daylight hours!<br /><br />- Gratuitous sex scene...strangely enough there isn't one in this film, which is odd as they certainly seemed to throw every other clich√©d scene into it to try and make a 90 minute blockbuster! Come to think of it though...there are no women in the entire film. Well, no women who actually get on screen for more than 10 seconds and actually speak recognisable dialogue. Possibly none of them had girlfriends to put in it, or maybe their girlfriends could act and refused. We'll never know.<br /><br />If you heed my warning you will steer clear of this garbage!<br /><br />
