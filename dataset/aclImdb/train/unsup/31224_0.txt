So my brother found this video online and remembered it as one that we saw as kids on either TLC or the Discovery Channel. Scared the hell out of us, but what doesn't when you're 8 years old. So we started watching it online and we immediately recognized one of the "victims" from his role in several films and television shows. Thanks to this site I was able to verify that in a matter of seconds. So for the producers who put the disclaimer at the end of the film......I know the whereabouts of at least one of the people missing. His name is Aaron Pearl and he appears one year after the Incident in Lake County in a film entitled "Wrongfully Accused" starring Leslie Nielsen.
