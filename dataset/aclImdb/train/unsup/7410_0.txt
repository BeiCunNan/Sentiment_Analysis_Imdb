Ever since I was a kid, I have loved this movie! I love everything about it; the plot, the acting, the characters, the cheesy music, and the hilarious situations that Shep Ramsey would get into on Earth. This is the type of movie I could watch over and over again. Hulk Hogan does an awesome job as Shep Ramsey, an intergalactic warrior who never takes time to relax after a mission. Shep's superior officer suggests that he goes to earth to recharge his ship and enjoy himself, but Shep wants nothing to do with Earth. After he lands, he finds an apartment at the Wilcox house.<br /><br />Charlie Wilcox is an architect who works for a man named Adrian Beltz who steals Charlie's ideas. After Charlie and his family meet Shep, his wife and kids like him, but Charlie is a little skeptical, so he spies on him at night, whenever Shep goes out to help people in need. Charlie messes with Shep's equipment that can be traced by bounty hunters who are hunting for Shep.<br /><br />The next day, Shep and Charlie must work together to find a traceable freeze gun, but they must soon deal with the bounty hunters. In order to get his ship running again, Shep needs 40 pounds of Cymian crystal, and the only person who has it is Charlie's hypocritical boss. After the big fight with the bounty hunters, Shep thinks he is almost home, but he is dead wrong.<br /><br />Shep's old nemesis, General Suitor is back and holds the Wilcox family hostage until Charlie leads him to the abandoned building where Shep crash-landed. Can Shep Ramsey save the universe by killing Suitor for good? I highly recommend SUBURBAN COMMANDO!!!
