but unfortunately anyone else would find this to be what is it, a really quite boring and stupid horror wanna-be that is full of really bad writing and stupid coincidences. Now I didn't see this in it's original Spanish but I wouldn't go out of my way to now I've seen it. The werewolf make up looks like it came from 'fake beards and boot polish r us' and has acting to match. The worst bit of dialogue in the whole movie I thought was 'I love you with all my heart' WHAT?! you met the bloke about a day ago and thought he was lying to you before. Don't bother to go near this unless you have a real hunger for a Vampire Vs Werewolf movie with a really unclimactic climax. Oh look the devil is rising tonight, oh wait no he's not, oh well let's have a bit of a wrestle instead. Really, Really bad! 3/10 (Cause it's not the MOST boring film I've ever seen, and there's a little bit of flesh about but not nearly enough to make it worthwhile)
