OK, 3 stars is generous. The only notable thing this movie has for future generations of anthropologists is how it absolutely nails how white people in the 1980s were, just look at the fashion: pastels? Open shirts? tight jeans? LAME hair! Wow, bad, but entertaining.<br /><br />I'm sorry but I liked this movie, why? Well I first saw it on the Sci-Fi channel, then a few weeks later uneditied on Showtime, its much better on showtime, becuz then at least there is some nudity. And, watching it a second time I knew the movie, which for some reason made it more entertaining. If you are up late, have absolutely nothing better to do and aren't in the mood to have your brain work, watch this stupid movie. Yea, I know, I actually watched this thing twice..
