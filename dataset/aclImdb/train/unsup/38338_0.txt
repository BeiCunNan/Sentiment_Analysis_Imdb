Honestly one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life, truly horrific. Definitely the biggest insult in the history of war films. I really don't know what else to say about this movie other than don't watch it, the acting is absolutely shocking, the combat scenes seem as if they were without any expertise on infantry tactics and or training and it is just generally very cheesy. I personally take it as an insult to the cap badge of the parachute regiment that this rubbish was allowed to be filmed under there name and can't believe certain actors that have worked in cult classics such as reservoir dogs would have ever considered working on such a project. Save yourself from a truly painful experience and don't bother with this movie.
