Its a pity you cant give this film a zero or -1 cause that si what it deserves, i think that this is definitely the worst film i have ever seen ever in history, the whole storyline is absolutely B*llocks and the attempt to make a horror film is completely forgotten as the film progresses. the acting is by far the worst amateur acting i have ever seen, every line is forced out and each member of the cast is really, really bad at showing emotion. half way through the film i sat there dertermined to watch the film to the end, not because i was struggling to stay awake or anything like that, but simply to see if the film would at all improve just slightly. the fact this film is meant to be a horror is a joke as the attempt to make it at all scary is thrown out the window with in the first five minutes. not only am i disappointed with the film, in fact I'm disgusted that any video store would even stock this film and be willing to rent it out to innocent film lovers, all stores that choose to rent this film out should have this film in a large case with a 20ft warning sign that says " Please understand that by watching this film you are not only wasting your hard earned money but even worse you are putting yourself through what will be years of torture and torment at the realisation that at the end of this film you would have lost about 2 hours of your life that you will never get back, please approach film with great caution, also we don't do refunds.p.s. WATCH AT YOUR OWN RISK." HONESTLY though this is one hell of a boring film, i actually felt physically weak by the end of just watching it. please don't watch this film as it is extremely bad.thank you for taking my advice.
