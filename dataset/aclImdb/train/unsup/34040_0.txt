Apparently you must give it at least 1 star. It is unwarranted.<br /><br />The film is a complete f%^&ing waste of time. The film just seemed to be one appallingly long cigarette commercial. <br /><br />There is NO STORY. I kept waiting and nothing develops, luckily I have FF, can't imagine what it must have been like to have to sit in the cinema for this piece of dreck. <br /><br />None of characters even if they are not horrible people are remotely likable or appealing so I could not care less what happened to them. Chrissy died, so what? who cares.<br /><br />When Chrissy, a minor character of absolutely no interest, none of them are interesting, died my only thought was thank heaven the film is over.<br /><br />I am baffled at how such a competent cast was put together. The cast lead me to believe the film would be good Wow! that was a complete assumption on my part. I am sure they are all hoping this film will sink into oblivion as quickly as possible. <br /><br />AGAIN NO STORY! UNLIKABLE PEOPLE! Nothing that can hold a persons attention.
