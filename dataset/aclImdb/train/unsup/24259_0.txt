This will always be Adam Sandler's best movie, period. While some of he humor was really dated and sappy, the overall context made this a hilarious look at what pop culture used to be. Sandler and Drew Barrymore have consistently displayed incompetent moments of acting in their careers, they both had a sensibility which seemed real and beside themselves. I especially loved all of the bad 80s references, which added some reality to what a call a biopic of the 1980s (which also proves to be one the most turbulent decades fashion wise). A good film to keep a part of the collection.
