First of all, I am a sucker for post-1960 black and white. This photography does not disappoint. It is all to easy to look back on things now and start naming heroes. Lenny Bruce was no such thing. He had serious problems, not the least of which being substance abuse. So, this is not someone whose word is law. However, the man had something to say, and tried to say it at all costs. Dustin Hoffman nails his role. (Mr. Carney better give a mind-bending performance in "Harry and Tonto" to beat Pacino and Hoffman in some two of the best performances American cinema has seen.) The documentary approach was very effective and poignant. One of my favorite things about the film was the editing between the narrative and the performances(s?) toward the end of his career. Not only did it work aesthetically, but it was subtly brilliant to intertwine Lenny's observations with his real experiences. This shows that, right or wrong, he was coming from the heart. He did not claim to be a saint, but he saw problems in his life and America at large, and he didn't hesitate to share those thoughts. This is a stirring film with importance. Forget that you do not agree with him, at least hear him out.
