Yet another Cat III rapesploitation comedy drama shot on the cheap by some wacky Asians.<br /><br />A mother pimps out her two daughters. One of the daughters has a nice guy boyfriend that doesn't know she's a ho. He gets involved with a jewelry store robbery because of his boss's gambling debt and an innocent guy ends up dead during the getaway. He has to hideout at his girl's house for a while while she tries to hide her profession from him. This is where the drama starts unfolding Part Porky's, part Red To Kill--this sucker is pretty sleazy and was surprisingly enjoyable despite its ultra-cheapness and some lagging parts. Includes a money fight sequence with a fully nude woman high-kicking. The finale, however, switches gears and drops the mean-yet-lighthearted vibe. Recommended for HK enthusiasts--7.5/10.
