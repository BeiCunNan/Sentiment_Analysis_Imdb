Probably one of the most memorable Tom and Jerry animated shorts, has Tom the cat hopelessly smitten with his love interest at a day at the beach. Jerry the mouse, with the help of a crab (in the crab's defense he hates Jerry as well as Tom), plot to of course turn Tom's good time into a day of pain, degradation and humiliation, often with hilarious results (the clam sandwich, the sand tea, the fake wooden lady, the spit-take, and of course the umbrella spring to mind) Viva Tom and Jerry!! This hilariously great cartoon can be found on disc one of the Spotlight collection DVD of "Tom & Jerry" <br /><br />My Grade: A
