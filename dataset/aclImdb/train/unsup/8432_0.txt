"Damnation Alley" is a dumb film. I can't say it any plainer then that. It takes place after a nuclear disaster. There are only a handful of survivors left. George Peppard leads the pack looking as if he can't wait for "The A Team" to come along.<br /><br />The survivors make their way around in a trumped up camper. Jan-Michael Vincent plays the standard hunky hero. This was near the end of his successful run in the 70's. Movies like this did him in (though he would bounce back nicely the next year in "Hooper" with Burt Reynolds).<br /><br />One scene that is well done and worth noting is when the crew is overtaken by a deadly breed of cockroaches. It was quite effective on the big screen with stereo sound but, sadly, loses much of its potence on television.<br /><br />The special effects are mostly cheap looking with obvious sets in many scenes.<br /><br />"Damnation Alley" is not even a good time waster. You'll be so busy laughing at its silliness or shaking your head at the effects that it is likely to make you feel as empty as the world its characters inhabit.
