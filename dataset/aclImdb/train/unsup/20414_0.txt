I think that the movie was absolutely excellent! I think that it is even more than what I expected it to be, because it goes deeper than the first one. I appreciate a lot about the script the fact that it follows life's "precedure", so to speak: bad luck brings not one, but many misfortunes. I also think that it shows very well how it is extremely hard to maintain oneself on top once one gets there. The action sequences are meticulously combined with the dramatic and romantic moments, which maintain a certain rush of adrenaline. I definitely loved how the football matches were shot and the effects and the music was more than perfect! Sure there are some little exaggerations(some of the goal, some of the football stunts), but the shivers that one gets when seeing Raul, Beckam, Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, Zidane and other football stars giving their best on the pitch is worth every second of it. My recommendation is to watch it...and to feel it! Because football comes from the heart!
