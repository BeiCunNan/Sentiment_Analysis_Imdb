This is BY FAR...the worst movie ever. And that it is on Encore does say a lot about how sad those that do the programing for this cable channel must be. PLEASE....if you see this title...RUN!!!!!!!!!! The direct to video is even bad for this "movie"?? The acting is as bad as it can be. Often in a "b" movie there is at least one person that stands out, in this case..NOT! I have no idea who wrote this or cast it...but they really need to spend more time taking care of the customers at the Drive Thru, and not worrying about making a movie. Please, never see this, and if you do...I am sorry for you! I will say, that some of the special effects are not bad. But that really is all that can be said.
