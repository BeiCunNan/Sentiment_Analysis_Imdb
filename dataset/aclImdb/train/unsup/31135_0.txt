It's not unusual that people comment on a movie like they're looking for mistakes in the plot, or searching very deep for the weakest points in it, just to give a so-so-rating. Spiderman is one of those kinds of movies... It has some weak points, the story sometimes seems to forget one or other character, and then in the end they all come together like it was so natural. The sandman isn't such a bad guy but seems to be a bit too violent for a person who is just trying to save it's kid... a bit greedy isn't him? And if he's not a killer, why'd he agree to kill spider man so easily?... OK, you can add lots of other bad things in the plot, you'll find'em, but isn't it supposed to be an entertaining movie? Yes, and to put the bad guys together Eddie, wearing the black suit finds the sandman in a blink and make in an allie in less than 5 seconds!! Besides that, and concentrating on the action itself, Spiderman 3 has a very good pace, and most of the situations happen in a "natural" way, entertaining a lot (which is it's main purpose). The special effects are great, lots of CGI of course, but even that is getting better and better, and now Spiderman jumps and action seems more real than ever! That was one of the reasons I went to watch the movie! The black suit is really nice and it was a really good story to pick from(will it return? there is a little sample on the laboratory where Parker left it to be analyzed)... I a Spiderman fan since I was a kid, although I stop reading the comics long ago, but this movie is probably the best in the series, mainly because it's superb special effects and CGI. Because of that, all the weak points aren't enough to say "it's not a good movie"...
