SPOILERS<br /><br />Yeah, this is definitely not as good as the good movies of Star Wars. Yeah, it is better than Attack of the Clones or Phantom Menace, but not as good as Revenge of the Sith, a New Hope, the Empire Strikes Back, or the Return of the Jedi. Still, this was a very good cartoon with some action here and there. Trust me, though, you can not sit through every episode. Some episodes are so amazingly boring.<br /><br />Here is the basis of this television show. This takes place right after Star Wars Episode Two: Attack of the Clones and right before Star Wars Episode Three: Revenge of the Sith. There are two different series. This tells about some of the Star Wars's people's amazing stories during the Clone Wars. For example, Obi-Wan Kenobi becomes a general and fights a Bounty Hunter named Durge, Anakin fights a Dark Jedi named Asajii Ventress that was trained by Count Dooku to use the powers of the Sith, Kit Fisto's battle underwater, the rise of General Grevious, the real reason General Grevious coughs all the time, and more.<br /><br />Overall, this is always a fun cartoon to watch. I only have three major complaints. My first complaint is, of course, there is not not a lot of action in this compared to the Star Wars movies. My second complaint is the fact that some of the voices do not sound like the actors at all. My third complaint is the fact that this is a bit like an anime cartoon. I loathe anime. Still, this, overall, is about two percent anime, which is not a lot, but still. I also thought that the battle between Anakin and Ventress was amazing and really exciting to watch. Anyway, this is a fun Star Wars show to watch.<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />Recommended Films: Star Wars.
