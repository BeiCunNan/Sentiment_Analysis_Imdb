'About Last Night' is the story of a guy and girl who fall in and out of love, repeatedly mixed in with about an hour of raunchy, eye-crossing sex. I think the long-lasting appeal of this movie was soft porn and a popular 80s cast (Demi Moore and Rob Lowe in the leads).<br /><br />However, the love story would have been more sincere and convincing had Lowe's character not behaved like a prepubescent boy throughout the film. Demi's character actually seemed like she was looking for true love, while he just seemed to be an unsure floater.<br /><br />Resist the temptation to see it purely for the stars, you've been warned about what you're getting yourself into.
