There are moments in this film that are so amazing to me. It is hard to describe in words what occurs in this film that I find so striking.<br /><br />Kinski is sheer brilliance. It is not that she delivers a phenomenal performance but that she seduces the camera without any ego. I have never seen this done before by another actress in the same sense. It is though we were watching a documentary.<br /><br />The film is an awful mess but at the same time I found it fascinating. The dance Kinski does in her unfurnished apartment has a strong sense of an individual void of the conformity of life. She dances to the beat of her own drum.<br /><br />There is another scene where Kinski gets out of a cab and falls in the street. She gets up and runs away with a limp in her step. Why I found that intriguing I cannot say. It seemed awkward in an awkward film.<br /><br />I like it for its foolishness and its attempt of making the world of fashion and terrorism seem romantic.<br /><br />Kinski breaks the barrier between audience and screen as the magazine Variety stated. It was such a perfect description of her performance. Roger Ebert offers an excellent review on this film and I highly agree with it.<br /><br />Check it out sometime and see a star at work.
