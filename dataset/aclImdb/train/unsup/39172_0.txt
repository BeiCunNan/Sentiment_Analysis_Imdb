Christopher Lloyd's name on the cover, Clive Barker in the writing credits and a nice enough sounding titlesthose indicators were enough for me to give this film a chance.A decision I already regret. Quicksilver Highway tells two lame and tedious stories, even though the respected authors Stephen King and Clive Barker wrote them. Lloyd stars as the host and he looks like some kind of goofy masochist with a fetish for the occult. The first tale (by Clive Barker) is laughable effort in which a salesman is saved from a criminal hitchhiker by a set of chattering teeth-toy. I kid you not My little niece has a toy like that and I must say it really looks scary indeed. I didn't think it would be possible but King's story is even lousier. The hands of a surgeon all of a sudden decide to organize a revolution and they want to be separated from the body! Talking hands, peoplegive me a break! Both stories run low on creativity and they're extremely repetitiveYou'd be better of watching `The Hitcher' instead of the first story and `The Beast With 5 Fingers' instead of the second one. In the film, Christopher Lloyd keeps on stressing that his tales contain no moral at allWell, it would have been better if he also mentioned they were pointless and a complete waste of time.
