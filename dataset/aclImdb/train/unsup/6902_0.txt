Great performances, funny plot. Ghost Dog A Detective Tail (DOG GONE) is a very fun movie. Cute and fun!<br /><br />Jack Wagner ("The Bold and the Beautiful") and Daphne Zuniga ("American Dreams") Star.<br /><br />**** / 5 Story: Kyle's a police officer, and his partner is his dog, Hunter. Hunter gets killed in the line of duty, and his spirit comes back in the body of a criminal named Howie. Howie, with the spirit of Hunter in him, helps Kyle and his friend, a police vet, Amanda, in solving a dastardly plot.<br /><br />I love this movie because it's so cute to see Howie with Amanda & Kyle. Great performances of Daphne Zuniga and Zack Ward (Howie).<br /><br />Dorien Wilson ("The Parkers"), Cory Parravano, Pete Antico, David Leisure and Todd Bridges also stars!
