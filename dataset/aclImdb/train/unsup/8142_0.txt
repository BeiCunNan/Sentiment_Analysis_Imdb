I have seen this movie about 20 times in the past 10 years and love it everytime. Roger Moore did this movie in between "Moonraker" and "For you eyes Only" and it was a nice departure from the Bond character. Anthony Perkins is convincing as the hijack leader and also fittingly comical. James Mason is a bonus and charming as usual.<br /><br />The story centers around Rufus Excalibur (Moore); a heavy drinking, confident, cocky and intelligent specialist. He is like the equivalent of an ex-Navy seal of some sort. He leads a team that focuses on water dives, stealth and ship recovery tactics. Rufus is the best, of course, and expects a lot from his Men. He is never satisfied but that is some of the humor as well. Rufus also dislikes Women, is crazy for Cats and has a lot of money.<br /><br />Basically a hijack team overtakes a boat and its crew and holds 2 large oil rigs, Ruth and Jennifer, for ransom via bombs attached to them. Rufus is called in to lead the recovery and the story fluctuates between the hijackers and the crew and Rufus' life, preparation and style. The rest is primarily climactic and the adventure, action and humor all fall into place the last hour of the movie.<br /><br />If you are a Roger Moore fan, see this movie solely for that. You will be pleasantly surprised. Also, see it because it is still a solid movie after 22 years and I still am entertained after 20+ viewings.<br /><br />Unfortunately there is no DVD version, but it is for sale and possibly for rent. Give it a shot!<br /><br />10 of 10 mainly because of Roger Moore, but can still stand on its own.
