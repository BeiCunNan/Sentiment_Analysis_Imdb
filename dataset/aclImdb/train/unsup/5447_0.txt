We rented this movie because we were looking for something scary to watch, I had seen The Exorcist before so this movie looked like it would work. It was just as creepy as The Exorcist if not more! <br /><br />Some of the scenes in this movie are so shocking, its perfect if you are looking for a movie to watch in the dark and want to get scared! The screams that come out of the people in the movie are bloodcurdling, especially the older sister when she sees what is happening to her younger sister as the possession takes hold of her... it gives you chills!<br /><br />The make-up was really well done, we sat there and saw blood spurting from people and eyes getting gouged out, but it looks realistic enough to where you don't sit there and think about it being fake -- all you think about is how gross and scary it all is...<br /><br />Definitely a movie to rent if you want to get creeped out!
