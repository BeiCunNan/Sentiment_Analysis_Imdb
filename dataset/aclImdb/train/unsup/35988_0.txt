This is the danger we run into with the new breed of low priced hi-def cameras becoming more readily available...cheap, quickly made garbage. I just can't figure out how it managed to make it all the way to TV??? Was this a USC brat? The son, brother or friend of a powerful Hollywood producer? A laughable plot from beginning to end with some of the worst direction ever to make it to Network. Simple remedial amateur filmmaker mistakes, such as breaking the "180 degree rule" and lack of "continuity of motion" and much much more. I laughed at the mistakes from beginning to end. Example: 1.) Lucy lawless takes a pregnancy test...instead of the test reading blue or pink it reads pregnant! Yet she still has to match the results with the packaging before she reacts. 2.) The inertia of 1,000 locusts would not be enough to break an average pane of glass. 3.) Locust jaws are not strong enough to break through human skin, let alone devour cattle...and so on. This is just an absolute piece of trash. The people who wrote, directed and produced this monstrosity should leave their careers behind and never be allowed to make another heap like this. The entertainment industry is small and there isn't enough space for hacks like them. Now I just can't wait for "Riding in Buses With My Sister" and "Elvis".
