Annabel Chong gang-banged her way to the top of the porn industry by having sex with 251 guys in 10 hours. Did she do it to make a feminist statement, for the money, or because she simply enjoyed the act itself? The film explores all the possibilities and more.<br /><br />This documentary is more about the person behind the act other than the actual act itself. Annabel is quite an interesting character. At times she comes across as highly intelligent, and other times she appears to be highly sensitive, fragile, and self-destructive.<br /><br />The documentary is presented through a serious of interviews and outtakes, some of which can be pretty disturbing.<br /><br />The parts in which Annabel demonstrates her techniques for self mutilation, as well as her mother in Singapore discovering what her her daughter has been doing in America for a living are particularly gut-wrenching.<br /><br />A very intriguing look at a this multi-faceted / multi-dimensional character and woman.<br /><br />Recommended!
