Alejandro Springall's movie SANTITOS (LITTLE SAINTS) is a pure joy to watch. An allegory of a woman's search to find herself dressed in the symbolism of her religious faith, it's somewhat akin to Paolo Coelho's novella "The Alchemist" in spirit. Esperanza's plight to find her daughter Blanca (Maya Zapata) whom she believes is not dead is really a ruse to get her out of the strict confines of her home. The equivalent of a MacGuffin, we know at a gut level Blanca is clearly dead, but in Esperanza's mind, she is not because she has just seen the apparition of San Judas Tadeo within her oven. And in Latin-American culture, once a saint appears, you have to listen and act accordingly; after all, saints are all-knowing and have miracles to perform. For Esperanza, a miracle would be to be reunited with Blanca, but what she ignores is that saints and spirits work in special ways and put our love and devotion to the test. Visually a feast for the eyes, SANTITOS is equal parts magic realism, equal parts adventure, equal parts comedy, and equal parts visual surrealism, most notably in a sequence involving Esperanza walking into a brothel owned by a Do√±a Trini (Roberto Cobo) who has a surprise involving the worship of a cow. Dolores Heredia makes you believe in what otherwise would be madness. That she has to go so far away from home to find what was always there and come back a more complete person -- with a kind man in tow played by the masculine, regal Alberto Estrella -- is part of the fun this movie is.
