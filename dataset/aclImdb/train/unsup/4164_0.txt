This has got to be the fastest I have ever jumped at seeing a movie before. A porno puppet movie. Jeez, do I need help or what. Speaking of my mental state, I'd just like to say Let My Puppets Come was surprisingly good and made this little brain of mine pretty dang happy. The story revolves around group of businessmen who have failed in their latest business venture. Mr. Big, played by Rufus in Bloodsucking Freaks, backed their previous venture and he now wants his money back or else. Well, the guys hatch a plan to get his money back and make a little of their own. They decide to make a stag film. A skin flick. A porno movie! And that's just what they do. They even make some X-rated commercials to put in the movie as well. My fav being the one for women's hygiene, called Sweet Fish. Well, the movie is a nice lil treat for fans of the bizarre, fans of porn and definitely fans of Meet The Feebles. It's got bestiality and some nice puppet bj's. Can't go wrong with puppet bj's now can ya? No siree Bob. So if you're in the mood to check out something really goofy and unique give Let My Puppets Come a chance. 6.5 outta 10
