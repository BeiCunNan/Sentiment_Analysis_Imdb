I selected the film from a sat.TV guide as a light entertainment, knowing absolutely nothing of it in advance and not having seen the original film. The opening sequences have greatly surprised me with scenery from my hometown Prague, complete even with Czech flags on one building. Later display of Danish flags could not dispel the confusion in the national identity the film was trying to portray. Same goes for signs on buildings and minor items like car registration plates. It appears the film was made on a shoestring budget, or else the film-makers could not wait another day till the Czech flags, displayed for national holiday or a prominent festival, were taken down before shooting city scenes. The plot was rather simple and predictable, the acting wooden overall, the heroine looked older, less attractive and lively than her opponent. I could not believe the lack of research that allowed a reference to a "5000year old Danish monarchy" into the dialog. Do not bother to watch unless you are a tourist who loved Prague during your visit and want to see the scenery again.
