This film is without a doubt a complete masterpiece, and the remake has nothing on this work of art. This film does not rely on gore to scare people, but pure disturbing scares, sounds, and an atmosphere that cannot be matched by any film. This film will go down in history as one of the all time greats that completely changed cinema.<br /><br />The sad thing about this though is that not many people saw this film that are a part of the new generation, except they saw the new version of the film and refuse to see this masterpiece because it's old even though to this reviewer, this film is without a doubt a timeless masterpiece that will never be topped no matter how hard anyone tries.
