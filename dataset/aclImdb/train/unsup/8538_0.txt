the acting in this is remarkable. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, John Malkovich, Frances Mcdormand and Tilda Swinton are flawless in this. directed and produced by the Coen brothers, so knowing all that you all know your in for a treat. the brothers have made better films but this is far from there worst. now for everyone of you that have seen the trailer to this and got the impression that its a laugh a minute film that you can watch with all your friends, its not. yes it is pretty funny but it has a fairly complex story to it. now i hope by saying that i don't give the impression that i'm discrediting the film but the funny parts in the trailer are about the only funny parts in the film. but i didn't want to watch this film for the humour. i wanted to watch it for the big cast in it plus the directors. this film is very well made by them. everyone should see this film .......8/10.....j.d Seaton
