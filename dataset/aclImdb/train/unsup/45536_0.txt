Seldom have I seen a film this bad, no matter that the book it is based on is one of my favorites. It begins OK, but then turns into a bad slapstick movie, dated in every way - even Ed Wood's films are better!<br /><br />Nothing basically wrong with the acting, nothing very wrong with the photography (the colors have aged badly, though), the sets, or the wardrobe, but it is far more dated in every way than any other film I can think of. Very fiftyish, very safe, very boring!<br /><br />Ken Annakin has made a few good films throgh the years, like "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines, or How I Flew from London to Paris in 25 hours 11 minutes", but this is definitely not one of them!<br /><br />As a whole the girls do a better job than the males - even when trying to laugh the the three men just sound very amateurish! Their battles with the tent and the boat is just silly, not funny, and as my wife commented: "Men can be stupid, but not that stupid"!<br /><br />Overall, the dog wins as best actor, by a wide margin!
