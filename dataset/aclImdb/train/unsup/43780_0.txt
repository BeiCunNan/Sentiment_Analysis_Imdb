A beautiful, young, American couple goes to England because of a mysterious business proposition and because the movie takes place there 'cause it's always gloomy and foggy and coldish and this is a supernatural thriller in a big house and finally because most couple in these derivative though sometimes enjoyable outings are a bit on the slow side. Anyway, they get there through a generic boosting an atrocious "this-is-the-incongruous-love-song-theme-get-use-to-it-it'll-come-back-throughout" and then the legacy unveil itself, literally.<br /><br />Well, let's just say lovely Ross and tough Elliott fared better with their subsequent collaborations adapting Louis L'Amour stuff. I must say that after seeing that "Legacy" film, I'm a bit confused; I find myself wandering what the hell did they saw in that shallow script devoid of suspense, unexpectedness and more importantly of defined characters. One have to pay the rent (or the ranch) I suppose.<br /><br />It's a real shame 'cause I'm one of these freaks who loved Mrs Ross' Stepford Wives so the possibility of seeing her in another fantastic/horror flick did thrilled me. And there is the result, a messy, badly acted, confused and sometimes laughable supernatural outing directed with laziness by the late and usually reliable Richard Marquand (Eye of the Needle, The Return of the Jedi). The pit.
