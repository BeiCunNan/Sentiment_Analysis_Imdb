This is my first time watching one of the series of 'The Eyes' by the Pang brothers. I must say this movie spooked the hell out of me. It's set in Thailand after the foursome went for a holiday trip to Genting Highlands. I guess Thailand has Asia's most amazing stories of the supernaturals. The movie is based on 'The Ten Encounters', which are 10 ways you can see or communicate with the dead. The spookiest must be the 'bend down and you'll see the spirit's face'. This, in my opinion is true because my late Grandfather used to experience this himself. Other than that, great use of CGI and stuffs. Many people, however, dislike the way the movie ended. Climax died, just like that. Argh. But don't give this movie a miss - a must see!
