Bad acting, bad special effects, bad script, bad direction and very bad editing. Was there any reason to make this movie?<br /><br />John Astin had his approach on Gomez. Raul Julia, instead of playing Astin's Gomez, made a character of his own. But not Tim Curry. No. Maybe not his fault, after all. This was supposed to be Julia's third installment as Gomez, had he not died. The "producers" may have been obsessed with the idea and wanted Julia's Gomez, anyway. Curry imitated Julia's Gomez and payed poor homage to his predecessor.<br /><br />Darryl Hanna as Morticia? Back in the day, I thought a blonde was a stupid choice for playing the character, but back then I didn't know Carolyn Jones was a redhead herself. Hanna would have been an average Morticia, if it hadn't been for the wig shifting places above her head. Sometimes her forehead looks so big, its creepier than the Addamses.<br /><br />An advice for the guy playing Fester: "There is such a thing as OVERACTING". <br /><br />The Wednesday girl tried so hard to be creepy, that her acting career is over.<br /><br />Pugsly was OK, if you don't count on his excessive baggage.<br /><br />A bad movie overall. Even for a TV movie.<br /><br />Sorry for the people who bought it on VHS.
