When we all thought that the western had lost its appeal in our modern day and age, HBO came with a title that definitely proves otherwise. With the stunning visual imagery of a Sergio Leone flick and the sex, intrigues and violence of ''The Sopranos'', they make the genre come to live as never before. <br /><br />''Deadwood'' tells the distinctive story of a little village that strives to stay a free haven for mobsters and corruption. Big corporations, hoodlums and authority figures all want a piece of it, but local mob leader Al Sweregan ( Ian McShane ) is stopping them with his cunning tactics and violent methods. And then there is local lawman Seth Bullock ( Timothy Olyphant ) being as idealistic as bendable towards the law. Others are the emotionally damaged Calamity Jane, the sweet natured Charlie Utter, the Jewish friend of Bullock Sol Star, grieving widow with a drug addiction Alma Garret, and the whores Trixie and Joannie Stubbs. This is just a small grasp of the colorful bunch of characters that this show has to offer.<br /><br />I adore this show for being painfully raw and oddly sensitive at the same time. People aren't exactly nice to each other, but that doesn't stop unusual friendships and relationships from occurring. People are neither good or bad. Their choices are all based on the need to get things done, even if it has a negative effect on the lives of others. And sometimes there is no other option than to be cruel. This show really portrays our ambiguous nature as human beings.<br /><br />Thanks HBO, for another great show that became one of my favorites!
