because there's nothing else worth seeing!<br /><br />The plot makes no sense, the acting ranges from bad to REALLY bad (even Jeffrey Combs!) and the dialogue...well, let's put it this way...Ed Wood would be proud! The only reason to see this crap is the gore...there's tons of it (I'm really shocked this got by with an R rating). There's buckets of blood, plenty of severed body parts and a lot of violent fights were people are hacked up left and right. Great stuff :). Also the film is (technically) well done. It looks just great and there is an occasional good shot or two (one shot on a train was truly incredible). But, all in all, the movie really sucks! If you're into horror films and get a kick out of blood and violence (like me) this is for you. Otherwise, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!
