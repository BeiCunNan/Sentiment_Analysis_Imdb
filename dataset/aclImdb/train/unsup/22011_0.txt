As always it is the complainers that are the first to comment. I personally thoroughly enjoyed the film. Surely a films aim is to entertain? Well this one did the job as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />Has something similar been done before? probably but who cares, and without knowing how it was shot you (or at least I) couldn't even attempt to judge how innovative it is. All I know is that it felt very different to watch than most movies you will see. As for the comment that this genre is dead... what a load of tripe, this is not some Quentin T rip. It stands alone as an interesting story with some good twists and plenty of humour (assuming you like your humour fairly dry) Was it a low budget flick? almost definitely, does it look "cheap"? not at all. I think this is a breath of fresh air for the industry within NZ. And I firmly believe it is a good quality, entertaining flick.<br /><br />Is it the best movie in the world? of course not... still I liked it better than at least one huge blockbuster I saw recently. Mind you some people apparently can't live without huge explosions and/or a festival of CGI! If you enjoy the flavour of the "british gangster" type flick, and like your humour dark and dry you will probably enjoy this film.<br /><br />So go check it out you will probably enjoy it. Plus you are supporting genuine NZ film.. i.e. not financed from half a world away with the money and talent disappearing offshore the day it wraps. Oh and it might pay to watch to the end...<br /><br />PS I can't wait to see what these guys can do with the next film and some cash support behind them!
