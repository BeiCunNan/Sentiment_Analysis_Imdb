This movie continues the tradition of great Clint Eastwood movies. The Enforcer is filled with Harry Callahan's dry humor and tough talk. 1976 San Francisco is filmed beautifully and provides a great background as usual. The music is suitably funky, perfect for the period. Much better than what passes for entertainment these days. We took them all for granted back then. You must have this movie to complete your Dirty Harry collection. It's one of the 3 best of the series.<br /><br />Great bad guys, and DiGeorgio, his partner, played by John Mitchum, Robert Mitchum's brother. Tyne Daly makes her first major appearance, and handles it well.
