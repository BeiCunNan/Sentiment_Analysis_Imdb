Movies like this where a group of friends are on a road trip to nowhere and then something goes horribly wrong in this case crystal lake's Jason, are nothing new. Girls in these movies are just there to ride their boyfriends or most of the time tease guys. You'll see a lot of boobs in this movie and sex of course like there's not enough porn over the internet or elsewhere. During these scenes it appears as if Jason is watching from behind a tree or something and masturbating, when it stops he recalls oh i'm here to kill 'em. Then these killers, generally speaking, develop a bond with these girls they abduct and do not kill while providing them everything so that they can break free and run, at times taking a hell of a beating at their hands yet doesn't kill. The next time the killer(Jason) finds her somebody else gets slashed in trying to save her. This happens until more lives are laid down, protecting the girl and you ask why ain't she dead already? that's the funny part.<br /><br />Now that you'd see and Friday the 13th is no different maybe some parts. Killings are exaggerated, he/she would be dead when machete pierces their bodies in the first place. Acting is not needed here as you'd probably know but i hate to admit Julianna Guill made quite an impression in her topless sex scene and is the only thing to look out for in the movie. Also Jason brutally murders his male victims though not so brutal with females Why? trust me that takes away even the fun of watching violence. Well i won't recommend it to the readers, rest...is up to you guys.
