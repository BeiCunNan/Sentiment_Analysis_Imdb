Wow! This is one of the best movies I've ever seen! Beth Bates is amazing, and absolutely stunning!She is by far one of the most talented actresses I have ever seen. Though I have seen her in many other things besides this. She is extremely beautiful. Seth Green is also great, as he is in every movie he has been in. I would definitely recommend taking a look at this movie. This movie will freak you out. It is very scary, and will definitely make you question reality. Though this is a "low budget" film. The director does such a good job, that you can not even tell. This is definitely a great cult film...and if you like getting scared,i would definitely recommend seeing this movie
