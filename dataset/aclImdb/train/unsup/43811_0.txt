The only thing I want to say about this movie is this.<br /><br />I never left the theater before a movie had ended. For the first time in my life I had the urge to leave after having only seen a quarter of it.<br /><br />Bad movies normally become very funny. "First knight" even surpassed this criterium. For me, this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, alongside some low-budget Chinese ninja movies, which were hilariously funny.
