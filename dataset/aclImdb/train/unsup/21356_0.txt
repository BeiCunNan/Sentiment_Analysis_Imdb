Weird tech no soundtrack. The real horrifying thing about this movie is the acting and the script. I think the Pang brothers are out of ideas. So they rip off ideas from other movies like the "Exorcist" and the "Blair Witch Project". Their other effort "Tesseract" rips off the "Matrix". What a disappointment from the previous "Eye" movies. I wasn't too crazy about the second movie. This movie makes "Eye 2" look like freaking "Lawrence of Arabia" The only really good thing about this movie is this one is only 80 minutes long. I really hope the Pang brothers put an end to this series of movies before its too late. Imagine them making more sequels like Friday the 13th ? Or making Eye movies until it really hits the 10th ? Scary thought.
