Even from the opening credits, I knew this movie would be enjoyable. Unlike most movies, the characters (no matter how minor) were entertaining, it was thought-provoking, and it had an actual PLOT. Despite all the violence, there were even some parts where I was laughing hysterically. The only thing I would advise is: if you don't like to watch movies with gratuitous sex, drugs, and (extremely) excessive violence, don't watch this movie. Otherwise, go ahead.
