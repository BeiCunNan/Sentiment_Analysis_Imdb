This is one of the few sequels that is actually better than the original. Perhaps the bit bigger budget and better makeup effects are an asset there.<br /><br />To the poster that claimed this is a "trainwreck" movie. I disagree. If you truly knew your b-movie history, you'd know that Hennenlotter NEVER takes his movies seriously. There is always a little nudge and a wink to his movies. They are equal parts cheese, dark humor and monster movie. they are played more for chuckles and giggles than scares.<br /><br />SEMI-SPOILERS: This is a fun little movie about Belial and Dwayne (who didn't really die in the first one, rather ended up in the hospital) finding their way to a house of freaks, where they fit in. Eventually Dwayne starts to feel left out and wants to be "normal". He falls in love, as does Belial.<br /><br />Along the way they get entangled with a tabloid reporter who wants to expose this house of freaks. They also run across a huckster sideshow scammer who's trying to capitalize on a fake freak show (he claims to have the bones of Belial) and of course gets a visit from the freaks.<br /><br />The babies at the end is a great twist as are a few of the other twists (especially Dwayne's girlfriend revealing why she isn't "normal".<br /><br />Another cheese classic from Hennenlotter. Rent this along with the original "Basket Case", "Frankenhooker" and "Brain Dead" (Not the Peter Jackson movies that is a/k/a "Dead Alive") and enjoy a Hennenlotter triple bill. I do agree the third one wasn't in the same league as the first one and this great sequel.
