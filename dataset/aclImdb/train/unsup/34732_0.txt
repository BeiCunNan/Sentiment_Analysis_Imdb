Joan Collins always has the same role in every movie which is snotty and a bitch. Well, here is the best of the worst of the movies that she has been in. The special effects look really really bad. There were some fake ant farms that were suppose to represent the barns and stuff. I could see the ants leg hanging off the edge. Then the ants were rolling around in the sugar and sugar was all over them. The acting was so bad that I was rooting for the ants to win. Then the queen ant farted on everyone's face and that was hilarious. There were some scenes of them going down the river in a boat just like in "Deliverance." I was waiting for the banjo to start to play. No such luck.
