Magnificent, in a word, not for the dude who is going to sit in the corner and say 'oh look how far fetched that is, look at all that CGI, this is so unrealistic', that is the brilliance of this film it is well and truly rip the crap out of the films which try to hide their CGI scenes with the good old chin wag, this film goes all out action, forget a good old nip to the toilets or a steady stroll to the popcorn stall unless you are still at a dated cinema which has intervals which always spoil the drift of the film because you are sure to miss a key action scene which all the guys you went to the movies with wouldn't stop talking about on the trip home. Key roles from Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti were very much so treasured by the film, Owen who finds himself chucked into a very forceful memorable scene with him taking on a gang of street goons after the life of a pregnant woman, and Giamatti playing a very imposing laughable 'Pussy with a gun' see's the film make great use of CGI, great acting, comedy, action and a odd bit of story to make a sight for sore eyes. One which will give forth coming movies a new style of script, this could be the start of something new, a new genre of filming pleasure has brought its first cards to the table. Like crank meets matrix on steroids, one for Mr Woo, an ecstasy of adrenaline.
