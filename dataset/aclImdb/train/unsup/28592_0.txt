I am in Blockbuster the other day looking for a good slasher flick to watch and saw this one with cool looking video. So I checked out the back and a story about the teens of Sugar Hill High really interested me, as I was interested in seeing another high school one. Small spoilers follow, but nothing that'll give it away.<br /><br />The opening in the gym looked extremely promising and I was just getting ready to watch when only 5 minutes in they go to the abandoned house and it went downhill from there. The dialogue reeked, the acting sucked, the camera work stunk and even at times appeared like a cheap porn, and there was now real clear story to it. You knew from the start who did it, but they continued to try to screw with our heads even after the killer was dead.<br /><br />I wouldn't even recommend watching this movie, as I have seen better done by a high school class.
