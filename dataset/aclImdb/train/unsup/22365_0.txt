The only reason I watched this film was because of Megan Ward but I'm glad I did. The film is good to pass the time I like these types of flicks. I think it can be compared to 'Wild Things' its got a ton of plot twists and some twisted humor.<br /><br />Well worth the watch. The cast is good as it needs to be with the two female leads doing well. All the film needed was an actual 'scary' bad guy figure none the actors came across that way.
