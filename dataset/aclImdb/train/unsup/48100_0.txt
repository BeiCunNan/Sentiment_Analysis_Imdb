A terrible waste of celluloid, Ruzowitzky's "All the Queens men" is even worse than one might expect. The screenplay is unimaginably stupid, with scenes that don't connect at all to each other. The acting is really bad, and that's no surprise, because there is not even one decent character in the script. How could anyone ever have thought that it was a good idea to spend money on this film? It also seems like Ruzowitzky had no idea at all what he was doing, because the film changes from a pseudo realistic "bad times in world war II" drama to a silly, unintelligent, extremely stupid pseudo "comedy" all the time. The film looks ugly and cheap (the vfx have to be a joke) and is just a waste of time. DON'T WATCH THIS FILM!<br /><br />It's not funny, it's not suspenseful, it's a piece of crap. One can only hope, that Ruzowitzky won't ever make another film. Same goes for the producer and generally everybody who worked above the line on this abysmal heap of rubbish.
