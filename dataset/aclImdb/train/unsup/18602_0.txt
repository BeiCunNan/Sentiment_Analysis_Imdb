Daffy Duck can be both a little annoying and fun to watch, and this is one of the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons where you just love him. Disney created their own animated version of the famous hero years later, but this is much more hilarious fun. Daffy plays a wanted Robin Hood, who is just prancing singing and playing his instrument, when he slips down a hill falling into a pond. We see Friar Tuck, Porky Pig, laughing hysterically as Daffy gets out, and he decides to teach Porky a lesson with his (buck and a quarter) quarter staff, but he hits his beak twice before the Friar comes to stop him, get him in the lake again, and Daffy joins laughing for a bit. When Porky has calmed down he asks Daffy if he knows where Robin Hood is, and Porky does not believe it is him. To prove he is Robin Hood, Daffy suggests robbing a rich man of his gold and giving it to a poor sole. Of course, this does not go smoothly: he can't fire an arrow, swing through trees and avoid a rock, drop a demolition ball, fire a larger arrow and stop the castle gates dropping. In the end, with Porky convinced he's just not Robin Hood, Daffy decides to "join" him instead as a Friar, and it ends with them shaking hands, and Daffy's beak going up again. Daffy Duck was number 30, and Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies number 20 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!
