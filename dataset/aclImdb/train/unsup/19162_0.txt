I watched this for my English class and it portrayed some very interesting themes, still affecting todays world. The conformity, the outbreaks, the restrictions.... its all very real, and that's what I love about it! The only thing stopping me from giving it a full 10, was the fact that I didn't like the ending very much, even though the suicide was a shock, the whole thing about Mr Keating getting kicked out didn't entertain me at all. Another part of the movie I don't think is adequate is the scene in which Knox Overstreet is at the party with Chris. Although the part of him getting beaten up was funny,I don't think it was necessary to show him getting drunk.
