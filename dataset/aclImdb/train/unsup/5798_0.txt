I loved watching this show back when it first aired, and I loved watching it recently on DVD.<br /><br />I noticed that as the show came to an end, that 3 episode in particular seemed as attempted spin-off pilots for some of the cast.<br /><br />Season 5 Episode 19 "Lost Resort" Seemed like a pilot for a Willie Aames spin-off series.<br /><br />Season 5 Episode 23 "Almost Family" Seemed like an Ellen Travolta spin-off attempt.<br /><br />And Season 5 Episode 25 "Fair Exchange" looked like a Nicole Eggert spin-off pilot.<br /><br />Is it just me, or did these really do look like Pilot Episodes for shows that never came to be? All 3 were directed by Scott Baio, so they might of just been attempts by him to get into the director's chair, or it might of been in his contract and the producers let him do whatever he wanted. But they seemed like spin-offs to me. Of course, they never came to be. Of the 3 the only one I think would of had a chance at a half season is Fair Exchange, but, the acting was terrible in it. This shows how worse the other two were. All in all, they were interesting concepts, maybe with a re-format they might of gotten picked up.
