I thought this movie was very refreshing and original.<br /><br />Adrian Grenier, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Joey Lauren Adams all gave convincing performances, especially Gellar whose performance I see as a real departure from her other roles.<br /><br />This movie is definitely for the 17 + crowd as it contains blatant sex scenes and drug use but it's definitely worth seeing.<br /><br />It has an original plot, innovative filming and hilarious dialogue in parts. Although containing scenes of drug use, the movie is not really about that.<br /><br />You have to check this out when you get the chance... 7/10
