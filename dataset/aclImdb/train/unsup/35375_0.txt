Notice that the tag line for this movie was "If the God's were crazy now they've gone berserk". Yankee Zulu is considered as a movie in "The Gods Must Be Crazy" series of movies. This film is much different from any other of the Gods Must Be Crazy films. The only similiarity is that it takes place in South Africa, like the rest of the films. A major miss in this film is that it does not contain N'!xau the bushman, and it is not by Jamie Uys. This is the last U.S. based film, of the Gods Must Be Crazy series. The rest of the films including, Vampires Must Be Crazy, The God's Must Be Funny in China, and Crazy Hong Kong. So if you were expecting N!xau the bushman, in another hilarious adventure, this is not the movie for you.
