One of the best old house murder mysteries.<br /><br />I loved this and I can't wait to see it again. As the reviewer on IMDb says it confounds your expectations by allowing things and people to survive and for events to unfold differently then you thought... (Read The IMDb comments after you see the film since they give too much away) Basically this is about an old guy who was going to give his fortune away to friends and relatives because his grand daughter can't be found. His daughter and he broke years ago and he wants to reconcile with his closest living relative.<br /><br />Just as he's about to give the money away the lawyer shows up with his grand daughter... everyones gift is taken back and the natives get very restless...<br /><br />Complicating matter is the sudden arrival of the grand daughter to ... yes another girl claiming to be the grand daughter shows up with a stage magician in tow...<br /><br />Murder ensues and things get very tense and very silly as a masked man tries to kill again... I have no idea if its possible to really deduce who did it, but it doesn't matter it just great fun.<br /><br />Its wonderful and only 65 minutes long.<br /><br />This is a gem to treasure with only one false, very false romantic note, it like how the hell did that happen? It must have been a contractual thing.<br /><br />If you want to see a great mystery see this movie. I can not recommend it highly enough. If you find it in the bargain bin get it. This is worth every penny you'll pay for it.
