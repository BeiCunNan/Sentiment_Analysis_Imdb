In the early hours of this morning, I couldn't sleep so I surfed the several HBO channels and there it was. One of my favorite movies. There was Pandora in all of her nutty glory. The scene in the Italian home where they were eating just made me nuts! Okay, Olympia Dukakis and Paul Sorvino were miscast, they were obviously as old as the two stars. But funny and adorable! The scene under the Brooklyn Bridge where they finally admitted, in all of their angst, that they loved each other. An autobiographical movie, obviously.<br /><br />With regards to Renee Taylor, I have a copy of a book that she wrote several years ago "My Life On A Diet." The writing is just as wonderful as the writer, just a wonderful piece of comedy, just like her.<br /><br />I would just like an explanation as to why this movie isn't available to the millions of fans of these wonderful people.
