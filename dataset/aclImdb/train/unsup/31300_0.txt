I first saw this movie when I had a trial subscription to Showtime, and a brand new VCR, and I recorded it in VHS. I really enjoyed it, and have watched it many times since (until the VHS tape gave up the ghost). It IS a feel-good, ridiculously romantic comedy, very much enhanced by the bit performances of Gielgud and Richardson, especially his interactions with his pet rat that runs free inside the family chapel ("Ratty Old Fellow"). The lawyers' scenes make the movie worth watching as well. And the girl is ethereal. Acting ability be hanged. This movie, among several others, kept me sane while attempting to cope with my divorce several years ago. If Sleepless In Seattle moved you, give this one a try.
