Probably the only show I enjoy watching on Wednesday nights, and one of my favourite drama/crime shows of all time. Although sometimes the endings are a little confusing, I love the chemistry between the characters and the dry humour in the show. Abby is probably one of the best characters, but I love Ducky (who talks to the victims), Tony (silly and naive but funny) and Gibbs as well. I will miss the playful interactions between Tony and Caitlin though. They were the best parts of seasons one and two.<br /><br />NCIS offers an insight into forensics (like CSI and its spin-offs), incorporates America's military dilemmas within it (Islamic Militants, the war in Iraq etc) but is full of sparking fun and comic edges. I highly recommend it to all
