Two questions arise when watching a film mixing these 2 genres. First, what makes anyone think these 2 can be compatible or symbiotic? On the contrary, they are mutually exclusive except in rare cases - "Home, Sweet Homicide" is an exception which comes to mind. For the most part the components of the one nullify those of the other.<br /><br />Second, what were the qualifications for a screenwriter in the 30's? This picture had some of the lamest dialogue and contained so many non-sequiturs that much of the plot was unintentionally funny and many gag lines fell completely flat. On the whole it made little sense and was a chore to watch.<br /><br />Saving grace here was the surprisingly able cast and better-than average screen credits which signified a superior production - but which was wrecked by and uninteresting final product. I gave this one a rating of 3 and it was richly deserved.
