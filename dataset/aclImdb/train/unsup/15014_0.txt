Fun was had by all and a real joy to view. One woman on your show looked similar to our Anne Murray here in Canada. She married her partner and I love the rose/gardener reference. Marriage certainly goes like that for my husband and I too! I, of course, am the rose and he the gardener. We are straight as flipping arrows and watching the cruise families emulated the behaviors and family dynamics that we practice was so much fun that the time went too fast. My daughter is gay and that was difficult for her to tell me. I take responsibility for that. Children learn what they live. When I was a younger woman and gay women were attracted to me I would pump the biblical premise as well because it worked for me. They kept their distance and I didn't have to deal with what came up for me! Interesting because plenty of years later I became a minister and my teacher is a married gay woman. She has taught me how to live happy, joyous and free! Still straight and straightened out. Source Mother/Father God knows us each and every one as individuals. Thank you for taking me off the "Biblical Stand" and placing me in the Grace of Being who and what I am and knowing gratitude for LOVE one and all. No separation! Bless You All
