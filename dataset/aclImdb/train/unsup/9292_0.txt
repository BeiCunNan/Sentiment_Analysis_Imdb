I like some stupid movies for various reasons;a favorite actor or actress,a setting or plot involving something I find interesting,or I need a laugh after a hard day or night. Prince Valiant ye benighted swine is not one. Sterling Hayden is sooo out of place while James Mason decides he'll earn his money in spite of what's given him to perform. (His distinctive voice would've been perfect speaking as either Gandalf or Saruman) And that herd of "studio" Vikings stampeding over each other with the horned helmets, Kirk Douglas and Ernest Borgnine's characters from the movie The Vikings,must be cringing in Valhalla. Never did like Robert Wagner. He belongs in that class called stars or celebrities pretty can recite their lines on cue,but ever call them actors. It's like watching Alan Ladd in his fading days attempt to become a swashbuckler in the Black Knight,or horrors James Stewart as Spartacus! If you want to see Barbarians storm a castle watch Kirk Douglas's The Vikings or Charlton Heston defend one in The Warlord, only if the infotainment commercial gets truly boring watch this.
