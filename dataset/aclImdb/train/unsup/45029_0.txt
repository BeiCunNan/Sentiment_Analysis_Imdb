Soda shop teenagers Don Sullivan (as Reg), Jay Hawk (as Morrie), and Mitzie Albertson (as Julie) discuss waterskiing and horseback riding. Hay-brained Mr. Hawk decides to go riding with girlfriend Nan Green (as Dotty) while the others join Paul Pepper (as Skip) and Brianne Murphy (as Pam) for water sports. The four boaters wind up stranded on a mysterious island. There, the waterskiing couples lose their boat, and are held captive by glamour-gowned doctor Katherine Victor (as Myra) - she wants to turn the teenagers into zombies! <br /><br />Jerry Warren's "Teenage Zombies" is a very poorly produced, sometimes fun film. The storyline is silly, but easy to understand. Communists want to turn the United States into a bunch of zombies. They might have considered letting nature take its course (but, then, there wouldn't be a movie). An ensemble cast, led by Sullivan, plays the material very well, considering the script's obvious idiocy. Hawk does a surprisingly good job as "Morrie". And, Ms. Victor is a hilariously hospitable hostess, offering soda pop to her potential zombies.<br /><br />*** Teenage Zombies (1959) Jerry Warren ~ Don Sullivan, Katherine Victor, Jay Hawk
