I saw this film randomly the other day while at a friend's house. She comes from Indian decent and had always nagged me to watch tamil films with her but I always declined. Being a general film fanatic, I agreed to watch this film, not expecting much. But as soon as I got into the story (and got over the horrible and sometimes non-visible subtitles) I was completely hooked! Whether it was the directing or the wonderful screen presence of the actors, somethng about this film had the ability to capture the emotions of the viewer. I can say that having been used to watching generally Hindi films, february14 is a romance that stands out from the typical Hollywood love story -- paying attention to detail and character development in a way in which I've rarely seen before. Although I was quite new to Indian "musical numbers" in which they incorporate within their films and even found the performances in them a little bit on the cheesy side, I throroughly enjoyed some of the songs as well. Great melodies, especially the title song'un peyar ennada' -- which added to the emotional impact of the movie itself. I wll definitely be looking out for more Indian films in the future.
