I thought this movie was a fantastic rendition of the events that took place in the bible. Val Kilmer did a wonderful job as the voices of Moses and God. I was very impresses with Hotep and Hut. They really gave the story a darker side. The tenth plague was drawn so well, I fell in love with the movie immediately. My favorite part was when Moses saw the burning bush, and when he parted the Red Sea. It was all drawn so well, that you could automatically lose yourself in the movie, and not want it to end. I however did not like when Moses accidentally killed the guard on the structure. It was disappointing to know that Ramases thought he could make it all go away.
