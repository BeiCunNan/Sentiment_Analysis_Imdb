Marshall is the kind of President referred to a change in the U.S. foreign policy He took a great risk when he stated that America will no longer tolerate any terrorist government His policy is soon put in practice when he boards his plane on his way home <br /><br />Once is in the sky, 'Air Force One' is hijacked and currently controlled by Russian radicals who ask for the release of their leader or they'll execute a prisoner every half hour <br /><br />Harrison Ford is the action hero making his way through the plane taking out few terrorists, managing to free several hostages, trying to get to his wife and daughter who are prisoners on board <br /><br />Gary Oldman almost steals the show as the head terrorist Ivan Korshunov who takes over the president's plane<br /><br />Beautifully directed by Wolfgang Petersen who controls the action with his usual extreme intelligence, building the challenge with captivating, tense sequences from every compartment of the huge aircraft to the White House contingent in Washington
