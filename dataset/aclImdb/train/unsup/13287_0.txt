First off, Izo is a well shot film that seems a bit heavy on the peyote at times. The movie begins as the title character is crucified and executed. This is actually the end to the movie Hitokiri, which stared the late, great author Yukio Mishima.<br /><br />A healthy dose of intensity is in every scene as Izo fights his way through space and time to fulfill a grudge he has against aristocratic leadership and its treatment of the world. Even religion falls into the category of aristocracy for him as he blames the lie of the existence of higher beings for some of the worlds shallowness, weakness, and delusional concepts.<br /><br />There are random flashes of stock footage of World War II, and other times which are viewed as vast injustices. This is easily misinterpreted in such a way that Izo seems to be the embodiment of hate, and rage and therefore these events would invariably have a connection to him. These visions are the reiterated results from the unjust world and leadership he hates so much. All of these human fallacies provide further justification for his ultra violent actions.<br /><br />Another nearly random occurrence is the music of Kazuki Tomakawa. I don't mean that one of his songs keys in during the action, but rather he bursts onto the movie set singing and strumming his guitar with nearly unparalleled intensity. It looks as though he's going to break his guitar, burst into tears, have a stroke, or all of the above at any second. If you don't like the sound that's one thing, but no one will ever accuse the guy of not putting feeling into his music. His presence is ignored in the movie until the end when he gives Izo an order to "punish them" as he points to the ultimate hierarchy which Izo has been hunting. Without looking too deep into this, the musician is a part of Izo much as the random woman he encounters is. While she is Izo's missing duty and regret, he is Izo's passion. The philosophy stated in the final dialog further confirms this. It has to do with painters and artists being madmen, and doctors their audience. The fever and raw feeling within Izo is demanding retribution.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting ideas forwarded during the entire film occurred within the schoolhouse scene. The first thing that catches the viewer's attention is that Izo doesn't kill the children. This seems strange at first because he kills nearly everyone he comes in contact with. These obviously weren't normal children as they spoke a collective philosophy which mostly had to do with downplaying the limiting ideas and boundaries which human beings have placed on the world. It was an interesting scene which deserves a few repeat viewings.<br /><br />I only have two complaints about this movie. One is that it is slightly lengthy in several scenes which could have been cut for immediacy and pacing. Even that can be argued against as those scenes have some artistic value. One scene, however, had no artistic value, or any other value for that matter. I refer, of course, to the Bob Sapp scene. Without being too judgmental, that guy is a worthless sack of s#!+ who has the acting skill of a jar of mayonnaise. Not only that, but his scene included an terribly cheesy bit of computer animation. If you haven't seen it, just fast forward that section.<br /><br />This is a pretty stellar film otherwise, and it's worth several viewings.
