Back in the 30s, Doctor Burke (Mark Rolston) tried to treat teenagers suffering from craziness, but his methods proved more deadly than helpful, and the other patients killed him.<br /><br />Now, in modern time, the building is now a college dorm. Six unwitting students - each with their own deep, dark secret - have the dumb luck to be living in that dorm.<br /><br />We got our stock characters, including the survivor girl Madison (Sarah Roemer), the brooding bad boy with the heart of gold Holt (Jake Muxworthy), the shy computer geek String (Cody Kasch), the whorish Ivy (Ellen Hollman), the dumb jock Tommy (Travis Van Winkle) and the Spanish kick-butt-and-take-names girl Maya (Carolina Garcia). One by one they become victims (or survivors) of the mad doctor, with only one outrageous way of killing him.<br /><br />Let's go through our checklist of horror movie clich√©s: 1) Stock characters - check 2) Characters with seedy pasts that you know will come into play - check 3) A cop who has no clue what he's doing - check 4) A creepy janitor who knows the whole history - check 5) A supernatural killer - check<br /><br />Yep...basically this is just yet another horror flick that will be easily forgotten an hour after watching it.
