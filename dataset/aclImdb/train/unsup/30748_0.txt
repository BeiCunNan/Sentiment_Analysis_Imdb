"Tombstone Canyon" (1932) combines an above average story with Ken Maynard (the all- time best movie cowboy) and Cecilia Parker (Andy Hardy's blonde sister). Plus it was filmed in California's spectacular Red Rock Canyon State Park (Canti, CA.) which was to become the scene of countless western movies and many of the 1950's western television series. All these factors make for an excellent combination as this early sound film is a very entertaining feature of slightly less than 60 minutes. <br /><br />The film begins with a wrangler with only the first name Ken (Maynard) fighting off ambushers in Tombstone Canyon. Ken gets unexpected assistance from a cowgirl named Jenny Lee (Parker). Jenny rode out to meet him at the request of the man who requested that Ken come to the area for some information about his identity. Ken does not know who his parents were and has never adopted a last name. <br /><br />Tombstone Canyon is a spooky place that most of the locals avoid because they fear a spectral figure called The Black Phantom. The Phantom was been systematically killing cowboys from the Lazy S. ranch, and frightening everyone else with his banshee like scream.<br /><br />Ken and Jenny must contend with the owner of the Lazy S who wants him dead for some reason; and tries several times to frame him for murder. The town's sympathetic marshal refuses to arrest Ken, believing in his innocence and reasoning that the best way to solve the mystery is by giving Ken a free hand to investigate. <br /><br />One thing to avoid is the 1990 VHS version being distributed by MNTEX Entertainment and titled "Classic Westerns". This is the one with a pair of Tombstones on the cover. They used a truly horrible print of the film and most scenes are so dark it is difficult to follow them, let alone pick out many of the details. Probably the worst commercially released print I have ever run across. Hopefully the other versions and the DVD are better.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
