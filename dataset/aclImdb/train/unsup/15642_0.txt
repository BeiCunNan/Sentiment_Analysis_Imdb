AH, B movies from yesteryear. It's just fun to see the lingo, fashion, mores and values of society's past. The Brute Man lies there along with zirconias like Attack from the Giant Leeches, Giant Gila Monster, Monster A Go-Go, and The Killer Shrews.<br /><br />Rondo's called the Creeper for a reason...maybe he should've been called the Staller. Slower and slower, the Creeper (YAWN) induces terror. Plus, did the fire escape scene have to be shown EVERY time??? SHEESH! Also learned that blind women are capable of looking beautiful. The scenes with the inept policemen are deplorable and watch the slipup when the Lt. flubs a line at the station. So bad is this movie, they couldn't afford a second take. Hell, let's just include the error, his career's going nowhere! MAN, all this pain because of chemistry class!<br /><br />By the way, I don't know why I watched this.
