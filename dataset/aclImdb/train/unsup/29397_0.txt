This is a cheap looking Italian drama about three girls who are taken hostage by three criminals. It really isn't that interesting, although there are a couple of enjoyable moments. The girls take revenge and kill the dudes cold, but that isn't where it ends. The final sequence is one of the only parts that leave an impression.<br /><br />I stumbled on this movie by accident and watched it once. There were some lengthy sequences that did not keep my attention. It was gritty and poorly lit, and not very scenic.<br /><br />It starts out kind of carefree, as the three girls are on a vacation bus with a group, but stay behind from the rest to hang out at a beach house. They meet three men and it's kind of cozy for a while. The movie changes tone midway when the girls find out the men are wanted. <br /><br />I think I only watched this because it was an obscurity. There are plenty of mainstream movies that are more fun than this.
