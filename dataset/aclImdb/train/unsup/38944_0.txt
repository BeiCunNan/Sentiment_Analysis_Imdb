The problem with the movie is it *looks* too much like a film school project. And so the only people who like it are the crew, friends, relatives, and suckers who want to "support the industry" by being positive... not unlike the support you give a 3 year old child who vomits in your lap.<br /><br />Some improvements could have been made on the editing front. The hell visions in the beginning... overdone. The uninteresting scenarios such as the creep giving those girls at the caf√© a hard time. Come on! It's not that hard to create better, more dynamic and curious scenes than this!<br /><br />And just when I thought the bar was as low as it could go, Cory Rouse stepped on the set and opened his mouth. His material wasn't great to begin with, but his delivery was worse.<br /><br />Not bad for $15,000, but then again... it's quite bad.<br /><br />It seems the next generation of good filmmakers are not exactly bursting out of the film schools are they.
