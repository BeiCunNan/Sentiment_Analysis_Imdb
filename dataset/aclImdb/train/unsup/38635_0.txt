Despite the excellent acting performances, this movie merely narrates its events step by step, peppered with flashbacks of Danny and Mariane's happy moments. There is no character development or exploration, no substantial background on the setting, and little depth in the story. On a minor point, Angelina Jolie's hair is pulled up whether she is awake or asleep, in or out of bed, all the time. What actual person has her hair up literally 24/7? Overall, the film is boring.<br /><br />If you want to watch Angelina Jolie for her skillful acting, you may want to see this movie. The other actors do a great job as well. Otherwise, it is not worth the time.
