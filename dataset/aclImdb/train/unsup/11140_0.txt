Don't you just love these lazy sunday afternoons ? Just laying around your house and do absolutely nothing but watching TV...Unfortunately, I couldn't find the remote when this thing started. I was laying in my couch and the remote was nowhere near...I didn't want anything to spoil my lazyness so I kept watching it. <br /><br />It was...errrr...CUTE ! Being a 22 year old-fashioned male who wastes most of his time by seeing horror and foreign cult films, I don't think I was part of the target audience this movie tried to reach. So, I also see no reason in bashing it completely. The cast and crew tries so much to bring tears to your eyes. All typical elements are included : the poor girl who just lost her mommy, the workaholic dad who forgets his daughter's football match, the ugly duckling at the office who turns into a beautiful swan ... I'm not being cynical, I'm sure you will cry when you're a young girl (aged 8 - 14) or a lonely housewife ( age 30-55) but if you don't fall into any other category, you'll just watch at it and don't move a muscle. Either that or you have emotional problems...<br /><br />The cast is filled with "I've seen him/her before somewhere" - faces but I couldn't put a name to those faces. Usually this means they're washed up actors and actresses who can only get jobs in inferior family Disney movies. Except for Tyra Banks of course...She's playing the role she was born to play. A life-size doll !! She's dumb, na√Øve, ignorant but oh so beautiful and perfect. Her job is to walk around and look hot and she can handle that perfectly well. <br /><br />The overload of sentiment, morals, drama and unfunny comedy almost made me puke but still I didn't got up to look for the remote. ( That's a good sign by the way...it means this movie is "bearable" till the end )<br /><br />The monday after, my little niece told me she saw it too and she said she never saw a better movie...so, you see, it's all relative
