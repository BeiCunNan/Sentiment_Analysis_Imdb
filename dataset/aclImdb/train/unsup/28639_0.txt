Recap: Lamont Dixon is a former fire fighter that saw his best friend being killed in a fire and then switched job. Now he works as a tugboat captain and also is the custodian of Eric, his killed friends son. Now he has a job to tug an unpopular oilrig out to an oilfield off Californias coast. But things take a turn for the worst when environmentalist protesters turn out to be terrorists intent to take the rig with force.<br /><br />Comments: If you have seen Under Siege with Steven Seagal you have seen this one. You need to switch the battleship with an oilrig and then it almost seems like an identical copy. However, you got to give the movie some credit as it actually recognizes this itself and makes some jokes and references about it.<br /><br />Otherwise it is an average action movie. You get your fill of fighting, gunfights and explosions as well as some quick dialog delivering one-liners and jokes however how bad the situation. You don't need to think too much about it, indeed you only need to be conscious to see this one. That makes it perfect to see it an early Sunday morning, half asleep in your couch/bed as I did.
