I like the way they presented the story because it is the fist time that I watched a movie that is taken from an actual UN meeting. However there are lapses in the story that makes me think that its makers failed to connect to the audience.<br /><br />This part is absolutely ridiculous. A black man claiming to be an ambassador of Motabo, Africa has a name plate "Philippines". This is an absolute ignorance on the world's demographics. Our country is 80% Malay and the rest of mixed ancestry such as Chinese, Japanese, Spanish among others. There are no afro-American-looking people in the Philippines. And this country is located in Asia. They should have placed any other African countries other than the later.
