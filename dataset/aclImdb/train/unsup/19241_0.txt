"Tears of the black Tiger" is a one of a kind western from Thailand. In fact it's the only other film I have seen from Thailand besides "Last life in the Universe. Miramax owns the U.S rights to the film, but for some odd reason it was never released and continues to collect dust on their shelf. The film has a bright Technicolor style similar to "the Wizard of Oz" and Guy Maddin's "Careful". O.K., so take these bright surreal elements and add over the top Peckinpah / Pete Jackson style shoot outs, a romantic story and musical interludes. In other words, you're prepared for an experience that is out of this world.The best way to describe it is ... a hilarious and romantic candy colored spaghetti western with Asian cowboys and bloody shootouts. If you are searching for something completely different and original, you came to the right place.
