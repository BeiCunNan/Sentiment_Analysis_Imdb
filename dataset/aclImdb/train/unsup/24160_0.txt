I have always been mildly interested in the Loch Ness monster-it makes for a good story, as this movie proves as an old man relates to young tourists the "truth" of the creature in the lake and transports back to WWII and a family who had lost their father and husband to battle.<br /><br />It's a classic scenario: lonely boy raises animal. Usually it's a dog or a deer, but hey, what's wrong with a mythological creature? While this is not quite "Babe" level, it is still reminiscent of that same innocence and charm. Crusoe, as the creature is called, is the cutest little monster to grace the screen in some time. The kids are cute and hold their own in the child acting. I enjoyed the romantic tension between the adults, and I appreciated the contrast of the innocent magic and the terrible reality of the war.<br /><br />I also found it well-shot. Not Oscar-worthy, but there is something captivating about a swim through the Scottish lake This is a great little family film that has a bit of something for everyone.
