1st watched 12/4/2007, 2 out of 10(Dir-Stuart Gillard): Silly, titillating story of two young people alone in the desert being chased by a slave trader who wants the female, played by Phoebe Cates, to be his concubine. They run into oasis's as their being chased that become their temporary paradises as they play out the teenage horny version of "adam and eve." The movie starts in a city in the middle east and they are both accompanied by adult companions but as they are in route to get back to their own countries, the slave trader kills their entire group except Phoebe's companion and Willie Aames, who plays the male young character in the story. Phoebe's companion soon dies off and they are left alone to fend for themselves. This is the when the titillation begins as we get to see Phoebe nude bathing and all of a sudden Willie's characters only interest is getting into Phoebe's pants and then turns into a spoiled adolescent who isn't getting his way. Willie Aames is absolutely horrible in this film acting debut(which is probably why he didn't do much else in the movies) and Phoebe's OK when she's given a decent line. But most of the time the script calls for her to giggle at Willie's antics and de-robe whenever possible. I can't say I dislike the disrobed Phoebe, but a complete movie it doesn't make and it seems like the makers run out of ways for this to happen so they end the movie. Well, I guess I am exaggerating a little, because their was a storyline but ultimately it becomes secondary to the subplot of adolescent sexual discovery in the desert. Good movie to have around for an early 80's sample of the attempt by Hollywood to make kiddie-porn but as a movie it doesn't hold up.
