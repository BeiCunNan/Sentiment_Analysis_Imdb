Commentator 'vranger' of the United States is obviously full of him/herself when it comes to intelligence and the ability to understand plots, thrillers, intrigue, mysteries and scripts, whilst justifying abracadabra, mumbo jumbo and plain junk. (Thank you...I had to get this out of my craw first in order to prevent serious gagging after reading 'vranger's arrogant drivel.) In short, this film is a flop. Not because of the story per se, but because: 1. director Avnet of the B-variety, has problems to stick to the basics and instead tries, probably with an award in mind, to create a work of art, and 2. the script (which should have been used as 2-ply by Pacino in his powder room after reading). Midway through the film, I was totally bewildered as to who in the hell was who. An endless stream of bland females, appearing too short a time for the viewer to remember their faces and/or their actual relevance to the story. Mix that with nonstop cell phone jangles & calls, and that's how it to pass that I ended up in the category of ignoramuses so perfectly defined by commentator "vranger'.
