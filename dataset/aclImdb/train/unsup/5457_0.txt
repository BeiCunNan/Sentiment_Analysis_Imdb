Saw it on LOGO last night. Foreboding, but not with that kind of constant tension that is so taxing about thrillers generally. I kept wondering if things were going to turn out well or not. Take a few steps down the story, things are looking up; then a another and they gets spooky again. The mix of sex, danger, longing, and uncertainty was just perfect. The acting, directing, and execution were really well done. I can't remember a time I was so engrossed in a film. It was like I was in the shoes of the main character- asking myself his questions, sensing his feeling, and, oddly, making his choices. Remarkable.<br /><br />I'm surprised by some of the criticism written on here. I guess if you demand that LGBT films provide some kind of cheerful morality tale or insist that every movie with LGBT characters must have some universal gay community message, you'll be disappointed with what you get with this film.<br /><br />But if you take it on it's terms, leave your baggage at the door, and just go along with the ride, it's just so well done you can't help but be swept up in it.
