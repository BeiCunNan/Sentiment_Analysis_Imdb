This was horrible! Millions of people? The earth opens up? This movie description was so misleading and untrue. I expected a truly grand scale disaster, man against nature perhaps, with only brilliant and heroic ways to save the victims. Sand? How scary can sand be? Woohoo. I wasted two hours I can never get back. Cheap special effects, errors in editing, bad acting, poor sets, costume errors, and a cheesy, flawed storyline. Characters were superficial with little depth and finally a sudden family bond and understanding develops in a Disney like fairytale ending. This is so bad, even for a made for TV production. Just a suggestion to run away to all those who are interested in this movie.
