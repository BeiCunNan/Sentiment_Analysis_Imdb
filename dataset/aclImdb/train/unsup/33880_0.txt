When I think of all the teen flicks during the early 90's, one that will stick in my head as an example of how this decade tried so hard to recreate the 80's teen classics, is Pump Up The Volume. This movie was a sad attempt in trying to create a teen-flick with a message and turned out to be a really bad mix of Good Morning Vietnam, Lean On Me, and MacGiver all roled into one. Slater shows little of the acting potential that he supposedly has and you quickly find why Samantha Mathis joined Mary Stuart Masterson and Molly Ringwold in that "where did they go? list". Considering that I'm an actual disc jockey, I can say that most of what you've seen in this movie, while remotely possible, isn't in reality. Plus, I'm having a real tough time believing in the school getting away with what it has been doing. Please, allow Slater to leave this movie as a forgotten step in his superstar-in-the-making process that seems to never end. The upside to the movie is the soundtrack that has the universally heard Concrete Blonde song, which never appears in the movie, sadly. This flick barely got a 3 out of a 10.
