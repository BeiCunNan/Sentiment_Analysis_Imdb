I tried so hard to take the movie seriously, but being from the City where it was filmed, it just seems they took the complete mickey out of the city/culture etc... and every time I was nearly taking it seriously again something else "local" happened that we couldn't stop laughing at! I will agree it was a good attempt, but way too clich√©-ed! The accents were awful and bore no resemblance to authentic Cork accents. As previously commented on, I'm sure it will be a hit in the States, but for anyone in the know, it will be a cringeful experience. I just feel that they put the scenes together and no one "proof-watched" it. All in all it tells of a true Irish tradition, but overly and badly dramatist.
