Senior citizens can be shrill, depressing, and very boring, so you might think a movie that casts old people as 'hit men' would be good for a few laughs. "Homebodies" tries but fails. It's just a silly film about greedy land developers trying to knock down the house of some stubborn old people, who in turn start picking off the workers in an attempt to stop construction. All the characters are annoying caricatures that'll be grating on your nerves after the first 15 minutes. Save yourself the trouble of searching out this movie and just go volunteer at a nursing home.<br /><br />3/10
