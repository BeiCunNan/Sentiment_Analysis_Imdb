Having not seen season one, I was unsure of how I would react to Hex. I didn't have to worry though, as I found Hex season two to be absolutely brilliant. After the first episode I was hooked, tuning in every Sunday to see the next episode. In my opinion it is one of the best series on TV at the moment. It has humour, suspense, horror and can sometimes be plain shocking. Much darker than Buffy and seemingly made for a more mature audience it also deals with the problems of teenage life. A great program to watch on those dull Sunday evenings. Jemima Rooper is superb as Thelma and was easily my favourite character from the first episode. The characters are likable and can be very easy to relate to. You just don't see shows like this very often anymore and it is a real breath of fresh air. Bring on season three!
