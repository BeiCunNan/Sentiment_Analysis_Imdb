"Wildcats" is a football movie that is pretty predictable, but nevertheless it's very entertaining. Goldie Hawn gives another one of her many funny film performances here as a girls high school track coach who's always dreaming about coaching football since she grew up on the sport. Well her dream comes true. Actually, not all true. She does get assigned to coach a football team, but its for a rough inner city high school in Chicago. Predictably, the players hate her at first, then they start to like her and at the same time the team starts off losing before they finish up winning. There's not much originality in "Wildcats" but since it's alot of fun so what. Hawn is fun and is surrounded by a good cast which includes Swoosie Kurtz as her best friend; James Keach as her ex-husband; Jan Hooks as Keach's current wife; Nipsey Russell as the principal of the rough high school Hawn's assigned to; and (before becoming famous) Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes as football players (these two actors would later team up for "White Men Can't Jump" and "Money Train"). "Wildcats" isn't a great football movie like the current "Remember the Titans"; it isn't as funny as the football themed comedies "The Waterboy" and "The Replacements"; but it has alot of laughs and is alot of fun. <br /><br />*** (out of four)
