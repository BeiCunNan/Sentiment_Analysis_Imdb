Well I am quite well read on this period of history.And unfortunately I don't feel this film portrays the period well at all,Tim Roth,as good as he is is other roles,was,in my opinion totally miscast as Oliver Cromwell..history shows Cromwell to be a strong minded,gruff,honest,happily married Huntingdon Farm owner who rose through the ranks of the army to become commander in chief,and who trained his army to be the best in Europe.Tim's portrayal comes across as a greedy,power mad weasel.I'm afraid if it is a history lesson you are looking for then watch 'Cromwell' starring Richard Harris (an excellent portrayal)..but if you choose to watch this film,then take the history aspect with a pinch of salt.I can't really imagine a statue of Mr Roths version of Cromwell being erected outside parliament and being heralded a great Englishman.
