The teenagers Gary (Leon Ford), Brad (Charlie Garber), Emily (Lenka Kripac) and Tracey (Alex Vaughan) travel in a Kombi to a desert paradisiacal beach and spend the weekend together, the boys expecting to surf and have sex with the girls. When they arrive, they meet the older Zippo (Steve Le Marquand), and they have the sensation of Déjà vu with weird events, feeling that they had previously been in that place. Along the Saturday, they see that they are actually trapped in a nightmare.<br /><br />"Lost Things" is one of the best surprises I have recently seen on DVD. The refreshing and original story has a great screenplay, direction and performances, basically in one location, three actors and two actresses. I started seeing this low-budget movie not paying much attention and I really expected a stupid teenager slash-movie, with lots of gore and naked women. I was completely wrong, and I found an intriguing story, following the pattern of a David Lynch film, and showing an absolutely different view of the Limbo. I saw in IMDb that this is the first feature of the unknown director Martin Murphy, and I really expect to see his next works. Last but not the least, I would like to congratulate this director, the writer Stephen Sewell, the actors and actress for their excellent performances and the crew that made possible this engaging little gem. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Férias Selvagens" ("Wild Vacations")
