I watched it one of its advanced screenings this afternoon and as expected it turned out to be quite a movie.<br /><br />Based on the classic novel by CS Lewis. Four London children are sent to a professors country home in order for protection during World War II. There they find a magic wardrobe which leads to a mystical land called Narnia, which is being ruled by an evil witch. To defeat the Witch, they must join forces with Aslan, the lion God of Narnia, and the great battle between good and evil that's pretty much the whole story.<br /><br />The acting field was average (not surprising really), Swinton was okay but not top notch kind of stuff. All the kids did a wonderful job and if i can recollect correctly thats more than what i could have done at such a young age.<br /><br />The special effects were above average to excellent and tell us just what you can do if you put enough effort into it. <br /><br />I guess you can call it LOTR for kids and i would absolutely agree with that.<br /><br />Overall an excellent family film and if you are a fan of the Harry Potter franchise then you should be able to dig this quite easily.<br /><br />P.S got my fingers crossed for the next film.<br /><br />9/10
