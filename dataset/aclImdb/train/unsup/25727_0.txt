Well-made with excellent performances, but not at all what was promised. I had hoped to see a self destructive man who was changed by his circumstances and especially by a wise woman. While that happened, it only happened because he was facing death! What a cop out! ANYONE would embrace strong spiritual guidance when forced to cope with a very early end to their life. I thought the movie really missed an opportunity to make its point. Resorting to such a time worn clich√© made the writer/director seem lazy. If I'd known the whole film was a promo for Buddaism, I would have skipped it. I'm surprised so many writers on this site were so impressed. Yes, it's not the typical Hollywood fare, but that doesn't automatically make it a great movie.
