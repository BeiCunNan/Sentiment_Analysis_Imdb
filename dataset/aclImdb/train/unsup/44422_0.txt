This "movie" is a pile of random video footage mixed together! There is no logical order! I don't understand anything that happens in this movie. I understand that some stupid ass ghosts/zombies/ghouls or something like that come and mess people up every thirteenth year and then it is just a blur! It would have been a good idea to make a more simple plot! Or am I just so stupid that I don't get it? But anyway if someone understands the plot please tell me! <br /><br />Now let's talk about the special-effects... They suck! If you can't make special-effects don't make them! I think everyone who has seen this "movie" remembers the scene where the zombie/ghost/ghoul/thing hits a man with a brick and there's blood splatter in the camera... classic! <br /><br />And now let's talk about the acting! I thought it was quite good... If the cast of Ghost Lake were the only actors alive! And even then they would suck! Everyone can act as good as them. They just suck. But the child actor irritates me the most! She say's the lines like this:"Himynameissomethingsomethingilikeponysanddogsandcats..." If you can't get a decent child actor don't make a movie that includes children! <br /><br />I can recommend this "movie" to movie makers as a educational film. If they changed the name to "Avoid Making Movies Like This". And also if you like to watch the worst of the worst, this "movie" is highly recommended!
