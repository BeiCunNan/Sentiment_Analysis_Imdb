Saying Bambi 2 is better than the original is a complete understatement. The film is perfect on every level of film making. It's an intoxicating feeling when a movie excites and enlivens us like this -- and there's a particular giddiness to be had in thinking about what movies can (but don't often) do for one's soul after imbibing such a fine vintage! Honestly, it is amazing. A must see film. Disturbing, brilliant, FANTASTIC! The film's screenplay is amazing, fantastic writing. Unpredictable. Seriously, didn't know what to expect next. The voice work, I consider, to be Oscar worthy acting! A complete masterpiece. 10/10.
