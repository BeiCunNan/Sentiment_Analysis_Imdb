I was, by any measure, a massive Prince fan in the 1980s. Owned every album and single, saw PURPLE RAIN too many times to count, saw Prince in concert a dozen times, etc...... That being said, UNDER THE CHERRY MOON is an unmitigated disaster. Horrible acting by Prince, poorly written dialog, and a meandering storyline are but a few of the reasons. And Prince's use of black and white is nothing more than novelty passed off as depth. No honest assessment could call this film entertaining. Jerome Benton was praised as Prince's comic foil but that was being generous - he comes off as a high school actor. Of course, some of the songs are beautiful but its not enough to save this pile of crap.
