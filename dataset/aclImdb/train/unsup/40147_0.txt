I had to register to make a comment on this terrible movie. this is more of a warning for other people!I saw it last week at the Rotterdam film-festival in Holland an paid Â€ 8,- for the ticket. A waste of money and a waste of time. I was in the middle of the row so I could not escape the terror. The story is difficult to follow, the acting is bad, the camera-work is uninspired. The only good thing is a scene where a artist makes a painting, and it's only worth anything if you like paintings... Unfortunately I cannot give any more positive reactions on this movie. If you ask me, it is probably the worst film I've ever seen.
