I'm a big fan of Disney movies. Aladdin is one of my favorites. When I watched Return Of Jafar I had several dislikes The First was How could Disney!!! Robin Williams Is the GENIE to change the character is just wrong. You wouldn't take a beloved character like pee wee Herman and change his voice to Billy Christal. Granted that Pee wee Herman is not a cartoon but its still its just wrong. Yes, Dan Castellaneta Does Excellent with Homer Simpsion in the Simpsions but hes no Robin William when it comes to the gene. I'ts just not the same. 2nd was that this movie is Probably one of the most poorly made Disney movie. When You watch certain parts the color is outside the lines. When Jaffar is the Big red ugly gene you can just see the color come off of him on certain parts. Another opinion of mine is that it seems like you just tried to get this movie done as quick as possible and you didn't care. I Always thought that maybe some guy in the studio might have said well this is a movie just for kids. Hurry up and get this done. They wont care. Well your wrong. We do care and kids are not that stupid. When a child watches a movie for the first time they get this glow and a twinkle in their eyes and they will remember it always. Everything from When and where they watched it, to how good it was, to who they watched it with and what other people thought. If they like the movie then they will tell their kids and it happens all over again. Disney is Family. Disney should take time and pride in their work. The only thing I liked about Return of Jafar is the plot and the music. I really with they could do a recall on this movie but keep in mind that this is just one girls opinion. So rent this movie and post a comment.
