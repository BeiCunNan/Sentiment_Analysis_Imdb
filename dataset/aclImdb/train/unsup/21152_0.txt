Cracking Up is one of my favorite movies.....OK, I might have a weird sense of humor... but the first time I saw it, I laughed so hard my side hurt. I bought the movie, and occasionally get it out and watch it again just to get a good laugh.<br /><br />several parts I like are the Restaurant scene, the waitress when she takes his order, it's hysterical. I'd love to do that to someone sometime.<br /><br />I also love the scene with the guru on the operating table, so funny.<br /><br />And the airplane scene..... "chef surprise....you'll love it" it makes me laugh just writing this.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, get your hands on a copy and watch it.
