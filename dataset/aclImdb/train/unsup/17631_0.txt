What an amazing film this is. It is possibly the only film I've ever seen which made me feel joyful, sad, angry, hopeful, and inspired all at the same time. I walked away from this film feeling great, and wondering what I can do to help. It is truly amazing to see how far we've come on this issue. I was in Boston while that was all happening, and I'm kicking myself now for not participating in any of the rallies. Now that I'm in LA, and when this happens here, I'll be sure to take part. This certainly will be a popular film in the gay community, and I certainly hope that it will reach out to those who need to see this to understand what we're fighting for.
