I was so afraid to watch this movie, because Bambi is one of my favorite cartoons ever, and I was afraid that this sequel will spoil it. But it always bugged me in Bambi, that in one scene his mother dies and his father takes him away, and then, in next scene Bambi is big and everybody is happy. I always felt like there's a part missing. And now, Bambi 2 filled that hole. When I watched it I was enchanted. Everything in this cartoon is so wonderful, nature, music... And the characters are so sweet. This movie have a really positive spirit, it can really cheer you up. It's really lovely. And it actually completes the old Bambi movie. I watched it several times. It's really great! It's really Disney!
