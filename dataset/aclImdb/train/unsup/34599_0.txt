I watched R&B because Robert De Niro was in it. But his "Are you talking to me?"-scene couldn't rescue this incredibly stupid movie. I really can't imagine how anyone could enjoy watching this horrible crap. I felt robbed after watching. This movie stole some time of my life. I watched the second half in fast forward, so i didn't had to stand this annoying moose.
