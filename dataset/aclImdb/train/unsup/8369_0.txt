From all the Don Knotts and Tim Conway films I've seen, this is by far my favorite. The brilliant chemistry between the actors is enough to keep the movie going, but it doesn't stop there. The plot itself, while admittedly spoofed, is intriguing, and I didn't expect the ending at all the first time I saw it. The fouled-up poems are always good for a laugh, not to mention the exceptionally well played "stoff," (not staff). The time-gun gag is priceless, and was undoubtedly an idea of Conway himself. From what I recall from an interview I saw with Don Knotts, he said this, and all others with Conway are personal favorites, because they were so "hard to produce." As he put it, it took probably three or four times as long to film as it should have because he and Conway couldn't stop improvising the script, and laughing, and so on. This is one film that I would love to see outtakes from. In all, a very good film with loads of laughs...some subtle, some in your face, but all-around a really good film.
