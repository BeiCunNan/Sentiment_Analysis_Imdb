"Bad Boys 2" takes all the personality, originality, creativity, and humor of "Bad Boys" and buries it in a disjointed mess of mindless, stupid, over wrought nonsense. This is such an awful mess I can't find the words to describe how bad it is. However, "abortion" and "clusterf**k" do come to mind. (D)
