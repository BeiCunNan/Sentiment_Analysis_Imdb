I saw this movie on the Amsterdam Fantastic Film Festival. and I loved it.<br /><br />To begin at the beginning, the characters of the film are very interesting for a horror movie, so is the setting. The fact that heather's parent's dropped her at a school for girls were the mistresses are strict and she gets taunted a lot are nice ways to build up the story.<br /><br />That's what's good about the movie, it builds up quite slowly (also because actually there is not much story to build up) and when we are fully aware of the threats, the viewer is also aware of the fact that one cannot escape from a mysterious force that is everywhere around you. Not even when Bruce Campbell is your dad.<br /><br />Bruce has a great part in this movie. Because its about a school for girls and 99.9% of the movie is filled with women (now I know why the director's name is Lucky) you can't expect Bruce to have a big part, however his part is vital towards the end of the movie. Lucky mcKay used Campbell in a great way and even makes him go into "evil dead" mode towards the end.<br /><br />Gore, blood and guts are not really what this movie is about. The scenes with the girls waving with axes are bloodstunning though. If you want to see a nice horror that is a bit different from the ordinary watch this! They should really release this baby. It won't be a box office smash hit but I think it'll definitely do something in the cinema, at least more than the 12 million it cost.
