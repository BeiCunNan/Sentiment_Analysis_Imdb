Lois and Clark put a different twist on the classic tale of the Man of Steel. Instead of focusing on the villains, the show mainly focused on the Superman-Lois-Clark triangle. The early seasons were very well done, with some great drama. However, once they got rid of John Shea, who did an excellent job as Lex Luthor, the show went downhill.<br /><br />To me, it got too campy. It started turning into the 1960's Batman series. The guest villains included Sherman Helmsley and Isabel Sanford aka the Jeffersons, Howie Mandel, Harry Anderson, Drew Carey and Kathy "Mimi Bobeck" Kinney, and the guy that played Mallory's boyfriend Nick on Family Ties. Not exactly striking fear in anyone is it? What kept the series going was the incredible sexual chemistry between Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher. They were perfect together. Many regard Hatcher as the best Lois Lane ever, and I'm inclined to agree. Though watch out for Erica Durance on Smallville.
