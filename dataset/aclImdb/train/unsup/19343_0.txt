So a plane crashes on a "Lost World" type of island. The plane broke in half in midair, so the survivors set off in search of the fuselage and the radio so they can call for help. Along the way they encounter giant spiders, man-eating vines, Pterodactyls, a rather odd (and entertaining) tribe of natives, and even King Kong.<br /><br />The special effects are pretty bad, especially King Kong, he's positively humorous. But this story is all about the characters, and it's pretty good in that area. Everyone plays it rather low key, you won't find your usual clich√©s nor your usual over-the-top imbeciles, but instead some folks that you can actually sort of care about and like. Their quest is also interesting, as they keep finding more and more planes that crashed on the island, which sets up a nice mystery, and then they're captured by the tribe of natives and we're pretty much in the B-movie fun zone after that.<br /><br />Overall, a surprisingly watchable low-budget effort. Good characters and interesting plot, and some really sexy and likable babes. I give it two thumbs up.
