The "stolen" material is pretty entertaining in how it is reused, and re framed by goofy narratives ("... anyway ...") - especially if you are familiar with - and a fan of - the source materials they are sampling. (Battletruck!!) And the President is none other than Godfather Roger Corman.<br /><br />Maybe a spoof, or maybe a tribute. Perhaps just a comedy. Whatever it was, it was SUPPOSED to be "bad!"<br /><br />Hmmm. It might be exactly made for the demographic that likes to do the Mystery Science Theater thing DIY, and sit around with friends and 'OMFG!' at how bad a movie can be. Hey wait, that's been me, too .... oh well. I reckon I'm OK with being a sucker for stuff like this. You could do a lot worse - and not much better. Even when it's not that funny, it's sure to be awesome.<br /><br />"F*** their classics, these are MY classics!" - Max Wasteland
