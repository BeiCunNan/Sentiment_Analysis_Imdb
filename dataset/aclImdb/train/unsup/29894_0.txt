I've seen hundreds, possibly thousands of movies. I sat through the abomination that was Tomb Raider 2. I watched the blindness producing Torque all the way through. But this.....this was just unwatchable.<br /><br />I love action/martial arts movies...who doesn't? But this is just awful. First it starts off with some exciting action, then degrades into a truly spectacular piece of crap, with a giant, a wizard, and a monkey man.<br /><br />Yes, I'm being serious.<br /><br />Once we met the wizard, I turned it off. No action in the world was good enough to make me keep watching.<br /><br />This movie had some truly awful acting, even for Thai movies this was bad. The action? boring, with one or 2 memorable scenes which I already saw on the trailer. The hero? only uses his knees. watching him kick the crap out of people the same exact way for 20 minutes gets boring...fast.<br /><br />Special effects? My god, they were bad...i mean we had the hero riding a rocket like a surfboard....Christ almighty can you believe that crap?! I feel stupider just having watched this movie, I urge you to save some brain cells and skip it. Watch Ong Bak, watch Tom Yum Goong, heck watch em twice, just don't watch this movie.<br /><br />-Inferno
