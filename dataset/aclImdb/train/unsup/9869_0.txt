Okay, I can certainly admit that the plot isn't original, and that things get predictable on more than a few occasions, but I still thought that this was a great movie. I tend to enjoy movies with truly hateful characters, and I thought that Jessica Lange played her part wonderfully. Paltrow and Foch also were effective in their roles. Yes, some scenes are melodramatic, and some are even hard to believe, but that's not always a bad thing. This type of movie is supposed to be a little over the top, after all. So, even though this movie takes us through some familiar territory, I still thought it was a lovely ride.
