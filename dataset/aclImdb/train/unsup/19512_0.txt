This is less a documentary than it is a work of art. Herzog presents a visual symphony comparable to the grandeur of Dante.<br /><br />The cinematography of this movie is a constant presence of beauty and terror, heart-throbbing and breathtaking, still always far from pathos. Inspiring and touching throughout its full length, Herzog demonstrates the power of pictures, the essence of film or photography as a medium separate from logical understanding. <br /><br />There is no storyline to this motion picture since it defines itself as such, - not as a visual derogative of verbal expression but as a free form of expression displayed in sensuous, demanding and touching PICTURES!<br /><br />This movie is a must for any photographer or person involved in visual arts, I have seldom encountered such a sincere and demanding work of cinematography.<br /><br />In a frenzy of subjectivity this flick deserves a full 10 out of 10, I am ready to die now, thank you...
