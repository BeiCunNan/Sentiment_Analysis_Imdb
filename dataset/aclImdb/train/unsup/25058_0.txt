I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It had many hilarious, lighthearted moments that had my eyes watering from laughter. The flip side is that while it made me laugh, it was also exploring some real issues about relationships and commitment and man's difficulties doing either! I enjoyed the sexy scenes but was pleasantly surprised to find that there is a lot more to this film than the box art suggests. Add to that some great acting and a couple of amazingly beautiful, sexy, hot, talented, (did I mention sexy) ladies, and you have a sure fire winner! I watched this film with my wife, and I can honestly say that there is something in this film for men and women alike (specially when you watch it together)Â…enjoy!
