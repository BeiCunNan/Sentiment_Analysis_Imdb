A group of filmmakers (College Students?) decide to make a documentary on how the most infamous serial killers of all time (Jason, Freddy, Michael, who all exist in the movie's universe) do what they do, so they meet up with one Leslie Vernon to see how he does his work. A Simple premise that takes off from the moment Leslie steps on the screen. The thing that makes this movie so entertaining is the fact that it dosn't take it self seriously in the slightest. Even the last quarter of the movie where it switches from documentary style to the standard stationary camera is very tongue in cheek. The way Leslie explains the little details and sleight of hands that are necessary to being a serial killer is very convincing and funny. He does it very enthusiastically and you actually believe that this is hat hes devoted his life too. He shows how all the "magic" that serial killers perceivably achieve, including walking when the victim is running("Cardio every day"), and the different terms ("Ahab" "Survivor Girl"). There are some shortcomings though. Robert Englund's Doc. Halloran feels like he was just added in for the star power, the slasher segment is lacking compared to the rest of the film. Overall, though this is a very entertaining mockumentary/slasher that is a must have for any slasher fan or any horror fan in general. Also watch the credits for a good usage of flame repellent gel.<br /><br />***1/2 out of *****
