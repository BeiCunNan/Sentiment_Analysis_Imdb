· Four young adults go on a road trip to document quirky roadside attractions and stumble across Captain Spaulding's Museum of Monsters and Madmen, which includes a murder ride indexing famous murderers· One of the attractions featured in the murder ride features a local Texas legend, Dr. Satan, who was accused of performing horrendous experiments on his patients at the Weeping Willows Mental Hospital·<br /><br />Captain Spaulding's horror ride piques the foursome's interest in Dr. Satan. Spaulding happily gives them directions to the tree where Dr. Satan was allegedly hanged by an angry mob. The four set out to investigate · Close to the hanging tree, and in the middle of a pouring storm, the four pick up a hitchhiker named Baby Firefly. Shortly after picking up Baby, their car blows a tire. In the middle of nowhere, with no spare tire, the four decide to take up Baby's offer to have her family help fix the car · Once the four have gathered at the decaying farmhouse inhabited by the Firefly family, the Halloween Eve fun begins <br /><br />· I'm a little ashamed to admit that this is one of my favorite horror movies, which is essentially a tribute to 70's horror films· People either really seem to love this movie or flat out hate it. I understand both perspectives. There are definitely some things I don't like, such as Zombie's choice to cast his wife Sheri (Not a professional actress) in the role of Baby Firefly, and the overuse of lighting effects in some scenes· Zombie doesn't hold back, and that's what I like about it. Zombie doesn't care if he steps on people's toes with this film. There is extreme graphic violence, much of which is committed against women· The editing and cinematography are cartoonish, and frightening at times. I was caught off guard when I viewed this movie for the first time, and was genuinely shocked and scared in some scenes. <br /><br />There are some quality jump scares and enough horror to go around for all· Some people seem to go into this movie having already decided their not going to be scared and their not going to like it because Zombie made it· Admittedly, I didn't like Zombie's attempt to remake Halloween. But House and the follow up, The Devil's Rejects will eventually come to be admired as quality horror film contributions **********Ten out of ten stars
