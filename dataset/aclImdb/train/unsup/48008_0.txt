I love David Hasselhof. When i sit at home at night watching his movies over and over again stroking the posters on my wall with every available part of my body, I can't help wondering how he repeatedly manages to associate himself with such energetic and creatively original scripts. I couldn't see the ending of this one coming at all! It definitely did NOT make me want to physically injure myself just so i could experience something worse than the sickly sweet clich√©d banality manifesting itself on screen!! I can sleep better at night knowing that if it weren't for the Hoff, modern cinema as we know it would be choking on its own creative vomit.
