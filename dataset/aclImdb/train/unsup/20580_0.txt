The Feeding was an interesting werewolf movie using the same effects from the howling with a little more fog to hide the wolf suit and continuity problems. Teenage campers and a forest ranger couple meet the wolf in the woods and fight for their lives. Some funny scenes and some good suspense, but nothing truly scary. Its set up like a B horror movie and it fulfills that niche very well. Most of the camera work was pretty dark, but it did the job. The acting left a lot to be desired, but not as bad as some B movies. Special effects were very rudimentary, but not too poorly done that they detract from the film. It is what it was meant to B.
