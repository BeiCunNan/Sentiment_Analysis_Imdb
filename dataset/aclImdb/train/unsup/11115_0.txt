I bought (yes! bought) this movie at my local store for the very low price of Â£3.99, so I wasn't expecting an oscar winner, but having seen this truly awful pile of crap, I think I deserve a refund. The acting was atrocious - among if not THE worst I have ever seen. I mean what was with the boss of the company who kept sticking green goo in his neck? he overacted something dreadfully the dialogue was apalling and the main actress Starr Andreeff (What a name!) was terrible, What action scenes there were - were lousy<br /><br />I have wasted 90 minutes of my life on this awful movie - I suggest you DON'T do the same!<br /><br />Rating 1/10
