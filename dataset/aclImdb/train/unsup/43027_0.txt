This last film in Chan-wook Park's trilogy is disappointing and boring. A woman framed for the murder of a child is released from jail and plots revenge on the man who framed her. This simple story is told in the most complicated, long-winded way by Park and is devoid of even rudimentary energy. The revenge sequence lacks credibility and proves that a dozen angry men and women with knives and axes are incapable of doing serious injury to a trussed up bad guy. Despite the director's sometimes evocative imagery, it seems to exist for its own sake, and does little to enrich the film's emotional wasteland. Yeong-ae Lee's vengeance-seeking protagonist is an inaccessible anchor for the film and is not particularly charismatic. Park's trademark explosions of mayhem lack bite. One small dream sequence pays homage to Alexander Jodorowsky, but it does not a flawed film save.
