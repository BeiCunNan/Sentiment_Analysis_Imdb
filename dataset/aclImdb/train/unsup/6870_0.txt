I just watched and enjoyed the movie 'wordplay' but was concerned about the lack of black people featured in the profiles of those who do puzzles.It seemed a bit all-clean-white (male) American to me, which spoiled the excellent story, great cinematography and music. Surely black people do the new York Times puzzle, although due to intrinsic economic and educational disadvantages they may not make the top 10 - this probably goes for women, too. (Its probably no coincidence that the top contenders were predominantly male). Yes, I did notice a few co loured people on the sidelines, but it would have been nice to have one as a feature. Better luck next time.
