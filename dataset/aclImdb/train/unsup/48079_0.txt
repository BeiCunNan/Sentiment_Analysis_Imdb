A movie that has three dogs dying in the first hour cannot be called a comedy. Whoever believes that's funny needs to get out of the advertising business or capitalism really is doomed. If I had thought this was a drama, I might have been prepared. Instead, I'm writing this review. "Terms of Endearment" was called a comedy, too. It's a shame that potentially good movies have to be billed as "comedies," setting audiences up to expect a good laugh. The only thing funny in this film were the overly-fake boobs of the blonde at Victoria's Secret. I don't believe in wearing fur, I do believe in rescuing animals, and in fact have been in every situation that was described in this film, so it's not like I don't have any experience with the subject matter. I have a rescue dog that bites me and I have no intention of having it euthanized. Billing euthanasia as comedy relief is either an attempt to exploit the animals the film portrays or it's a product of a sick, twisted culture that has reached the bottom of the barrel for something funny. I'm ready to say bring back the Keystone Cops if this is the best Hollywood can do for funny -- cause this ain't. Make any kind of film you want -- just don't label it as funny when it isn't.
