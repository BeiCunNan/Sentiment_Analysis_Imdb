Following hot on the tails of the monumental success of the first TV film, Highschool Musical 2 manages to out do itself in the newest sequel of the soon to be long franchise of films to come. Part two finds the entire cast of Part one ready to celebrate the summer, when (with the help and dastardly doings of evil sharpay) the entire school manages to end up working at a posh resort. The formula is still the same: simple plot, swooning girls, and boys with squeaky clean images. This time though the quality of the music has been stepped up a notch, with a more conscious effort to write more theatrical music (with the exception of a few silly fillers). The cast is still strong with Efron and Hudgens leading the pack. Corbin Bleu is a standout actor and gets to show off his potential, and Ashley Tisdale commands the screen with her quirky off beat character. Of course there are the lines that are so cheesy that you laugh out loud, and of course the awkward moments (Efron's "angry" dance number comes to mind) but it's still entertaining. The real star though is Kenny Ortega who helms the project and brings some exceptional choreography and ideas to the small screen. Bravo!
