This film was terrible to be honest. No acting, no story, just a cop-out of the first one. Everyone is commenting on Bree Turner's portrayal of the "bitch" being great and the best .. it's not actually? I'm from the U.K and maybe shes not a familiar face over here but I cant think of anything else she's been in. She tried too hard to be the "bitch" and gives a mediocre performance? The cheering was o.k in this one, but nothing special. On the back of the D.V.D cover (yes! i didn't know i wouldn't like it!) it says something like "with a group of rising, up-and-coming new stars" .. what stars? They haven't been in anything since. I can ONLY vaguely remember watching Faune Chambers in "Epic Movie" which was also a flop in my eyes? The acting is shocking! I LOVE the Bring It On series and I actually do prefer the straight-to-DVD films rather than the original (my opinion!), i like the first one, and I LOVE bring it on 3 & 4 .. but this one? - - NOT WORTH A PLACE IN MY FAVES.
