I don't remember Serbian film that I utterly enjoyed like this one in years. If I remember correctly last I liked like this one was Kusturica's Underground. Film is dealing with serious things, but in light and funny fashion.<br /><br />And I know lot of people from Belgrade who really act like these characters in film. For example I know few doctors that using cocaine. Policemen are really behaving like those in movie. Belgrade is thorn apart by war and neglected and lot of people still isn't recovered from Milosevic's regime.<br /><br />Apart from political aspects, film is really great. It seems to me that author tried to underline that accidents are just tools of fate. It is something that comes from eastern religions or philosophies (Orthodox Christianity, Islam etc).
