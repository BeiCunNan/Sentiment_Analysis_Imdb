I cannot believe I am writing a review for this stinking piece of garbage... Why! Why would anyone write, produce, direct, act in, or just be associated with such an abomination...<br /><br />This movie is supposed to be a sequel to awful but well-known movie known as "Turkish Star Wars". That movie was the second worst thing happened to Turkish image after 'Midnight Express'. This one is a close third. The original movie was made by unexperienced youngsters with misguided idealism and without money. This one must be written by a thousand retarded monkeys on crack.<br /><br />There is no decent plot, or script, or anything that makes sense. The direction is bad, acting is ridiculous, editing is awful. There is really nothing to say about it. <br /><br />This movie is so bad, I felt insulted. Never see it... Never.
