This movie exemplifies the best features of bad sci fi. It starts out really bad. I mean *really* *really* bad. But where other bad sci fi movies fail, ROTOR succeeds... because IT GETS WORSE. If you graphed it, the stupidity of this movie would move up and to the right as it runs its course. That is amazing.
