Ringo Lam's 'Victim' is a movie that it's difficult to talk about without giving away too much, but I'll try. A thriller with supernatural undertones and a particularly intriguing plot, it certainly stands out from the main body of his work - there are action scenes, and they're well handled, but this is much more of a character-led mystery.<br /><br />After a pointless killing in a car park, the police discover that their prime suspect is actually a victim, abducted by brutal kidnappers. But why would anyone kidnap an unemployed man with heavy debts? When he's returned without a ransom, dumped in a supposedly haunted hotel that was the site of a brutal murder, things get weirder still as he seems to have developed an entirely different personality. Is it post-traumatic stress or is he possessed by a murderer's ghost - or is it something completely different? Like most mysteries, once the cat is out of the bag it loses much of its grip, although the explanation is quite satisfying. But for the most part it's a beautifully crafted with several standout sequences and some surprisingly strong performances.
