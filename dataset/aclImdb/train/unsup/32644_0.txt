I'm brown, British, loved Van Wilder and Kal Pen but this film is utter sh*t.<br /><br />Unfunny, unimaginative, badly directed and written.<br /><br />As an initial idea it's great (that's why I went out of my way to see it) but the execution is nothing but shockingly poor.<br /><br />The acting is poorly directed whist I have to say I expected worse from the accents (remember those terrible British accents by the "diarrhoea twins" in Harold and Kumar? <br /><br />The dialogue was just offensive and I don't mean in a racial term (see above - I'm brown.) just p*ss Poor. Even Kal Penn's Hindi comments were just offensive and unfunny.<br /><br />I wonder if this is an example of one of those projects producers and studio execs use as a vehicles to get laid?
