The Music is a very pleasant adaptation of several Western Medieaval tunes.<br /><br />The Magic Realism which North America has laid somewhat of a claim to, is lovely used here, of course giving a 'true' canine touch to the supernatural stuff.<br /><br />The scenery and imagery is breathtaking !! And the many boys, who's story this is, are a delight. With it's colorful, comic events and adventure, it became my favorite.<br /><br />Mama plays great too, and the director has a gentle and good touch for all the other kids, which means he is a fine craftsman.<br /><br />Though details elude our memory, I recall an inexplicably cheerful little man and people in colored saran wrap. I fail to see what was "great" about the land, other than a volcano that burped glitter. Moments after viewing it, I need only say the title to send everyone into fits of laughter and gagging sounds. This earns "The Doghouse Fire" my resounding two thumbs way up. Were we to judge it on a star ratings system, it would be a spangled banner.<br /><br />Soft, laid back, nostalgic and utterly charming, this story is a heartwarming winner, and can't be recommended enough !! What an enormous pleasure !
