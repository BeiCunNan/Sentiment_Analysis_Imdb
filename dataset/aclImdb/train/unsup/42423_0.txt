Büyü ("Magic" in English but the meaning is more associated with black magic) was filmed in a small village in Turkey with a handful of actors/actresses, it does not make much use of CG; so, to sum up this is a low-budget movie. It has a lot of problems; first of all, the scenario is not original and is slow-pacing. Dialogs are very straightforward and unsuccessful; this is one of the biggest problems about the movie in my opinion. In many aspects, the movie may be termed as a "plain" movie. This fact added with the problems above makes it uninteresting. It is termed as a horror movie here in Turkey, but in today's standards it is not scary at all. Watch it if you are curious about how a Turkish horror/thriller movie would be; else don't even bother...
