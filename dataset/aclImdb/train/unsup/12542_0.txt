This film was tailor made for the Ailurophobe: if you believe that cats have a hidden agenda and possibly even a secret plan to take over the world then you really cannot miss this movie.<br /><br />One of the worst insults hurled at one of the main characters is `Dog lover.' <br /><br />There are quite a few chuckles and some real laugh-out-loud jokes but primarily this is one sight gag after another.<br /><br />Sean Hayes (Will and Grace, Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss) is great as the nefarious `Mr. Tinkles,' the leader of the underground cat society, whose biggest threat is the maid of the house in which he resides.<br /><br />Susan Sarandon and Jon Lovitz turned in their usual great performances as the voices of Ivy' and Calico,' respectively.<br /><br />Jeff Goldblum makes a great nerd. Compare him to his sexy persona in `Earth Girls Are Easy' and many of his other films and you can see what a multi-dimensional actor he really is.<br /><br />The sound track by John Debney is perfect  shades of John Williams without being overbearing or detracting from the action on the screen.<br /><br />While this is primarily a kid's movie there are some adult jokes: the word play on the substance being manufactured by Mr. Tinkles owner, as an example.<br /><br />This is good summer escapist fare  especially if the theater is air-conditioned and you are not looking for great art. It is entertaining, mindless and a lot of fun.
