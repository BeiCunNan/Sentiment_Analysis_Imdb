and that word is, Retarded. Comedy Inc. is a show that calls itself a comedy, but simply does not make people laugh. It has a totally lame cast, with Roman Danylo constantly over-acting his parts, and making up REALLY stupid characters for which to do his sketches. The girls on the show, quite frankly, have no comedic talent. They are just horrible at impressions, for those of you who have seen the judge Judy skit, you know what I'm talking about. Also, it is a Canadian show, so why do they try and tackle so many American issues? Americans do not want to see a bunch of no talent Canadians making American jokes, just as Canadians don't want to see a bunch of slack jawed Americans making Canadian jokes. It just doesn't flow. Anybody thinking of watching this show, you might as well take a fork and jab yourself in the eye, that would be a lot more entertaining then watching this dreg. Bottom line: over acting, bad impressions, lame skit ideas, terrible show.
