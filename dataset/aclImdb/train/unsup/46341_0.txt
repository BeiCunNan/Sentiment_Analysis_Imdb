Well, my journey down the 'video nasty' road has brought me to a little-known gem called "Axe." My buddy loaned it to me and I checked it out with great expectations. I'd heard lots about this movie and how gritty it was. I have to say, I am not too impressed.<br /><br />I like the mediocre acting, the cheesy plot, and the music, but there just wasn't enough violence and blood in this film for me. You never actually see someone get hacked up. It's one of those 'camera cuts away just before' movies. The plot was pretty much a run of the mill "Last House on the Left" ripoff. Sadistic lunatics torture a family. Big deal.<br /><br />Even for the low budget, "Axe" should have been better. I mean come on...how expensive is fake blood? 4 out of 10, kids.
