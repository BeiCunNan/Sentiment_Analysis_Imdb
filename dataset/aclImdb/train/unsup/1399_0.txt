More poo than Poe, this tiresome horror sees scaredy cat Bela Lugosi arrive at the home of his old enemy Boris Karloff with smug honeymooners David Manners and Julie Bishop. There's some fun in seeing Frankenstein and Dracula duff each other up, I suppose, but other than that there's little to hold the attention. Nothing much happens, and the 70 minute running time seems twice as long. Lamest of all is the film's dubious morality: no one blinks an eye when an otherwise likable Lugosi knifes a cat; and the ending sees Manners and Bishop enjoying one of those it's-all-over-now, ho-ho epilogues after they've accidentally shot Lugosi in the back and made a run for it while everyone else explodes. It's all very tiresome.
