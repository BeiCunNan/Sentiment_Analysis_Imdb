There's no escaping it: "Slumber Party Massacre 3" is terrible. The acting is so bad that you'll cringe, and the undercurrent of this film is more serious that the second one that had to be respected for charting its own course. How odd is this film? Well let's put it this way: the film bills one guy "wierdo," however very clearly there are two of those.<br /><br />Okay, so the plot: some friends decide to have a Slumber Party, and only one girl gets to invite a guy. The other guys crash the party, and of course as happens, one by one the girls and their boyfriends are whittled down.<br /><br />For some reason, the killer dons a mask to kill the first couple, but then shuns it to kill most. Of course, there's no connection to the first two- why the killer chooses to use a drill when a knife, a machete, a gun, or any number of other things would make more sense. I guess however if the killer isn't using a drill, it can't be a "Slumber Party Massacre" film.<br /><br />On a related note, the quality of acting is so obviously varied- two or three of the actors are decent, and the rest are strictly chosen based on their cute-ness! I'd tell you more about the film, but I can't. It follows no logical projection or anything. Its total cheese, although its not meaning to be.
