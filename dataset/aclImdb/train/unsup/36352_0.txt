The "hero" of this movie has no redeeming qualities! Though bent on revenge, he has to crybaby breakdowns, then becomes "tough" shoveling dirt on a highway construction job (those guys don't look tough to me) and then comes up with a crazy plan to bury the bad guy in a hole in the highway. Luckily for him, no cars come by after the initial three that appear right after Dolan's Cadillac is driven into the hole. The hero then tries to bury the car with one load of dirt, that he shovels in by hand, rather than using the front loader that he has available. An effort is made to make him appear to be "crazed" but all the movie does is make him look stupid. Slater on the other hand plays the same character he played in "Pursued". It is unlikely that anyone of Oriental heritage will enjoy the racist crap he has to say about them. Nothing here for those who like good movies, or even those that can accept so-so movies...
