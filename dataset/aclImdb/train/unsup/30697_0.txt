I have seen this movie and I don't think anyone else who has would disagree that it is the worst movie ever made. I swear that I could make a better movie with a couple of friends and a camcorder. It's supposed to be about how some Vietnam vet had problems after coming home from war and how he was using "the vicious combat techniques of raw power and heroic behaviour he learned in Vietnam to stand up to the street scum" of New York. That is quoted from the back of the movie case - in actuality, the heroics he learned in Vietnam included shooting a Vietnamese woman, and then dropping his gun and running from other Vietnamese with sticks. In New York, he has a wife and a child that is supposed to be a product of napalm I suppose. The thing looks like E.T. - it's ridiculous. Anyway, my friends and I watch this movie and we enjoy laughing our asses off at it. Maybe you will too.
