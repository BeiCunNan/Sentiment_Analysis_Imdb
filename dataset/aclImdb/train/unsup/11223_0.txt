`Asoka' is a story of love and war. In the end love conquers all, no pun intended. I would say it's one-third `Gladiator', one-third `The Patriot' and the rest is a typical love story that comes with Hindi films; boy meets girl.. et al. The scenes were edge of your seat suspense, guessing and enthusiastically awaiting the next. The music was different, not too much song and dance but it was very soulful music that related to the story. Kareena's performance was outstanding. Her role was powerful, I don't think just about anyone could've done it; she carried it out well. She definitely earned her spot as one of the best in Bollywood. As always, ShahRukh was remarkable. He played an aggressively barbaric and cold-hearted warrior but underneath his heavy armor and seriousness, you'll find that same charismatic ShahRukh that wooed us in "KKHH". All in all, I recommend `Asoka' to anyone who's looking for something different. It has everything, action, heart and a little humor. I will warn you that it gets nauseously graphic with body parts flying allover. Viewer discretion is advised.
