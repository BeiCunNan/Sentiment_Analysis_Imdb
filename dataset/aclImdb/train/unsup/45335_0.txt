As an avid fan of Zombie movies I checked out this one after reading the positive comments on the box. Was I in for a disappointment.<br /><br />The movie exist of 3 diaries of people who come in contact with a zombie infestation (newsgroup, young couple who escaped and group of survivors on a farm) that the director tries to connect in some obscure way and filmed in a Blair Witch kinda first person angle.<br /><br />The first "diary" makes sense (a newsgroup) and is a way to do a movie I can appreciate (Diary of the dead, ReC), but it absolutely made no sense that the guy accompanying the young couple and one of the survivors are filming (to the absurd in the case of the guy with the couple). The director also doesn't give any reason why they would do so. The movie would have worked a whole lot better if these 2 diaries would have been filmed in a normal way.<br /><br />The introduction/idea of a sociopath/psychopath on the human side of a zombie film (Goke) has merits, but isn't worked out sufficiently enough and the last 15 minutes are a complete mess that raises a lot of questions (what happened to Manny, why and how did Goke end up with the survivors, how and why did Leean end up in that barn (well Goke obviously, but would it have been so hard to let her say her name to the soldier to make it a bit more clear ???)<br /><br />PS. Don't get me started on the make up and special effects because the average Goth in the street looks scarier than what this director let loose on the world (and that's taking into account the first person camera and the darkness)<br /><br />In short, I don't really understand why some critics can be so positive about this movie and the current score between 4 and 5 seems about right<br /><br />other titles I recommend: Diary of the dead, Rec, 28 days later (for the English angle)
