Ever want to know how those supposed family feuds happen, when two groups end up killing each other on site? Stories of these age-old battles have been curiously explored in literature such as Huckleberry Fin which tackles the subject with daring accuracy. This is the first film to show us not only a convincing portrayal of one of these family feuds, but showing us how they start; often by human beings who are hot-headed and overly defensive, potential bad-seeds which can take the whole family down with them, and in a poor society that allows such aggression to ferment and be propelled forward onto another family. I think it is important to note that there are no real villains in this film, only people offended and wanting satisfaction for their own grief.<br /><br />Now to judge it more as a physical film, the lead actor is terrific and captivates us throughout the entire film. The other actors give solid performances but not stand-out ones. The sound design is masterful, and much needed for there is a lot of silence, and not a lot of dialogue, yet the sound design keeps us on edge whenever we need to be. Direction is fine, and the writer/director obviously knows where to pull his punches without overdoing it (so he doesn't labour his points and thus overall message of the film).<br /><br />I don't agree with the soundtrack, and I think it takes away from the film a little. A few too many sequences of beautiful cinematography with music goes a little longer than necessary, but this is nitpicking and overall an excellent and original film.
