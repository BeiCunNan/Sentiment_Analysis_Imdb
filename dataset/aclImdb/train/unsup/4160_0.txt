Allegedly the only sex film (actually, there is nudity but no sex- on the part of the humans, anyway) ever made with live humans AND puppets. With a classic smut director at the helm, more weirdness than even Meet The Feebles and TWO cast members from Blood Sucking Freaks- how can you lose?? Well, OK, actually it sucks, but you know you still have to have it- if you can get it!
