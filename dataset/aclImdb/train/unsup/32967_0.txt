I hate those movie reviews that really hang it heavy on the movie in question, but after just spending the last 100 minutes of my life watching The Legend of Lucy Keyes, I can't help but think I've been seriously ripped off and am about to do some serious hanging! <br /><br />Compared on the DVD cover to the magnificent Nicole Kidman flick "The Others", The Legend of Lucy Keyes is nothing but a poor B grade movie that's borrowed a little bit from this film and a little bit from that film - see the barn in "The Ring" and the Indians in "The Missing".<br /><br />The special effects in "Lucy" are appalling. Seriously, Ghost Busters has better special effects in comparison to today's standards which should have made the spook in "Lucy" much more believable. And what's with all the open windows - it's late autumn in this movie and bedroom windows are left open just a little to add to the supposed mood with flowing curtains and blowing tree branches.<br /><br />But the big questions is this - what on earth is Julie Delpy (Before Sunset) doing in a movie like this? After the 2004 mini series remake of Frankenstein she should have known better than to sign on for this one! The Legend of Lucy Keyes may very well be just the thing for some movie goers, and good luck to 'em. To each their own. But after a very brief promising few minutes at the start, for me, this movie just became more and more predictable and ridiculous.
