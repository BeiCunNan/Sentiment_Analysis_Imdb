I must have seen this movie more then a hundred times, know every lines. Putting aside the fact that this movie made me Miss Peter's biggest fan. While watching this movie in France (over and over again), it gave me the urge, need, inspiration to move to the Big Apple, and pursue my dreams. Combining it with Working Girls, Hannah and her Sisters, and Bare Foot in the Park, I put this movie to portrait New York at its best and truest, as I want to see it, as it supposed to be, as I am seeing it. Whenever in doubt with the city watching the movie all over again reminds me of what New Yorkers are all about of the reason I moved here, and regain my faith in New York! One of the top movies ever made, one of the best New York movie, with some of the best actresses (lets face it, top stage actors ARE the top screen actors as well). Let's not forget to mention Miss Mercedes Ruehl, whom actually rules!!!<br /><br />"- My only problem is that I can't sew. But a lot of people can't sew......

I never knew anybody with a whole house"<br /><br />"-OOOOh, where did you get that Ice cream? -From the freezer!"<br /><br />THANK YOU
