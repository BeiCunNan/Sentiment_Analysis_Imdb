That' right, a bloody soap opera, what the hell were they thinking? Let's do the check list of what they did right with this Galactica remake, I can count that on one hand. Better effects and cooler Cylons. That's it! What's with this Politically Correct B.S.? I'm all for having female pilots. But why make major changes on key characters, I mean Adama was Spanish, Starbuck wasn't a woman and Boomer was a African American Male, not a Asian American Female. That's one, two killing off Boomer for a Cylon replacement. Then she falls for a human and has a baby, how much of soap opera do you call that? Next, the Cylons were created by a race of alien reptiles which they turned on and made extinct. Like they want to do to us. Did want to be too sci-fi-ish? Did they watch the original show, it was a science fiction. It's suppose to be a science fiction! Now let's talk about the bullets. Lasers are sci-fi anymore, they actually exist! Plus, it's not sci-fi about laser battles in space, it's science fact that a bullet would not work in a area of non-gravity, like SPACE! So, having a space battle with bullets makes no sense what so ever. If you got hooked on this crapper then stop watching it. Go cold turkey and realize that the show is a turkey. I give it...THE NOOSE!
