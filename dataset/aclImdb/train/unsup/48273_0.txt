The lead female's (Alice) son had at some point in the past been horribly murdered whilst on the way home. Alice's family blamed her for the entire tragedy and Alice had gone mad with guilt because she blamed herself.<br /><br />As she couldn't believe anyone could such a horrible crime to a child she invented an inhuman monster (a clown) as the perpetrator. Most of the film is a strange fantasy as I think she's never supposed to leave the mental institution where she's locked up. Also Darren Day wanders around symbolising Alice's alter ego, A strong version of herself who can do what she could not and fight off the monster that murdered her son.<br /><br />This may or may not be the plot of the film, to be quite honest within 5 minutes of the film starting you will desperately want to turn it off. I guarantee you will not care one bit.<br /><br />This is an art horror film with very little script and it's clear the actors are struggling with the few awful lines they do have. The film instead relies on symbolism to push the story forward. This doesn't work at all and leaves the audience very very confused. The film itself has all the hallmarks of a film that has been heavily altered and scenes/characters removed, I cannot believe that anyone would fund a 90 minute film on 10 pages of dire dialogue. I also refuse to believe anyone would knowingly make anything so bad.<br /><br />The only good point about the entire thing is that the lead actress is quite attractive. But that in itself is no reason to watch.
