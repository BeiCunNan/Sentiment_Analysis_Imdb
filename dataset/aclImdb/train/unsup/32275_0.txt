Not many movies made such a good use of stereotypes and urban myths of former Yugoslav Army. Two older guys in the story, Ljuba and Sinisa, are smarter than the rest of the lot, supposedly 19-years old conscripts (one is educated, the other is street-smart sociopath). Ubiquitous sound of so called folk music and appalling rudeness in communication are also contributing to making this movie the closest thing to actually being there. And strangely enough, not hating it.<br /><br />It is a bit unfortunate that Grlic, with his incredible sense for funny and bizarre, hadn't had a chance to make more films in the past.<br /><br />Still, this one almost makes up for years of his absence from the scene.
