You'll probably never find this one at your local video store, or even a major one. But if youre in the mood for noir, horror, mystery, and tastefully done, if not graphic, erotica, hunt this one done! The movie starts out with a injured detective, and a mother/daughter burying there driver in a ditch, which they killed. Then, after some weird dialog/interactions between the mother and daughter, the wounded detective shows up at their door. Then it takes off from there, electro therapy (although its not used as its suppose to be) golden showers, perfect and a little weird dialog, threesomes, and some nasty violence/masochism. Although I would watch out, there are some copies of the movie in which the subs are fuzzy.
