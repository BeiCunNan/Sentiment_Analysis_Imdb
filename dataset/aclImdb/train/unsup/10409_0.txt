This is a movie with atmosphere & spirit! 'Predator' is a modern classic and it might be one the best action-movies ever. Seldom you have the possibility to experience such well done atmosphere, filled with suspense. 'Predator' is rough, ruthless and brutal. Kevin Peter Hall steals the show as a dangerous and powerful menace. The special effects are also well made. The most powerful scene in 'Predator' is when Bill Duke together with the rest of the group stands in the forest shooting wildly all around the trees without knowing what they really are doing there! <br /><br />'Predator' is similar to 'Hell in the Pacific' in it's motives with the same claustrophobia, and it has a discussion about the macho-ideal, which few seems to notice.<br /><br />Rating: 10 of 10.
