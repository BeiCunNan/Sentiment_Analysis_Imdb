My wife and I had our first Sundance Cinema experience this week with a showing of Die Grosse Stille. The theater (brand new) is equipped with unbelievably comfortable chairs (not seats) that support the body with wonderful and relaxing ease. The film was, undoubtedly, our finest cinema experience ever. The almost three hour running time seem to slip by totally unnoticed as we were immersed in the lives of the Carthusian monks. Unfortunately for movie attendees in Madison (WI), this film played only one week and was gone. At our showing there were 12 persons in the theater; all were completely quiet and no outside sounds were heard. The best atmosphere to view this film. It was simply superb...all aspects of the monastery life were there for us to share. We will eagerly look forward to the DVD (US version) when it comes out later this year. Definitely not a movie for everyone but for those in the right frame of mind, a must see!!
