This film really was pretty awful; some of the characters made me cringe! very poor acting, directing, etc., Could learn a thing or two from the 'Carry on' films. It was no better than any of the other 'Confessions'films; I only watched it to the end to read the credits - there were some well known faces; what happened to the little boy actor, I wonder. Was his name Robert Booth? I noticed that the Railway station had 'Hayling' on it; perhaps it was Hayling Island? Does anyone know which camp it was filmed at? I used to go to Coronation and Sunshine on the Island; those were the days! I wonder if PM watched his father-in-law! The likeness is quite uncanny. Yuk!!!
