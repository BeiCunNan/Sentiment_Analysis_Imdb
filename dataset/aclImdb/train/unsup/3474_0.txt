In reading some of the other comments on this movie people are talking about plot holes, bad accents, and lack of direction. To those who feel that way shame on you. If we were talking about The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption, Or even Lord of The Rings those types of comments and thoughts would be justified, not that I feel that way about any of those movies, but not for a movie like Reign Of Fire. Some movies are made to be thought about and others to just watch and have fun. Reign Of Fire is one of the ones to just watch and have fun. Does it deserve any awards, no. Does it take itself to seriously, no. Can you watch it and just enjoy the special effects, sound, and premise, yes. So the bottom line go to Blockbuster, rent it, sit down and don't think just watch and you will have an enjoyable 90 minutes.
