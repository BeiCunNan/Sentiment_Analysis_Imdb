I saw this movie at a festival, and was completely struck by it. The characters were written so artfully that it quickly became my favorite film there. I kept expecting I'd hear about a theatrical release at some point.<br /><br />Unfortunately for this movie, on paper it probably seems like another Gen X bitch-fest. But in actuality, it is a really eye opening look at human issues NOT related to a specific generation. Groping for success, love and happiness is a basic human action, no matter how old you are. And the characters that populate this film want for the full range of human desires. Sometimes it's heavy, but usually it's funny.<br /><br />The writer/director of this film has eerie insight into how people work (especially with the female character). He's surely going to go far.
