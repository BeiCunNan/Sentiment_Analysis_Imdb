I tend to favor your typical bubble-gum pop and classic movies and had very little interest in INDI films. Those that I HAVE seen were either blatant political propaganda disguised as "art" or had such a narrowly focused target audience that I didn't empathize with the main characters.<br /><br />This film, however shatters all those preconceived notions! The plight of a romantic man in this day and age is so perfectly laid out in this short foray into irony. I just wish it was available to purchase! I have a number of friends and family members who would get a kick out of the irony, the dry humor, the only-slightly-overplayed stereotyped characters. You're not a fly on the wall in a real scenario, but so very close that it forces you to ask questions of yourself.<br /><br />This is an exemplary piece of film, and if you get the chance to catch it DO! If you have plans, then set your TIVO... it is completely worth it!
