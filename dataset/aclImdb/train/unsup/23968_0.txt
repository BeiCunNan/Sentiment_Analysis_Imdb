This is one of my favourite martial arts action films. It's a fun, entertaining buddy/road movie that is guaranteed to leave a smile on your face. It also showcases Mark Dacascos perfectly. Far too many of his films fail to capture his grace and athleticism, not Drive. Kadeem Hardison is a also a great talent. I hate making comparisons, but this came out before Rush Hour and is funnier, more emotionally involving, and sorry Jackie, but the kung fu is streets ahead.<br /><br />If you get the DVD, play the hilarious audio commentary, featuring director, fight choreographer and the two stars. It really sounds like four guys on a sofa talking trivia about a favourite movie, and it's great. It's also amazing to learn that some of the best lines and coolest moves were ad-libbed, or choreographed without a wire.
