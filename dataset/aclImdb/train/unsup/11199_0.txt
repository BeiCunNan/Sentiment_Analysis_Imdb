Juliette Binoche gives a riveting performance as Madame La, the wife of a Captain of the guard on a small French-owned island(Saint Pierre)off the coast of Newfoundland. When a man (Emir Kusturica) is found guilty of a senseless murder and sentenced to death, the execution is postponed until a guillotine can be sent for. Meanwhile Madame La becomes interested in his fate, hoping for his rehabilitation. Daniel Auteuil gives another brilliant performance as her devoted husband. Well acted and beautifully filmed, the film is a pleasure to watch.
