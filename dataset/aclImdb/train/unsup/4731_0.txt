my girlfriend and I loved it. we found it very funny. my girlfriend and I were able to relate with a lot of the situations. there were moments when I was doubling over in my seat laughing.<br /><br />Kate Hudson is great, aside from being really pretty. :) she has a good knack for comedy. all throughout the movie we saw shades of her mom's (Goldie Hawn) style, but with enough touches of her own to make her own style distinct. <br /><br />of course, the movie is predictable, particularly the ending, which I felt needed a little more polish. but all in all, it was very enjoyable.
