Noah Baumbach is known for his assistance in the writing of great films such as The Life Aquatic and the Royal Tennenbaums along with Wes Anderson. This film holds place in the hall of fame of black comedy films with what seems to be a highly strange plot which in fact is quite common: the story of a couple living in Brooklyn with two sons going through the beginning of their separation. From the very start of the film you begin to see how Walt teams up with his father, played by Jeff Daniels, whilst young Frank (Pickle) shares his opinions of the separation with his mother. Bill Murrey was the original choice for the role of Bernard Berkman, yet Jeff Daniels still manages to play the role perfectly with highly comedic one liners. In the film both Walt and Frank grow through new and difficult stages in their lives, Walt is discovering his sexuality by not only showing interest in his new girlfriend but also his father's college student; and Frank, a new teenager also suffers from hormonal and sexual issues, not to mention his seamen distribution throughout his school, his new interest in beer, hilarious vulgar outbursts, and his non-artistic role-model Ivan the tennis coach. The title reveals itself at the end when Walt runs to the museum to see the large representation of a Squid and a Whale with Lou Reed's monotonous voice in the background giving the film a polished ending. I highly recommend this film to those of you who share the same passion for dark humor and great cinematography.
