Richard Harrison returns once again (albeit unwittingly if you know the history behind these films) as a ninja master yet again named Gordon (but ostensibly not the same character in each film)<br /><br />At the inception of the movie we see Gordon training a young student named Billy in the ancient warrior art and explaining to him it's historical origins. The film then inexplicably jumps forward in time some years to when Billy is grown up (and strangely sporting an Australian accent!) and has returned to his native home (The Phillipines?) where he manages to get on the wrong side of a gang of heavies and their vicious boss who are extorting money from the villagers amongst other criminal activities.<br /><br />If you're familiar with the 'Cut and Paste' 'Masterpieces' synonymous with the names of director Godfrey Ho and producer Joseph Lai then you'll know exactly what to expect here.<br /><br />The segments showing the 'grown up' Billy in this film are in fact footage taken from a completely separate film with the newer footage of Harrison's character and the other ninjas spliced into it at irregular intervals.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the 'plot' at hand....<br /><br />Whilst Billy is experiencing problems involving the gangsters, Gordon is having some trouble of his own in the form of an evil Ninja calling himself Ivan the Red (Dave Wheeler) whose aim is to challenge Gordon to combat in order to prove his fighting supremacy and to wrest the supreme 'ninja power' from him. When Gordon initially refuses to participate in any such confrontation Ivan resorts to challenging and subsequently killing other ninja in order to goad Gordon into battle.<br /><br />Having dispatched of each opponent Ivan removes their (rather crappy) Ninja headbands which he then sends to Gordon as proof of his kill (although I've seen exactly the same crappy Ninja Headbands for sale for about Â£2.00 in martial arts shops so he might as well have bought a few from there and saved himself some hassle)<br /><br />Finally Gordon is forced to accept the challenge to stop the bloodshed (although as per usual with these films despite ninja being sliced/stabbed etc there is not one drop of the red stuff in sight!!!) I'm sure that you can guess the final outcome. <br /><br />What can I say about this film?<br /><br />Well the acting/dubbing is atrocious and to call the link between the ninja footage and the footage involving the character of Billy as tenuous would be overly complimentary (it's completely none existent!)....so in other words it's all brilliant fun! <br /><br />If (like me) you are into bad movies then you'll no doubt be able to derive a good laugh from this one.<br /><br />The fight scenes are especially energetic here with lot's of flips and acrobatics and oh, did I mention that our hero wears a pink ninja uniform? Hmmmm intriguing indeed.....
