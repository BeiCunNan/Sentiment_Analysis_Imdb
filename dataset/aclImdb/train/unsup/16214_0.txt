Starwars mockumentaries are as abundant as they are poorly made, unfortunately. Saving Star Wars is no exception. Sandwiched between lack luster cinematography is a meandering plot, amateur acting and just plain goofy dialog (even for a Starwars knockoff). This film is a text book case of a producer with money throwing it at a group of amateurs to make a film. The byproduct is not funny, cannot be taken seriously (even when it wants to) and is not entertaining even to the most rabid Starwars fan (like myself). The film fails technically as well, with poor editing and poor camera work resulting in many out of focus shots, seamed panning and lots of camera bounce. It looks like most of the work was done with a Canon XL-1 or possibly mended together with GL-1 shots as well. Scenes inside the convention center were cast in the dreaded "green" from fluorescent lights, further evidence of poor camera work and lack of gel use. No true "tone" of the film was ever established or maintained.<br /><br />The occasional bright spots were performances by Jim Peterson as Hank, who becomes more annoying than funny over time, George Starkey as George Lucas, who bears a striking resemblance to Lucas, a confident Lee Ann Millen as Lisa (Princess Lea/Padme) who combined slightly odd/cuteness with toughness (every Starwars fan dream girl) and Scott Sendelweck as Dennis Bayder, who is actually quite capable of better performances. Apollo Bacala is hilarious and effortless as Melvin Lucas and provides the only true belly laughs of the entire film.<br /><br />Being able to point to the many locales I know of personally and smile and say "hey, they're at so and so..." doesn't make up for the fact that this film falls flat on its face and furthers the notion that the Indy film scene is as pathetic as it is amateur.
