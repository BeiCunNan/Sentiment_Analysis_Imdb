This movie hardly qualifies as a werewolf movie. You could take the werewolf out of the picture and basically be left with "Clue" as different character types (the actress, the doctor, and even the professor!) try to figure out who is killing the other guests within the castle...or in this case, who the werewolf is. I think one element pivotal to werewolf films is "the transformation" scene, and this movie robs its audience of this payoff. You don't really even need a budget to pull off some type of effect, but all this movie provides is a costume seen in close-up or in shadow, further removing the presence of the werewolf from this film. Even when the werewolf's identity is revealed, we don't get so much as a nifty contact lens effect or wry-fanged smile. Additionally distancing itself from the werewolf genre, the film isn't even scary. It lacks any real thrill or even gore. It's hard to stay interested as the film goes along because the characters we begin to sympathize with are each killed off in turn...which is fine as an element of surprise the first time it happens, but when it continually happens throughout the movie, the end result is that it distances the viewer and you're not left with much to care about. It really is, then, like a game of Clue, with about the same amount of depth, where characters are gradually eliminated one by one, merely for the sake of finding out who the killer really is, and not for suspense.<br /><br />I will say that it's nicely shot, the acting is above par for a low-budget video release, and for what it is--a somewhat awkward mystery--I guess it's OK. But a werewolf movie, it's not.
