I know this is Canada's first attempt at top model, but you would think after 6 seasons of ANTM they would have taken some notes. The first mistake they made was making Tricia Helfer the host. Yeah, she is gorgeous, but i had never even heard of her, when you think Canadian supermodel, you automatically think of Linda Evangelista. I heard she wasn't able to do it, so Tricia it is.<br /><br />First off, the girls are just SO ordinary looking. I've seen much more prettier girls at the mall and at school. They also seem so disinterested in modeling, except for maybe one or two, the rest of them seem so unsure. The majority of them had no clue how to walk on a runway, or even take a decent photo.<br /><br />The probably only exciting thing about the show is that Jay Manuel is in it, (photo shoot director from ANTM). He is Canadian, and you can tell by his facial expressions in the Canadian version, he must have been thinking "These girls really suck". I know they need a lot of practise and training, but the girls they picked are pretty awful. I would say the best picture of the bunch would be equivalent to the worst photo in the American version.<br /><br />Other than that, the background music will put you to sleep, the house is nice, but they could have added some colours to it instead of just making the entire decorations made out of wood. And Tricia? My, my, she needs A LOT of work, she has to be the most dullest, boring-est host i'v e ever seen. Don't bother watching it!
