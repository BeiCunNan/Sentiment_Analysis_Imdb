My wife and I saw this film yesterday and I thought that it was a pretty good movie. Of course, my motivation to see it was to get a look at Roselyn Sanchez and Sofia Vergara. I figured that my wife could have equal eye candy with the main actor who played Popi. It is interesting to note that this movie was directed by a Latina, and of course featured a great many latinos in the movie, with very few other ethnic actors. While I am caucasian, it didn't really bother me that there was only a couple of Anglo people in it, and only one African American I believe. But, as it was directed by a Latin woman, I was surprised at how much the movie seemed to be geared towards the Anglo-movie watching crowd. I don't have any problem with that and I feel that the director was really centered on empowering women, which is great. I just wonder if Latinos who watch this might feel themselves betrayed a bit by the Hollywood feel of this film. I don't think that it is a vehicle for too much serious lessons or life examples, and feel that it is more along the lines of just plain popcorn fun. Which in today's crummy world, is just fine to enjoy for a couple hours out of your day. I thought that it was a fun movie and I can spend all day looking at women like Roselyn Sanchez and Sofia Vergara. Who wouldn't drink dirty bath water from the likes of those two women? I know that I would be in line for a chance!! What absolute dream women!! HOT-CHA-CHA!!
