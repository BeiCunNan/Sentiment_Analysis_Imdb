This was lame even for a TV movie. The best part of the film was the first five minutes showing an assassination attempt on the President of the United States. After that, the film goes into free fall.<br /><br />Mariel Hemingway plays a secret service agent who is charged with guarding the President's self-absorbed teenage daughter on an outward-bound type trip of rafting, climbing and living in the wilderness for a week. The bad-guy militiamen kidnap the brat and all the force at the disposal of the United States is coalesced to rescue her.<br /><br />The entire story is so contrived and poorly presented that it is laughable. How lucky that of all the places on earth these militiamen could have gone hunting, they picked the same exact wilderness that the President's daughter was frolicking. Moreover, it was even more propitious that they happened to have all their high tech surveillance, radio and radar equipment with them while they were bow hunting.<br /><br />It was also extraordinarily fortunate that Agent McGregor (Hemingway), who had never attempted rock climbing in her life before this trip, was so instantly adept at it that her next climb was a two hundred foot vertical climb without tether. The ridiculousness they ask us to swallow continues unending.<br /><br />The action sequences were only fair, and the special effects were a joke. The music was awful and the film would cut to black for five seconds between certain scenes where the commercials would be placed. I don't even want to get into the acting. Dreadful.<br /><br />Even action junkies will be disappointed by this film. I rated it a 3/10. Miss it.
