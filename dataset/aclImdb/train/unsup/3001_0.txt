I don't know what was appealing about this movie, the lack of realism, the excellent character development, the beautiful shots, the acting, or the escapism into another reality: a Europeanized America. It was a little predictable, but the aspects that were predictable were done in a manner that was very imaginative. Bill Murray and Owen Wilson were great together. Steve Zissou(Murray) is one of the most lovable, strange, and thoroughly interesting characters I have ever encountered. Anjelica Huston presented us with some very real material, in her portrayal of Zissou's wife. I won't waste time trying to explain the plot, but I will recommend this movie to anyone who's willing to indulge in a (I stress the following word) smart and fun oceanic adventure.
