I am probably one of the minority of intelligent teens who liked the first movie (even though I have just turned 18).<br /><br />So I watched the second one and I have to say it was as terrible as a sequel can get. They used CARS. That might have been great for any other movie but seriously, making the Turbo Zords CARS? That's something I cannot believe.<br /><br />The movie concerns the Power rangers saving a wizard called Loriglot from evil being Divatox. And there were no fights. basically, it was a very disappointing movie. The only good point was the return of Kimberley. And the climax was exciting (albeit really really stupid)<br /><br />Other than that, stay away from this film at all costs.
