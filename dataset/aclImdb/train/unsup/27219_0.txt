When this show came on back in the mid-'90s, it was a treat for both kids and adults alike with likable characters, good stories and a great cast. What's great about this show is that it takes it's cues from the 1960's show and puts a modern spin on it. Everything from the beautiful Florida landscape to the enchanting "new age" soundtrack makes this show stand out from its 1960's grandfather. I'm sure many teenage boys enjoyed it just for Jessica Alba (though I admit I had a crush on her myself when I was a teenager) but I still loved it. Though it dealt with teen and adult issues, there were no sexual interludes that got in the way that shows nowadays have. It was a show that the whole family could watch and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys wholesome family entertainment or good shows in general ( though I would suggest watching the original seasons).
