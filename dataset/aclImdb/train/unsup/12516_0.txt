I have to say that I steer clear of most Korean movie. Thay are 97% of the time drawn out, dull and very boring. That being said, they have a few simply great movies. OldBoy, Musa and Tae Guk Gi. The Restless is advertised as a horror movie and this I do not know why? Hoewever as an action/fantasy/romantic movie it really works. The story is unique, the surprises are many and there are good characters.The character development is not of a Johhny To film and it could use another 20-30 minutes of backstory and character development, it works. Korean movies are a long way from being able to touch HK films, that being said, this is a very nice watch and if you catch it as I did without knowing anything going in, very good. Yes the leading actress is dull, yes the CGI could be better in places but it works and gets a 7-7.7 If you like this also try -Shinobi -Azumi -The Promise -Storm Riders -Zu Warriors<br /><br />Overall a good watch and worth a tub or popcorn!
