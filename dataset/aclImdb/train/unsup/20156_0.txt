Oh my gosh, I loved this movie. I highly recommend that everyone see it. It was absolutely wonderful. I plan to add it to my collection of videos. It was truly inspiring, heartfelt, moving, emotional, and clean. Definitely a movie worth watching with friends, family or just by yourself. It certainly sends out a true message of hope & love for all of mankind. That everyone and anyone can experience the true ultimate gift. I know it will touch the heart of all who watch it and give hope to everyone out their that a persons heart can really change when love, which is given to us by God because He first loved us, is practiced and felt in our lives. I thank God for His ultimate sacrifice and His free gift of salvation. I hope one day all with understand God love and how powerful it truly is in ones life. God Bless.
