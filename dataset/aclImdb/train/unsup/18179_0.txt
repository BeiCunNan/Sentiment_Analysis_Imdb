I saw this movie when I was around 13 years old.I felt the movie seemed a bit like a "movie of the week".<br /><br />The only great thing about this movie was the intro at the beginning and the theme of the movie.<br /><br />The intro (beginning credits) was a scary cartoon done in shadow.In the cartoon you see a woman giving birth to a baby to be quickly taken away by the "devil" who then eats the baby! Very strange to say the least.I tried to get the soundtrack on CD but I had to settle on getting a 12 inch record.<br /><br />When it came on DVD,I bought it just for the intro!
