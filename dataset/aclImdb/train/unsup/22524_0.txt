I almost can't believe a movie like this was even made... almost. Then I remember other extraordinarily bad movies such as "Pirrhana II- The Spawning" and I am no longer amazed that this movie was made; I just wonder how much the script sold for. I am convinced I could crank out three or four scripts of this caliber in one night's time. My advice to everyone is to watch this movie only on a bet or under the influence of a few beers. By the former, at least you are making money on the deal. By the latter, it is actually somewhat amusing and Denise Richards is easy on the eyes. There is nothing to be found here in the way of story, dialogue, or acting.
