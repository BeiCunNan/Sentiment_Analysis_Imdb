Honestly, by the time the cult members were drinking poisoned kool-aid, I was mixing up a batch of my own to put myself out of my freaking misery. Honestly, what were they thinking? Mulder discovering a past life where he was a Jewish woman during the Holocaust?!?! Seriously!! Oh, and he finds his soul mate from multiple past lives, never to be heard from again. And am I really supposed to believe that people get to choose with whom they return, and Cancer Man follows Mulder across the ages to torture him. Really? He can't find someone else to bug every other lifetime or so. I think Scully ought to get a medal for putting up with Mulder's crap. She lets him waste their precious time (time that ended up resulting in dozens of people chugging the red kool-aid) to go into his past lives, and he doesn't even stinking remember where the other bunkers are!!!! Wasn't that the whole point? I love Mulder and Scully, and the acting was passable, but I think I'll go ahead and pretend that this episode never happened. I get the idea that that's what the creators, writers, and directors did, since the supposed "insight" into Mulder's character is completely irrelevant for the rest an otherwise excellent series.<br /><br />muldernscully - I'm with you
