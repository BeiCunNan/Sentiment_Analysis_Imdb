Terrible film. It lost me from the beginning. Some guy is shot by the most conspicuous assassin ever seen. Who could fail to spot an albino in a medieval cassock ? Where did he think he was, a fancy dress ? Then the mortally wounded guy runs around the Louvre leaving riddles in his own blood. Ever heard of a mobile phone ? Tom Hanks, Professor of Silly Nonsense at Harry Potter university doesn't make a move on Audrey Tatou. Some stuff happens and they're in a van. Ian McKellen can afford a villa in Portugal by hamming it up egregiously.<br /><br />Apparently this film and book offended some peoples imaginary friend.I can see why, such a waste of money when people are going hungry.<br /><br />Raspberries all around.
