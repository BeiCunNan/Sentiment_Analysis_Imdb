I Think this is a great movie and ill tell you the reasons why. it shows a story of self struggle and change of times. Also the mutiny that puck has to go through once johnny black showed up and created in sense a total hell for him. i think that this movie should be shown at schools but of course an edited version this movie showed me that you must help out friends and that you should be careful on who you let in to your life also you should also keep your eyes open on problems to stop them before they become worse. spoiler coming up ill have 5 slashes to tell you when I'm done spoiling. when double d starts to become crazy puck only thinks about himself he should of realized the problem before he passed and i was so happy when puck put all the bad neo-nazi's to sleep because he was standing up for himself. this movie also gave a good idea for and hitchhikers./////. this movie is definitely worth checking out whether you like it or not it shows a great message. thanks for reading bye
