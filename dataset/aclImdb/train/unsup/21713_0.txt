I have to comment on Galloway Grumblefield's reply because I'm another white person (20-something male) who share's his/her sentiments and then some. The movie speaks for itself and I'd definitely recommend the miniseries "Into the West" as well which stars some of the same characters from Dreamkeeper. There are no words to describe the emotion that fills within me when thinking about the lives of American Indians. To me they should be regarded as the "super-race" for the sheer fact that they, along with the Buffalo, after being not only marginalized, tokenized, robbed, and yes, decimated almost to literal extinction (remember, even the kids and babies were shot by the U.S. army), they, into the new millennium are still here and their numbers have increased (as of the year 2000 there are about 2 and 1/2 million Native Americans alive today). Of course they're the poorest demographic in the country, worse than that of other minorities, comparatively speaking, and still are facing repression and other forms of harassment and forced relocation by the U.S. government (now empire). The good note is that films such as these shed light on the true nature of the Indigenous American as well as expose the inhumane and inhuman treatment (which exists TO THIS DAY) that they have endured on soil that belonged and by human rights still belongs to them. A progressive people's movement, which already exists, although pathetically fragmented since 9/11, needs to come together and at the center of it needs to be the will of the Native American, even spearheaded and centered around them. Justice needs to finally take its course. There are hundreds of activist websites dedicated to progressing the Indian cause, all a google search away.
