Despite the ridiculous plot, this shows what a very strong pair of actors (Heston and Zerbe) and a very visually arresting director (Boris Sagal), and a strong musical talent (Ron Grainer) can do, to say the least of Richard Matheson who is an acknowledged wizard in the field of paranoid science fiction (a particular genre).<br /><br />The film is gut-wrenching on many levels and is one of my top 20 films. Heston does the loner better than any other actor.<br /><br />Grainer, who scored the remarkable score for McGoohan's Prisoner series, is in fine form, with an excellent score.<br /><br />Sagal's visuals are absolutely gripping.<br /><br />Zerbe is the perfect antagonist and shows that his TV persona works perfectly on the silver screen.<br /><br />If you get the movie, turn the lights down and watch it at night. You're in for a treat.<br /><br />Many good lines in this movie.
