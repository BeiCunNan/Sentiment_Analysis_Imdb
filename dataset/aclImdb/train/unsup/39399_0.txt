I felt ill after 5 minutes. <br /><br />I have no idea if the storyline is good or not.<br /><br />What genius decided to use that cool-jerky-docu-style camera work for the entire movie ????<br /><br />I have homemovies that are easier to view than this.<br /><br />The opening scene in the office was a little amusing and I wondered whether the character would brazen it out when he received the call from his boss. <br /><br />It's a pity really because based on the opening scene(s) I would have viewed the entire movie.
