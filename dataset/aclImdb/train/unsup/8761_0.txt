Woodstock was and is the greatest music festival ever (Woodstock 99 sucked big time and is a disgrace for the name).<br /><br />I've got the Director's cut which is much longer than the 1970 version. The appearances on Woodstock are simply the best: Richie Havens, Ten Years After, Crosby-Stills-Nash & Young, The Who(my favorite band), Jimi Hendrix etc.<br /><br />The message of the festival and the movie (anti-war) is very clear and the people are as you would expect (very high!). Also some habitants and policemen of nearby villages are being interviewed, this is quite hilarious. They don't understand the ideas and visions of the visitors.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the sounds that all these musicians gave to the liberal Americans and the liberal world and I hope that it will remain in our minds that war is never the correct answer.
