put this on the long list of movies that had a slight potential of being good, but ended up being terrible. the idea that humans are gong to start eating each other after the gas supply runs out is completely ridiculous. the whole plot seems like something someone would come up with after a few too many at a wannabe goth convention. tack on terrible acting, high school play quality dialog, a completely failed attempt at directing, and overdone cinematography (cameras at off angles, long shots of abandoned cities) and you have a movie that should be left to collect dust in the dark corners of your local blockbuster. a good quote from the movie to sum up the viewing experience: "i just want the pain to go away."
