i first saw this in 1992 and was amazed how this series captured what can happen in real life. the past few years i have tried to get a copy of it with out much luck till recently, it cost me a lot but it will always take pride of place in my movie collection.I think the combination of Sam Neil and Peter Strauss was in part the making of this mini series, they are both fine actors and played their parts to perfection, my partner would not have even considered watching something like this normally but sat through it because i had raved about it for so long and when it had finished he had tears in his eyes and said DAM BRILLIANT,he enjoyed it, and was glad that he had taken the time to watch it.
