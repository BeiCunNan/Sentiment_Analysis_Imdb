When i first heard That 80s show i thought it was just a rip off of That 70s show, but i was totally wrong. Don't get me wrong that 70s show is alright but that 80s show is sick as. The cast is brilliant. There is a good blend of different characters, which gives the show a good mix and if the show hadn't got canceled there was a lot of potential to work with. Roger is so funny, his dancing, his hair, Katie is silly and cute, Margret knows everything, Corey and Tuesday's(hot) relationship is a great angle. I just wish they will bring it back. Even Owen does funny stuff. Come on wake up people! This show is a class above. Bring it BACK! They always cancel the good shows. Every episode makes me laugh so hard that my stomach starts to hurt!<br /><br />P.S. Bring it back! This show Rocks! Roger: "Why does bad things happen to people with good hair!"
