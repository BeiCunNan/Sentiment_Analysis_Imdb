I have an unnatural bias against this film. First off, Paul Green is one of the worst people that I have ever met, and this documentary falsely glamorizes him as some sort of savior of rock & roll. Wrong. Paul Green is a failed musician, who got a good idea in his head. And even though I believe that his teaching methods should be classified as child abuse and should be thrown in prison, the idea worked. You may wonder, why do I have such a strong hatred for the guy, well, here's a little back story.<br /><br />I was a student at Rock School for year when I was 13 and was the subject of much derision and psychological abuse from both other students and Paul himself. I only stayed for a year, because I learned a lot of my guitar teacher Nate, and enjoyed playing with the other students who didn't hate me. Fast forward 4 years later, after seeing this film, and looking for work in the music business, I got the chance to co-direct a show for the school, and for all the hard work I put into that, was (methaphorically) thrown under the bus by the institution.<br /><br />As for the film. I was definitely excited at first, but after being back in the belly of the beast and being treated so horribly, I curse this film and the subject.<br /><br />However, I certainly give all the props in the world to the kids who can stomach Paul and his despicable actions, and yet come out of it with a great talent. And I do have the deepest respect for my peers from my time at Rock School who have successfully developed their talents, and gone on and become successful. As for Paul, go f--- yourself.
