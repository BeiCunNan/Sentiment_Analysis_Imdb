If it was a spoof it would have been at least excusable, but the fact that it was meant to be taken seriously places this godawful movie in the "So bad it's actually bloody excruciating" category. Predictable, plodding, dull as dishwater, the movie only managed to make we wish I was blind so I wouldn't have to suffer it any longer. When the stricken junkie thief, his acting so awful it was actually physically painful to watch, threw himself on the third rail in a fit of drug crazed grief, I knew I was watching something really special. Special in the way that dentists have when they do root canal work without anaesthetic. Avoid this pile of excrement at all costs. You'll thank me for it.
