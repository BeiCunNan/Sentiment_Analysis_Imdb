What is a Sky Pilot? That's a nickname for a preacher. John Bowers stars as a missionary to a rural area filled with rough cowboys who mock religion. He has trouble converting the area, aside from one friend and a beautiful girl (Colleen Moore) that he falls in love with.<br /><br />For the most part, nothing much happens in this film. It is short, but hardly sweet. There is a lot of time spent waiting for the characters to do something. The romantic relationship is hardly developed, and the real attraction to this movie, Moore, is barely in the movie.<br /><br />If you like westerns or early, somewhat primitive films, this one is for you. If you're a Moore collector, grab this one, but don't stress over it. It probably will never be a favorite.
