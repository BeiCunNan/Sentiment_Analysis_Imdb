This movie isn't about how guns are out of control in America. It's about a bunch of otherwise talented actors making fools of themselves. Like the NRA says, guns don't kill people, people kill people. The people in this movie are too stupid to know how to operate a gun. The hype about guns was obviously just added on to try to impart some import to an otherwise painfully awful movie. It is jaw-droppingly awful. It's also not a comedy. There is nothing even remotely funny about it. Not a single scene, not a single line is funny. Nor is it satire. The talent gathered for this mess should be ashamed of themselves.
