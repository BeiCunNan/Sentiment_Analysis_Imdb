It's been nothing but trouble lately, for the two managers of the Lotus Cat Food Co. The gravedigger who's been supplying them with their food's main ingredient--freshly disinterred human cadavers--has been pestering them for monies due, and a suspicious doctor and his hotty blond nurse have taken to snooping around the premises, after the cats that consume their product have begun to turn into maniacal killers. Anyway, that's the setup for Ted V. Mikels' 1972 shlock classick "The Corpse Grinders," a distinct improvement on his previous horror film, 1967's "The Astro-Zombies" (one of filmdom's all-time worst) but not by much. That previous film had boasted a nearly incomprehensible plot and was truly a mess; "The Corpse Grinders" at least has a story that hangs together, outlandish as it may be, although the acting, scripting, editing and camera-work are all fairly inept. By any objective standard that one might wish to use, this film is hopeless garbage, but STILL, somehow, it manages to entertain, what with its one-of-a-kind plot, a few scantily clad women, some grotesque characters (a one-legged mute secretary in a fright wig; the gravedigger's wife who talks incessantly to her doll) and some mild gross-out scenes (a cat dissection; bloodied-up cat attack victims; the freshly ground "meat"--in actuality, probably hamburger meat or Play-Doh--being pushed out of the grinder) that should gross out only the most squeamish. And, at only 71 minutes in length, the film grinds by fairly quickly. Thank goodness!
