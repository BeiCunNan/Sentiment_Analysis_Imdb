The creator of Hot Shots brought this film that tries to be funny.I expected a funnier film. I wasted 4 bucks on this movie. The spoofs get over used to the the point of stupidity. Don't waste your money on this film either by go see it or by renting it. I'm not looking forward to the Titanic spoof which the creator of this film is producing and writing.
