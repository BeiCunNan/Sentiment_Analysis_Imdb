If I hadn't been with a friend, trapped in the middle of a row in the theater where I saw this movie, I would have left within the first five minutes. As a New Yorker working in the media industry, I was insulted and disgusted. I've worked with a lot of writers, editors, and publishers, some of which were mentioned in this movie, and they are nothing like the ones portrayed here. <br /><br />Sure, the cast is great and acting excellent, but the premise, story, and plot is a big fat "0." The formulaic writing kept the shallow characters going around in predictable circles. How interesting and exciting for them.<br /><br />I regret that I wasted $10.50 and two hours (plus thirty minutes of ads and previews) on this movie.
