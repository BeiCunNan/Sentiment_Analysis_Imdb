I have seen this beautiful movie at our German language institute last week. The spoken language in this film is Swiss German and I could understand just a little from it. Swiss Dialect sounds very different from standard German. It was my first film experience from Switzerland and fortunately it was very good and satisfying. <br /><br />I have seen many German films (from Germany or Austria) but this film was the first one which made me laugh! It was very funny and happy specially the part in which Vitus said to his teacher about James Watt. Against most German films which have a cold and unpleasant atmosphere (for example: Funny Games, The Hotel or The thin drum) this film ended happily.<br /><br />The story is pretty simple and straightforward. No violence, no nude scene, no drug use. Everything seems to be in its natural form.<br /><br />The role playing was very good. Specially Bruno Ganz. I have seen three films from him: Downfall, Wings of desire and Nusferato: Phantom of Night". In Downfall he played the role of Hitler, In Wings of desire he was an angel wandering in streets of Berlin and listening to different people's thoughts, In Phantom of night he played the role of a young man who is somehow unemotional and cold and ultimately causes Cont Dracula come to town. I love all of these plays. and yet I have seen a totally different playing role from Bruno Ganz in Vitus: A Grandpapa who loves his grandson and are best friends. The relationship between Vitus and Grandfather is very interesting.<br /><br />I recommend this film to everyone who enjoys watching a different, 2 hours long and slow but happy and funny film.<br /><br />My rating is 8/10.
