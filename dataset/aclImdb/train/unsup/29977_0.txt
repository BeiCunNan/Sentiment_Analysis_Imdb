One might be tempted to compare this movie, with its face to face dialogue and "complex" charaterizations, with DINER or THE BIG CHILL, but that would be unfair to those who are the professionals in the craft of acting. I have no idea what the director of this film was thinking (if there WAS a director), other than a desire to give some out of work actors a chance to show why they ARE out of work. They mumbled their way through the dialogue like even THEY can't wait till the movie is over. There is absolutely NO expressions on their faces when delivering their lines, and the camera roams around the room as if its hunting for a place to rest, further diminishing from what could have been a decent putting forth, had the material been put into the hands of a TALENTED cast and crew. Honestly, it would have been more understandable to have 4th or 5th graders in front of the camera reading the lines from their script pages. I have refrained from being MORE direct lest one of the actors from the movie (probably STILL out of work) stumble upon this review. TWO LOUD YAWNS!!
