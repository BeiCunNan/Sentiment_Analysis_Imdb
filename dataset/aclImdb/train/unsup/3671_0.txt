I recently saw this at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival and five minutes into the film I noticed several people walking out on it. I guess they didn't realize that it's title In Bed was a film about two people in bed. This is no bed-in with John and Yoko though. It's a nice character study of two people out for a one night stand in a hotel room after meeting at a party. Lots of lovemaking and small talk turns into confessions of the soul. It's a darkly lit room and only takes place in one room with no additional scenery so it has a little of a claustrophobic feel to it at first but the fairly weak script is delivered well in word and expression from it's two talented and attractive cast members Blanca Lewin as Daniela and Gonzalo Valenzuela as Bruno. Lewin is clearly the star here and I would like to see more of her. Well, I've seen about as much of her as nature created but I would like to see her acting again. I can't believe this film had two costume designers in the credits since there are only three items, one bra, one pair of panties and one pair of men's underwear in the entire film. Two set decorators seem a little excessive too unless they created this set from scratch but it looks like an actual hotel room that they simply brought their cameras into. This is a very small low budget film and has it's flaws but it worked for me and I liked it. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.
