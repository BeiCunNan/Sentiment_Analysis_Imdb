I caught about 15 minutes of Cashmere Mafia (gets my vote for Worst Overall) and was sorely disappointed. I was very excited about LJ. Now, I am happy that the show seemed to flow from the beginning. I am hooked. I just want to be entertained. There is not much on t.v. these days that can pull me away from work. I don't think you can compare to Sex in the City, but this is definitely a chick show. And, I really, really want Andrew back for more. I like him anyway, but having him play a freakin' billionaire makes me over the top crazy. I just want to slap Victory when she starts that "I don't need you to rescue me" stuff. Move over V, he can rescue me anytime.
