Die Hand Die Verletzt (German for "the hand that wounds") is another gem from the pen of Glen Morgan and James Wong, the X-Files writing duo. This episode was directed by the excellent Kim Manners. It's his direction that helps this particular episode shine. I really liked at the beginning of the episode where the shot cuts from a hand on a teenage boy's throat to Scully's hand dropping the sheet covering the dead boy's body. Also, Scully's reaction as the toads drop from the sky is priceless. Although the PTC are the devil worshipers, Mrs. Paddock the substitute steals the show as the Devil(?). She manages to stay one step ahead of the the PTC and the FBI. This episode has a high scariness factor, so you might want to consider whether you watch it late at night or not. Beware that there is some disturbing subject matter regarding child abuse. So if you're in for a good scare, Die Hand Die Verletzt is the episode for you.
