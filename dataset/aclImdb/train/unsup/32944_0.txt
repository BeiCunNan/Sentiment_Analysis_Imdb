I do not see how people could give this movie such credit. PLEASE! The only part of this movie that caught my attention was the "stuck in the outback" scene and thats it! The affair is utterly shallow and boring. And the death is also very uninteresting.<br /><br />And as others have posted... The last act I was about to shut the television off. It was honestly 30 minutes of the same music, that was honestly a jackhammer to the head.<br /><br />All in all, this movie was completely dull and unengaging. 7.0 is ridiculous, I wonder what these other reviewers are thinking. <br /><br />-psilo
