You see so many telemovies on the same subject and most of them follow the same script lines. Mom At 16 started, and I had no intention of watching, leaving it on for background noise. But a few minutes in, and I was glued to the screen. The acting was convincing and the dialogue natural. The storyline didn't follow the usual pattern, and the casting was well chosen. Mercedes Ruehl (Jacey's mum) has had several roles like this, and I thought at first that I'd find that off-putting. But she played it so convincingly and I felt her love for her daughter and her fierce determination to protect her family. I loved seeing Jane Krakowski in something after Ally McBeal, showing her definite talents as a dramatic actress. Overall, this telemovie had me so involved I felt Jacey's emotions with her, and at the end I couldn't even read the credits through my tears. Well acted, well scripted and well made. Surprisingly good for a midday movie and one that I'd happily (in tears!) watch again.
