This movie was utterly obnoxious. All the jokes were trite, slapstick humor and could be seen a mile away. The acting was stilted at best and downright awful at worst. It was overdone both acting wise and in the direction. Not that one would expect greatness from a Jaime Kennedy movie but I thought it would at least be entertaining. Unfortunately, this was not the case. It was the worst movie I have ever sat through at the theater. Had I paid money instead of seeing a special screening I would have demanded a refund after ten minutes. Don't bother spending your money on this film, wait three months, it will be out on cable its that bad.
