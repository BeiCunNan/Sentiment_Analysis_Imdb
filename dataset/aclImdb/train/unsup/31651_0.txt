This film was shown here in London during the Foreign film exhibition together with other remarkable Filipino films like Imelda, American Adobo...etc....the venue was a bit small( Riverside Cinema)thou the number of Filipinos base in London is quite large now but still of many reasons, Non Filipino viewers are more than our "Kababayans", i cant say that Filipinos are not movie goers cos it's not true. Maybe because most of them here are westernised now, so they prefer to watch English spoken films.....well thats a sign that they are so easy to adapt(positive outlook in life). The ticket is very reasonable and if you will rent a pirated DVD from Filipino supermarket they charge more and very bad reception. It was well advertised too that so many fliers and leaflets were given away in all Filipino shops, remittance office, Filipino beauty saloons and anywhere as long as there is Filipino......But why so limited of Filipino watched it????? It is because most of them(Filipino) has no culture and cant appreciate the real art.... its a shame and sad to admit but its true. where is the nationalistic campaign of us before that goes this way???....TANGKILIKIN ANG SARILING ATIN.....We need more films like this to uplift our country and people in the world map.
