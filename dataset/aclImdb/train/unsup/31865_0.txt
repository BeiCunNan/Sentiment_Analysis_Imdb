Before watching this film,I was thinking in this:''Another Asian horror movie.I think there will be the female ghost with a long black hair''.Long Khong uses that but its narrative took different ways for telling the story,which may not be too original,but at least,they are different than a lot of Asian horror films.That thing made me enjoy the film pretty much because that helps for creating an exotic tone which makes the movie really unpredictable.This film has some fails,like some scenes which are a little boring.Also,the ending was forced.But,in spite of that,Long Khong is ingenious,fun,unpredictable and very gory.And I really appreciated that.
