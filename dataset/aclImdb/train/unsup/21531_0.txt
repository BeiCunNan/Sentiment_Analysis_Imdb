This film is absolutely gorgeous and worth every moment. It's a Native American film that touches aspects of "Indian blood," the process of growing into a man, and moral/familial conflicts. Hunter is a dynamic character with facets that evolve as the film grows. For a film, I was blown away by the character progression. Hunter's story crosses ethnic lines and appeals to all audiences.<br /><br />Deeply personal, quietly understated film. If you have an interest in Native American culture or really just appreciate a perfect script and a beautifully made film, then this is your movie.<br /><br />Randy Redroad came to my school to speak and present two of his films, "Doe Boy" and "133 Skyway." My favorite part is when he said something along the lines of:<br /><br />"When I review films and I am on the panel, oftentimes it's all PhDs and me. We review films and everyone says 'this reminds me of this' or 'this film was reminiscent of this' but you know what? Look at the film for what it is. You know, good for you that you memorized an author, what do you FEEL?"<br /><br />After that he quoted a line from a Woody Allan film where Diane Keaton is looking at a painting and refers the painting to another artist "but without the wit." It was an eye-opening experience to hear him say this, something I had honestly never thought about before. But Randy Redroad is right, what does anything really mean without the emotion?<br /><br />This is the type of film you're lined up for... by an incredible artist.
