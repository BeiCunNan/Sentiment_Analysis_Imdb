I have to admit that Tobe Hooper's career has taken a nosedive. That said, his most recent effort, 2004's Toolbox Murders (not to be confused with the 1978 crap fest of the same name and similar plot) is much more than one would expect. Nell Barrows (the underrated Angela Bettis) and her husband Steven move into a historic Hollywood apartment building, full of old world charm (constant construction, odd symbols, hair and teeth hidden in the walls) and charismatic people (a hippie chick who sings late into the night, a teen who uses his computer skills to spy on women, a pathetic but suspicious handyman). Naturally, tenants begin to disappear without a trace, and Nell (already troubled by the recent death of her father) finds herself in your average "people are being murdered and no one believes me until they get killed" situation. When a trusted friend (Juliet Landau) goes missing, its up to Nell to try and save her.<br /><br />The acting is top notch, and there are parts that actually made me jump, something few horror movies are able to accomplish anymore. The ending is a ripoff of another, more popular film (I wont say which), but overall, I'd give Toolbox Murders 7/10. USELESS FACTS: Look for Sheri Moon Zombie as Daisy Rain, the first victim; The writers of Toolbox Murders, Jace Anderson and Adam Gierash (who played handyman Ned), were later chosen by none other than Dario Argento to write the screenplay for the long-awaited third installment in the three Mothers trilogy, the recently announced Mater Lachrymarum.
