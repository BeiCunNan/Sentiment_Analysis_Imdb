Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin reprise their roles from Saturday Night Live on to the big screen. The film is filled with countless classic cameos that really make this film. Jason Alexander as the follically challenged neighbor and Chris Farley as Connie Conehead's boyfriend are especially hilarious. I really wondered if you could pull off a feature film from basically a 5 minute TV skit...but the script is so well written with so many funny jokes...David Spade is another who delivers line after line as the smarmy kiss butt assistant to Michael McKean's character. But its the talent of Aykroyd and Curtin, two comedy veterans who really drive this one home. Laughs all around, I loved it!
