A friend of mine recommended this movie, and I must say, it was horrible! It may be the worst movie I`ve ever seen. I dont´t know, if the original version contains any esprit in the dialogues, but the german version hasn´t. It was worst trash. Yes, the intention of the author and director, obviously was making a trash movie, but not in this way. I think this movie should be a comedy, but i never smiled during watching it. The so-called jokes, were ... No, better no comment. On the other hand, this movie is that extraordinary bad, you should see it - the only place for this movie is the flop 100 list. 1 of 10 are even too much...sorry!
