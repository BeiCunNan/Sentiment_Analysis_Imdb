I'm a huge fan of Jack Lemmon. I loved him in the Apartment and the Odd Couple. Out-of-Towners is a timeless classic comedy in my opinion. I mean come on! Jack Lemmon in a Neil Simon story? How can you go wrong with that? There are alot of funny lines that Jack Lemmon uses that makes the movie what it is. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the role of George Kellerman. This movie is a definte classic comedy that will never be forgotten.
