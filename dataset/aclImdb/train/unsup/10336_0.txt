As a fond of Ozon I was really happy, when Russia became the first country where "Sous le sable" was presented. It's an enigmatic film about an elderly woman, who tried to find her husband. On the beach he went to swim and disappeared. This mystery ruined her life, she tried to substitute husband by lover but failed. "Sous le sable" is a dainty French film about a lone elderly woman under the sand of time. I recommend the film to all fans of good European cinema.<br /><br />
