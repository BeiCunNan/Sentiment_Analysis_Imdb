I love 'The Pirates of Penzance'! Jon English, Simon Gallaher and Derek Metzger are all fantastic as their respective characters. My favourite person in this is Helen Donaldson, who is an absolutely adorable Mabel. Her voice is lovely and she hits every high note. She looks like a 10-year-old in 'When the Foeman Bares His Steel' though! Essgee have done a great job in updating a G&S show and I admit its not one for purists! Toni Lamond, the first woman to ever appear on Australian television, is a very sad, yet funny (!), Ruth. All of the songs in it are fantastic, even if they are all performed on synthesisers. Gallaher's rendition of 'Oh Is There Not One Maiden Here' is very sweet and heart-melting. Donaldson's 'Poor Wandering One' is AMAZING! Her coloratura is very well done. English's comic timing is great, especially 'Dear Pirate King I love your purple pants...' and he performs well with the other cast members, especially Toni Lamond, Helen Donaldson and Simon Gallaher. Any fan of musicals, especially Australian, should see this!
