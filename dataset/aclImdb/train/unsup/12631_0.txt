This film was a real snooze-fest interrupted by brief flashes of action. In fact, most of the action took place at the beginning and the end. You could skip the whole middle.<br /><br />Dolph Lundgren sure didn't show the action hero we saw in The Punisher or Universal Soldier as a demolitions expert in taking apart land mines.<br /><br />Claire Stansfield was equally flat as the woman who recruited him to help rid Angola of a new type of mine.<br /><br />Someone even compared Lungren to Commando Arnold. What a joke!<br /><br />I imagine that there is a market for movies like this in foreign countries.
