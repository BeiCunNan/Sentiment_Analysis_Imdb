For my school's One-Act (Fall) play, we chose to do a Holocaust play and compete with it at region competition. To get into the spirit of the time, we watched Holocaust films and traveled to the Anne Frank museum. This was one of the first films we watched, and it was so amazing. Usually when watching films, you can easily reassure yourself that everything's going to be OK, and that it's all fake anyway; or that it never happened. That's not possible in this movie. It did happen, and being aware that it did and remembering will help heal the lasting wounds and make sure something like that never happens again. This movie makes us all think about the past, the present, the future, and life in general.The finer things in life are not material possessions, but family, friends, and love that should be the foundation for anything.This movie is simply amazing and so profound.
