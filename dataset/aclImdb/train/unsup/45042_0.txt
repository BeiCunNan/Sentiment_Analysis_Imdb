Three friends with big faces go to an island to relax by chasing a deer to death with dogs. There's so many over-sized faces at the start of this movie it's like watching Easter Island statues bobbing around. This merry jaunt is interrupted when some giant wasps kill one of them.<br /><br />This film is full of laughs, most of which come from the unconvincing giant animals. The rats look OK in close up but the giant chicken is one of the funniest monsters I've ever seen and easily the highlight of the entire film.<br /><br />I liked the character development too. They want to show that the businessman is a real typical 70's businessman jerk so there's one line where he stands opening a gate and says "open the god dam gate" for no obvious reason. Granted it's not quite on a par with a giant chicken head pecking at you but it made me laugh all the same. The crazy religious woman is equally subtly sketched with her endless talk of sin. The ultra-hostile "female bacteriologist" is pretty funny too. Check out the bit where her biological clock goes off during a rat attack. Funny stuff.<br /><br />The whole movie is pretty much rats being shot with paint ball pellets while roaring like a tiger and climbing on a dolls house. The basic fact that rats can swim doesn't fit with the ending so there's a clunky scene where we get told that giant rats can't swim. They can't swim OK, and we're not just saying that because we've already filmed the ending before someone pointed out that they can swim.<br /><br />Also, how come there's a dam on an island in the first place? Geography wasn't my best subject but wouldn't that mean the island was lower than the level of the water? <br /><br />If you've seen any of Big Berts other movies you'll know what to expect. Definitely one for bad movie fans only!
