This is a really fun film with story and actors that make you feel their joy and their pain. I was surprised to catch pieces of this on cable, laughing so much that I had to look up the schedule to catch the whole movie the next time it was played.<br /><br />It was an intelligent movie with good intercharacter relationships. I really would like to find more movies by the writer/director Stefan Schwartz, but there doesn't seem to be anything recent on IMDB. The three main actors (Dan Futterman, Stuart Townsend and Kate Beckinsale) really seemed to enjoy working together on-screen.
