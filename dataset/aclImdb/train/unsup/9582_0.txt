I highly anticipated this film, as it received mostly great reviews & was given many award nominations. What I saw was a picture post card of beautiful Paris & surrounding areas, nicely acted by all. BUT where oh where was the story, The film ran over 2 hours, That was 40 minutes longer than it deserved. When are we going to see films about happy nice people living their lives & not neurotics like displayed here. This was supposed to be a comedy & I hardly laughed lightly more than twice. Rating **1/2 78 points IMDb 7
