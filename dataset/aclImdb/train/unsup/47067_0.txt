After a variety of sketchy farcical/romantic complications, the movie settles for a sentimental epilogue, and remains unsurprisingly dull. The biggest shock is Andrew Dice Clay - the comedian you love to boycott - whose 'Vin-Man'character utterly fails to get laughs transforming himself from a macho beast to a caring, sharing New Man via the 'Pretend You're Sensitive Handbook'.<br /><br />Definitely a lightweight movie, without any heavy ambitions, and for the most part an unlikable one. With script and direction by women, it's considerably more arch and dehumanized than the usual sex comedy. Most of the men in this film are portrayed as belonging to a disgustingly hairy, penile-obsessed subspecies.
