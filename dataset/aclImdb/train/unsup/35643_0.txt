My brother loved this movie and encouraged me to watch parts of it so I did and that was enough for me!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was the biggest waster of time I have ever seen. There is no such thing as a storyline and the acting is terrible!!!! Take my advice and DO NOT watch this movie!!! If you do you will want all that time you spent watching it back. Anyone who likes this movie is crazy, I don't know how ANYONE can like this movie. It is probably the WORST movie ever made. If you don't believe me see for yourself and you'll know what I mean. One of the worst parts is that the people who made this movie were actually trying to make a real movie-they definitely could of fooled me.
