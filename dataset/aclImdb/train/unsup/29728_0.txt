This was an entertaining cartoon, but what made it was Granny. I love how she defends Tweety by bashing Sylvester on the head with her umbrella. Sylvester is his crafty and rambunctious self, and Tweety is still cute. This wouldn't be possible without the vocals of Mel Blanc, is there anything this genius cannot do? Seemingly not. Characters aside, Sylvester's attempts to capture Tweety are funny and devious, using various disguises including a street monkey. Also the animation smooth and colourful, and the music(such as the simple "I am a Tweety who lives in a cage") is well done. Overall, well worth seeing, not the best of the Looney Tunes canon or the best Sylvester and Tweety cartoon but definitely a good one. 9/10 Bethany Cox
