I saw the Harvard Man in France, so by the time it reaches the U.S., the movie may be completely dismantled and reworked. But I doubt that such repairs could rescue the film from the wreckage I saw. The plot is uninteresting -- not to mention far-fetched -- teaming poorly developed characters against one another in a want-to-be teenage-comedy-thriller-mystery music video. The acting is stilted and achingly forced... which is what we've come to expect from the average Eric Stoltz, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Adrian Grenier. Director James Toback does try to make the movie visually interesting, but its excesses result in overstimulation that is hyperactive and annoying.
