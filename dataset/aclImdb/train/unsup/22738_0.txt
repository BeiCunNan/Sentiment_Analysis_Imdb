I was really excited about Saawariya when I first heard about it, but then my enthusiasm waned when I saw the promos for OSO. I wasn't expecting much from Saawriya, the promos looked so exaggerated. I went into the 2.30 session, with my sisters, and we were the only ones there!<br /><br />The movie does not drag on. It is well paced. The sets are beautiful, but it's so dark and gloomy, and after a while you start missing daylight. The songs are picturised nicely, but because the movie is 2.5 hours, i don't think any of the songs are the complete track. Just bits and pieces.<br /><br />Ranbirs exaggerated facial expressions suit his character. Its not a case of bad acting, its just how his character is. The characters in most SLB movies are usually out of this world...a little larger than life. Sonam cries and laughs too much, other than that she doesn't do much. She is very pretty. Rani is gorgeous. And oozes charisma. Salman...(this coming from a huge fan) I'm slightly disappointed. Anyone could have played his part. Nothing out of the ordinary. For once he is restrained and doesn't overact because he doesn't have much of a character. I give it 8/10. PS The flash of Ranbirs bum is done in good taste...and he's actually kinda cute!
