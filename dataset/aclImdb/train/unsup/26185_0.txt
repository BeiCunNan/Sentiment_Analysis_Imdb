Shrewd, resourceful and formidable old battleaxe Claire Marrable (superbly played to the icy hilt by Geraldine Page) loses both her husband and her affluent lifestyle. Ms. Marrable moves to Arizona, starts a pine tree garden, and begins bumping off her elderly housekeepers for their life savings so she can continue living high on the hog. Ms. Marrable meets her match in her new housekeeper Alice Dimmock (a terrific performance by the wondrous Ruth Gordon), a cheery, smart and resilient little firecracker who suspects that something is amiss. Director Lee H. Katzin and screenwriter Theodore Apstein expertly create a deliciously sinister atmosphere, relate the engrossing story at a steady pace, and top everything off with a wickedly funny sense of pitch-black humor. This movie further benefits from fine acting from an excellent cast: Page really sinks her teeth into her juicy evil old bat role, Gordon projects her usual winningly spunky charm as the endearingly feisty Ms. Dimmock, plus there are sturdy supporting contributions from Rosemary Forsyth as sweet young widow neighbor Harriet Vaughn, Robert Fuller as the dashing Mike Darrah, Mildred Dunnock as the timid Edna Tinsley, Joan Huntington as Ms. Marrable's bitchy niece Julia Lawson, and Peter Brandon as Julia's conniving stockbroker husband George. The very ending offers one doozy of a marvelously ironic surprise plot twist while the arid desert setting adds to the overall creepy tone. Joseph Biroc's lush, vibrant cinematography makes neat occasional elegant use of fades and dissolves. Gerald Fried's moody, shivery, string-laden score likewise hits the spooky spot. Best of all, it's a total treat to watch Page and Gordon bounce off each other as they engage in a deadly game of wit and wills. A hugely enjoyable fright feature.
