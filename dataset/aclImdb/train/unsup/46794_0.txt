I used to like Will Ferrell..but after this, I have my doubts about his quality. This movie is unbelievably stupid...and I don't mean funny stupid, I mean I can't believe anyone would find such basic, simple, absolutely ridiculous jokes and situations, funny. It's an almost impossible task to watch it to the end as they get worse and worse. I felt so bad to have spent my money on such a poor poor comedy-wannabe movie. I just can't understand how this even got to the cinemas. And also how is it possible so many people found it funny?? Think twice before watching it, it doesn't bring anything useful to your life, doesn't even make you laugh.
