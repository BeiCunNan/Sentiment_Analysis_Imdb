What an under-rated movie. Coneheads actually proves to be one of the funnier SNL sketch spin-offs. Not as humorous as the Wayne's World movies, but a far cry from the dreadful Night at the Rocksbury and other Lorne Micheals productions. Coneheads is full of cameos including Adam Sandler, Jon Lovitz and Tom Arnold and great small parts by David Spade and Chris Farley. The characters are truly likeable and the Conehead family is genuine. The ending partly tarnishes the rest of the movie, possibly a reason for low ratings amongst critics. However, with a majority of past SNL characters, Coneheads lives up to the the original sketches with Dan Akroyd and Jane Curtin. Forget the critics and give Coneheads a second chance.
