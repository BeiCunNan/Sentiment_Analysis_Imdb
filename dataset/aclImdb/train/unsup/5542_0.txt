This version of the famous novel of Victor Hugo I found very suitable in general, with good acting and a narration, which give a real idea of the book. As I said several times several films never coincide with their original written versions, but this time the director Jean-Paul Le Chanois made a good effort in having a material as much similar to the book. Jean Gabin, for me the best all-time French actor, plays a good role as Jean Valjean seconded efficiently by Bernard Blier as Javert and several other French and Italian actors/actresses. I am sure that not all should agree with the opinion given here by me, but it depends how you feel about Hugo wrote. Misery is shown not only materially but spiritually as a sign of decaying society.
