A large percentage of mankind is afraid of animals like snakes, spiders... In the fifties horror movies always contained giant insects, probably because the creators thought this was the best way to scare the audience. But times have changed and so have people. We aren't afraid of giant insects on the silver screen anymore. That's why I thought the genre was already long death, but apparently I was wrong.<br /><br />"Spiders" got bad reviews and I really don't know what made me watch this movie anyway. It was probably the fact that I wanted to have a good laugh. That's right: a good laugh, because the spiders in this movie are so huge that it makes you forget that you should be scared. I'm sure that even people with arachnophobia wouldn't be terrified. <br /><br />The most frightening thing about this movie is perhaps the lack of a good story. A young female student is interested in UFO's and ET's and writes articles about it in the local college paper. She has done a lot of research and she has found a secret site called "Area 21" where the government is doing all kinds of secret stuff (no, I'm not making this up). It appears to be a site where scientists are experimenting with inserting the DNA of aliens into spiders to make giant killers. <br /><br />In the beginning, the movie looked promising (when the spiders were still small), but as it progressed it got worse and worse. It's just a mix-up of different stories which we all know all to well. Take scenes from Arachnophobia, Ticks, Alien, even King Kong together with some episodes from the X-Files and you know what you can expect. Well no, because than it might still have been quite good, but the directors made such a big mess out of it, that you can only laugh.<br /><br />My advise to everybody: don't rent or buy it, but watch it when it is shown on television. It's like a fifties horror movie, but than in color and there aren't many comedies that make you laugh more than this "horror" movie. I gave it a 3/10.
