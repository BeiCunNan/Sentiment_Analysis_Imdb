OK first off this is a bad film.No way putting that more straight forward.This movie has no story,no good characters,no good dialogue,nothing cool to wow,the effects are the same effects we've seen in zombie films of the 70 and 80,and this film also had special effects on a computer that looked completely fake.This terrible amateur film that never should have seen the light of day.Also this film has a terrible soundtrack.And to end my tyrant of hate for this films let me end with this that i hate that people don't understand what make a good,fun,scary and entertaining film.You have a good story,fun characters that you invest with,good effects not sloppy things like in this film,and slow moving zombies.Zombies shouldn't be running or walking like orcs like from the damm Lord of The Rings films i mean Jesus.Watch Night Of the Living Dead,Dawn of The Dead also the remake,Day Of the Dead,Land Of the Dead and Shaun Of The Dead.Also Zombie 2.These are zombie films not piece of garbage and just to take it as a B movie is not right.Its not even that funny its over the top nonsense.
