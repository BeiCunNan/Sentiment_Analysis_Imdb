This series had a lot of potential and I sat through 3 episodes of it. The hosts completely ruined it as they are so ignorant of travel and have nothing interesting to say other than a place being "incredible" or "awesome". They keep trying to justify the fact they are now "travellers" as they get an all expenses paid TV series around the world, and clearly had never stepped outside of their state back in America.<br /><br />For backpackers this series is a real turn off since everything they do is dependent on a guide and with 5 star luxuries from the hotels to the activities they do that most travellers would not afford (or care for). There is no sense of adventure or excitement here! They seriously need to go and do some travelling independently and really see the world!
