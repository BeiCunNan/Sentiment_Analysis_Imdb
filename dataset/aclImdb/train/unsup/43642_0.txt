I didn't know what the movie was all about, I thought it was just some plain racing like The Fast and the Furious, and if I am not mistaken, this was released by Universal or something. The movie starts with some one liners, but you don't really see any action pertaining to street racing. The only action you are going to see is the action between a male and a female character. I wish they categorized this more clearly. Having had watched porn before (who hasn't?) I can easily notice that the settings weren't exactly "cheap" but porn settings nonetheless. The lighting was good and the acting wasn't all that bad. There are no close up s of the genital areas and no "cum shots". Kind of annoying really, but at the same time, it is also entertaining.
