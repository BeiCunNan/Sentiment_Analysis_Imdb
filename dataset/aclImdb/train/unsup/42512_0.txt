1st watched 5/8/2005 - 4 out of 10(Dir-James L. Conway): Supposedly truth-inspired story about the US hiding information about a captured UFO being in it's midst. The problem here is that if this is really true we'd know a lot more about what they found out, unless you believe that politicians are more interested in themselves than the history of mankind as we know it.(OK, so that's not a complete stretch) Anyway, I digress. The story is played well by the actor's involved which include Gary Collins, James Hampton and Darren McGavin(in a somewhat hammy portrayal of a NASA man almost "giddy" about the discovery). The Astronauts witness a UFO, it gets shot by a launched satellite and a remnant falls to earth. That remnant is captured by a government and a secret investigation ensues. The astronauts on board are kept out of the loop and even blamed for the incident and the death of a co-pilot, and they begin a quest to find out what's going on. The action is watchable but we can see what's going to happen as the government gets a tighter reign on concealing the information. This movie was definitely inspired by the "Chariots of the God" type movies with a little bit of the National Enquirer and this is where it fails. And definitely, with it's open-ended finale it's even harder to believe. As entertainment, it's OK; as truth, it's suspect at best.
