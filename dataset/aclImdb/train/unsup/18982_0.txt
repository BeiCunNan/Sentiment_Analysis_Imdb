Critics and fans alike can rejoice with this, the newest feature from Germany's master of low-budget scares, Andreas Schnaas.<br /><br />ANTHROPOPHAGOUS 2000 is nasty, gruesome, and just completely sickening, but certainly fun to watch. Filmed with completely professional actors and in some gorgeous locations, its really true that Andreas has taken leaps and bounds in filmmaking. This worthy remake of THE GRIM REAPER could use only one thing - a U.S. release! Maybe then, fans could see the beauty of some true German madness!!!
