This movie was a pleasant surprise for me. Expecting a sentimental and preachy TV movie about the evils of racism, I was given a beautifully acted and subtle movie about how racism can develop and consume people. This happened primarily through the journey of the older brother - played superbly by Brendan Fletcher (who I'm sure is destined for Hollywood stardom). His hatred for the James Earl Jones character develops from his jealousy of the relationship Jones builds with his younger brother. His jealousy makes it easy for bigots to develop racism in him. It's also fascinating to see how Jones (what a great actor he is) is also almost consumed by racism in a totally different way, as his persecution starts to make him bitter and angry to all whites (even his young friend) and even to his own family.<br /><br />This is powerful stuff and the cast are all fine, including young Jake LeDoux and Wendy Crewson as the mother. The piece is also beautifully photographed, written and directed. I highly recommend this film - and look out for Brendan Fletcher!
