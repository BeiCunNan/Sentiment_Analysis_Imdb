This movie was great as I had very little expectations going in. The plot is very predictable and the characters are stereotypical, but if you're watching with some buddies it's a great picture to have a chuckle at. You have the sheriff's sidekick who looks like Ethan Hawk, a Wilfred Brimly look alike and the peer pressuring teenager. All together this movie scores for laugh ability. Think Dante's Peak and you will see every plot line. An authority figure who sees an epidemic on the horizon, money hungry investors not wanting the town to be in an uproar, heroics, and a tightly packaged ending that tells the viewer that everything is going to be okay.
