Not as bleakly derivative and shoddy as one might expect, Candyman 2 is still not all that inventive, original, or good as well. This time around the Candyman haunts New Orleans and a young, pretty teacher played by Kelly Rowan. Rowan, proving to her class that some urban legends have no basis in fact, looks in a mirror and says Candyman five times. Ohhhhh! We know what happens after that, and this film does all the expected with style if nothing else. Rowan's family, friends, and associates meet the hooks of the Candyman, and a hidden family secret which ties into the Candyman's past is presented. We learn why the Candyman is the way he is, etc... Okay, some of this was interesting, but much was just silly. Tony Todd gives another creepy, over-the-top performance as the man of dreams and pain(alright even now I am sounding like some of that tripe he spews). In some ways I enjoyed this film more than its original. The New Orleans setting is effectively shot and some of the character acting is decent. I especially liked the opening scene and the actor playing the professor. The murders are executed with lots of gusto as well. Again, I am just not a big fan of the Barbara Cartland-type romance between the Candyman and the girl amidst murder and mayhem. It just bores me. Nonetheless, Candyman 2 is a decent sequel in many regards. I think it will keep those that liked the first entertained, though they will more than likely enjoy the original far more.
