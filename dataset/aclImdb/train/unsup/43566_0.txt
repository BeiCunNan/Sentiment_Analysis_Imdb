I'd waited almost 30 years for this movie as a long time fan of the original series. What did I get, total drivel. I was really disappointed, when I heard that Stiller and Wilson were playing the lead roles, I would have preferred the original actors, even if they are both in their 60's. I'm sure the writers could have worked something out.<br /><br />I found the movie insulting to the original series. Todd Phillips should have known better, seeing that he worked on the show in the 70's.<br /><br />The best bit in the whole movie for me is the cameo appearance at the end by Glaser and Soul. Now that is definitely worth the wait.
