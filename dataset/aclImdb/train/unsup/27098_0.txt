It's right up there with another of my favorites, "Big Trouble in Little China"! It takes a certain kind of person to enjoy this movie: You have to be open minded and like to be entertained.<br /><br />I watch it every time it's on tv even though I own it on video. When I watched it for the first time, I thought I must have missed something. The movie seems to start in the middle of the story-like it's already on episode four. Which only makes it more fun!<br /><br />If you're looking for meaning-take a Philosophy class. If ya wanna be entertained and have some fun-watch Buckaroo Banzai(or Big Trouble).<br /><br />> I can't wait til they release this on DVD!!
