This movie is a piece of crap. Period. The lighting is awkward. There is one noticeable blooper in every scene. There are plot holes left and right. The acting is awful. The budget is noticeably low. And for all these reasons, it's extremely entertaining.<br /><br />Basically, the movie starts out with three women being arrested for (according to the Box description) "Crimes they didn't commit. After this, they are all sent to jail. All of these 'crimes' are just a form of self-defense, and would most likely result in a fine, at worst. To believe that a woman defending herself from an armed robber is worth jail time is laughable. In jail (which is constructed of an old elevator gate, and could be pushed over without effort) they all are released under the promise they find the killer of "Nitro Jones" (horribly played by Juvenille).Not surprisingly, he is in the movie for less than five minutes, yet gets the lead credit. Awesome. Following that is a period of awful fight scenes, terrible dialogue, and stereotypes.<br /><br />This movie is one of the worst movies ever made, but it's a must see for this reason.<br /><br />GOOFS: One of the girls call's the character "Baby Boy" by the actors name "Skip".<br /><br />When Nitro says "It's hot in here" and touches his shirt, you can hear heavy feedback from the mike.<br /><br />The tag-line is "Bad Girls with Big Guns". Only one of the girls actually holds a gun in this movie, and it is only to take it away from a bad guy.<br /><br />The cover is obviously photoshoped and one of the girls on the cover isn't even in the movie.<br /><br />Outside of Keefer's (a lawyers) office, you can easily see that a biohazard warning has been spray painted off the building.<br /><br />The Hooker in the prison with the Angel's asks if they have anything she can smoke that's "Not a cigarette". Obviously, they'd have search all of them for drugs, so this question is down right unbelievable.<br /><br />The Fight scenes are sped up so they can be performed slower in real life.
