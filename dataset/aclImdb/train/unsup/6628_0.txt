This sequel was simply AWLFUL. Although I didn't let it change my feelings on the first one. I just don't see what is the point of bringing out a second one when 1. the ending of he firsts one was fine like is or try more harder to make a sequel when you can get actually find the time to get the original people back and make it done right. No wonder Luke didn't want to do, because I bet he probably the same way, but just hold his thoughts through the whole thing. This movie didn't make any sense to me at all. Exactly what audience was this movie was suppose to direct this at. Because I don't see this movie directing towards anything but the garbage.<br /><br />There wasn't enough page and Eddie, their on screen chemistry sucked and Luke looked like he didn't want to be there at all. Soren as okay, the king and queen and page parents needed to go. IN Conclusion this movie as a big waste.
