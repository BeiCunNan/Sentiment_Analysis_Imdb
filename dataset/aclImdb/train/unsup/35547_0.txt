Memphis Belle is a run-of-the-mill war film, with few surprises and very little to offer in the way of excitement. The plot is a simple one- the crew have to complete their 25th mission to earn a flight home. There is minimal reference to the story of Memphis Belle in relation to the bigger picture ie World War II. The characters, introduced as fearless cocky airmen, remain underdeveloped throughout the film and it's little surprise that they return home as American heroes. While mindful of the contribution by Americans in the war to keep this country free, this film captures none of the fear or tension of flying a bomber on WWII. The characters are cardboard cut-out and the plot twists are as obvious as a B-52. If you are looking for a clean Hollywood introduction to WW11, this is your film. If however, you are over 12 years old and are looking for a more authentic and terrifying war movie, seek out Das Boot. A U-boat yes, and a German crew, but a masterclass in war film-making.
