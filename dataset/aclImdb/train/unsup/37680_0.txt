Not a true spoiler but does describe a scene late in the film.<br /><br />I registered for this service simply to express my amazement that films like this can find financing. The plot is clich√©d and ridiculous (a cop with a murdered wife and new partner, battling a vigilante?), there are numerous repetitive scenes, the characters are unsubtly written and generally highly unbelievable, and to top it off there is a clumsily-delivered religious message. Poor Mimi Rogers.<br /><br />Are we expected to believe the scene in the parking garage with the vigilante scuffling down the side? The escape is so unlikely but that is conveniently ignored because the plot requires the vigilante to get away.<br /><br />Last, it is difficult to imagine anyone unironically enjoying the song "Goodnight Erin" that plays through the credits. Utterly uncomfortable to watch/listen to. For friends of the film-maker only.
