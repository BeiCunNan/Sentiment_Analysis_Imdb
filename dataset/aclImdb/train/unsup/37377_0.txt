This goes to Marcos Lobato. This is an answer for "insights" There is no "discuss about" in English. You must say "discuss something" or "talk about something". And this movie is only nice photography, nothing else. They pick up an exclusive amateur duet of childish pop music siblings and tried to make them stars.<br /><br />There are nothing but didactic for kids. Brazilian movie industry still needs a lot of improvement concerning casting !!! Anyway, the lead characters cannot be rated good actors. That's all I think.<br /><br />That's my opinion folks. Thats it.<br /><br />There's no way it's over. Good Luck!!
