Cary Grant is one of my favorite actors, and this movie is his funniest ever, in my opinion. I had no idea, until seeing this film, that Irene Dunne was such a great comedienne. The script was excellent, even with great lines for Cecil Cunningham, who played Dunne's Aunt Patsy in the movie. The sight gag involving Grant attending a serious music recital, leaning back in a chair, and crashing to the floor was hilarious. I laughed out loud through most of the film, which must be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Grant's ability to express himself through his facial expressions is one of his best attributes, and this film allows him to do that frequently. I expect to watch this one fairly often.
