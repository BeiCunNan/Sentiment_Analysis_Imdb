Without a doubt this is Woody Allen's best effort. It is funny, has great pace, clever story line, and a surprise ending. In fact I can't think of anything I didn't like. Like all of Woody's films the photography, and sound are first rate, and as usual technically very good. It is a must see for any movie fan.
