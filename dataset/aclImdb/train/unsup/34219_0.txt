If you have time to waste, and I MEAN WASTE, then by all means this is the movie for you. The only half decent actress is the lead, Christina Campenella, the rest must have been hired from the unemployment line. The story seems to me an extremely low budget version of "The Shining" and takes place MOSTLY in a cheap motel room. A couple leave New York city to move in a half star motel room in Maine( for some reason, I just thought of the actors) so the guy ( Don Wood) can write his best selling novel, while his girlfriend works in a library. After they move in, strange things start happening. The feeble attempts to scare you are laughable, if not sad. Of course, the room number is 13, which must have required a great deal of thought for the writer to come up with something so original, and is haunted by a woman who had a relationship with a minister. This movie has a real crappy soundtrack that sounds like a propeller plane, which is really annoying! This film is true proof that they will put anything on DVD. The movie is written, produced and directed by the same guy, and believe me it shows. I can honestly say this is the worst movie, by far, I have ever seen. I have the movie on DVD, which in one way is a good thing, it's a perfect cure for my insomnia. This film is truly a horror, it's horrible! Take my word for it, don't pay to see this movie, they should pay you to see it!
