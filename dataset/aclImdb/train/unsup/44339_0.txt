Nothing here has been improved upon from the original the first remake, and if you've seen either, then this is completely unsatisfying. Of all the actors in it, Brenda Vaccaro is the only one I think anyone would rent or tune in to see, not that this does her or anyone else in the cast justice. There is not one moment that you won't be wishing you were watching the original.
