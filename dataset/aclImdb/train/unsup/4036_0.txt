Canadians are thirsty for stories that reflect and motivate us. Director Frances-Anne Solomon's recent offering A Winter Tale is just that kind of story... and more. Solomon and her cast deliver extraordinarily credible, emotionally raw and sincere performances that depict the vulnerability, self-preservation, and salvation of Toronto residents in the wake of gun violence. <br /><br />Set in Toronto's Parkdale community, the story opens with a social worker named Gene (played by Peter Williams) and his attempts to "get the black men in his community to talk", after an innocent 12-year old takes a fatal bullet meant for a drug dealer. The backdrop for much of the film is at the Caribbean Takeaway Restaurant run by Miss G (played by Leonie Forbes) where the men hang out drinking beers, speaking patois and playing cards and pool. <br /><br />The cast of A Winter Tale was "encouraged to bring a little piece of themselves" to every scene. This included their varied Caribbean and African backgrounds. Using an often overlooked technique, Solomon and her cousin, Michele Lonsdale-Smith (who directed the theater version of the movie) held improvisation workshops, where the actors could channel their characters freely. As a result, much of the cast is credited with helping to write the script. The cast also lived in Parkdale during the filming. <br /><br />On screen the group dynamics are riveting. The film is never stereotypical and never preachy. More importantly it's gripping and real, at times even nostalgic. We know these characters, not just on screen, but in our daily lives too. <br /><br />Each scene is ultimately a window into the tragedies, joys, and struggle with the negative elements in our society. The climax and resolution of the film leave you spent, unsure of what to feel next other than anxious, a little "mad", and exposed at the same time. Of the film, Solomon said she wanted to "pack an emotional punch". It does - violence is not a spectator sport, and nowhere in this film could you simply watch, - you felt the call to action and even discussion. No doubt before long, this film will be screening in theaters across Canada. <br /><br />Otherwise, you're missing out on one of the best truly Canadian films this year.
