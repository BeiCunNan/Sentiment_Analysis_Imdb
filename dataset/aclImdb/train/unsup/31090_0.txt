I first watched "The Dirtwater Dynasty" on Channel 7 with my father. We were both glued to the TV. I was really upset for the fact that I didn't tape it. However, my cousin had taped it and I remember one time watching it over and over again. My dad and I LOVED IT so much. After my dad had a stroke he lost a lot of his speech, but I remember my dad saying to me "Eastwick" and I knew he was talking about this mini-series... I so much want to buy a copy of "The Dirtwater Dynasty" on VHS or DVD for my father. I have called the Australian Television Association and requested numerous times to play it on TV so that I could record it, but I've had no luck.<br /><br />I wish it was for sale!!! A must see mini-series.
