"Pod people" is without a doubt, with no exception, the absolute worst movie I have ever seen. In fact, it is also without a doubt the worst movie EVER made. It makes "MANOS" look like a Disney movie comparison. Everything looks SO ugly in it, and when it's not ugly, it's foggy. Nothing is good about it at all, acting, directing, producing, all terrible. And this has got to have the worst score used in a film ever. 50's sci-fi films look like "Star Wars" in comparison to this tripe. "The Giant Spider Invasion" looks like "Close Encounters of the Third Kind". I hope I never see that red-haired, girly voiced brat again, or his loser family. I can see why they didn't care about him. What kind of lunatics would release this to America, it must be a conspiracy or something. I feel bad for the MST3K writers, to have to sit through this so many times. There must be at least 6 different stories happening at once, that includes the one going on during the credits (I think those are scenes from "The Galaxy Invader", using a bad movie for the credits of a bad movie, idiots). I HATE J.P. Simon, I don't care what other films he's directed, I'm surprised he could find work after directing this film. Geez, just think about how good, exciting, thought provoking films like "Metropolis" get chopped up so badly to the point of scenes being lost forever, and then released, yet films like this are still released in their original form. I hate this movie, and I want all the people involved with unleashing this on the public to know it.
