to all you people that thought this movie was a waste of money or had no potential then i guess you have a thing for movies like "she's all that'. this movie was very good in more ways than i care to type at the moment. some of you said that you wanted to watch it because of angelina jolie and antonio banderas as headliners. well maybe you've all learned your lessons, which would be dont judge a book by its cover. i happen to think that no other actors could have pulled this off. the plot was good but this movie couldnt have been the way it was if it wasnt for angelina jolie, antonio banderas, and thomas jane. they added much depth to their characters. i'm puzzled as to why it didnt do good at the boxoffice. i guess most of america just needs their she's all thats and maid in manhattens. well i gave this movie at 10/10. it really was great.
