I thought that the book was better then the movie. If the movie was more like that book i think that it would have been better. The movie had left out some details from the book that i think were pretty important. For example in the movie Rivka was Hannah's cousin and in the book Rivka was just a girl that Hannah had meet in the camp. Another thing is that in the book there was a few chapters on how they were stuck on the train for 4 days with out anything to drink or eat and in the movie the left out that whole part. That's why i think that the book was a lot better then the movie. I think that if they had made the movie just like the book it would have been a lot better.
