<br /><br />A great film for those who admire film maverick Sam Fuller. Fuller, the director of cult and critical classics such as SHOCK CORRIDOR and THE NAKED KISS, appears in this film in his biggest role as a cigar-chewing Nazi hunter who turns to hunting down vamps. This is one of the great late appearances of Fuller and thus must be considered valuable for film history. And he has great lines such as "I'm not a Nazi hunter. I'm a Nazi KILLER!" Viva Fuller!!!!
