Years ago when this aired on Baton Rouge's WLPB PBS station it was HEAVILY edited! <br /><br />Only after someone reminded me that it was being re-shown on WYES in New Orleans UNCUT I eagerly tuned in! <br /><br />Totally changed the entire direction of the movie! I don't think stations should be allowed to run cut movies. <br /><br />Show it at a later time but don't hack up good movies, especially a classic just for someones Puritanical nonsense! <br /><br />Have to say...even cut up as it was the first time I saw it, it was still a 10.
