There is no good reason for this film to get anything below a 7.5. I have loved this film since my childhood, and recently was on the verge of tears during one particular scene.<br /><br />Perhaps people just don't know what to make of this movie... and they critize it as being kiddie and trite and whatnot... its a KID's MOVIE, for God's sake! Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams are great in their characterization of Hook and Pan. The beginning of the movie builds great tension with the "After-the-fact" kidnapping - the hook slashes down the hallway build up great suspense. Just...MAN THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!<br /><br />Like I said before, just pretend this movie is rated "7.5" and go RENT IT! You will love it! Just don't except an all out Spielberg masterpiece, you might be just a little (yes, maybe just a little) disappointed. Otherwise, SIT BACK, ENJOY, and say FU to all the idiots who gave this movie a low rating.
