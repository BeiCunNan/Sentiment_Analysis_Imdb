Casper Van Dien is one of the worst actors I've seen in movies today, but he is particular bad in this terrible shark movie which is completely devoid of good action, horror, and fun. If you are looking for a shark movie without much of a plot but with fun moments, check out DEEP BLUE SEA (7/10), the more expensive and superior shark movie that came out the same year, but do not watch SHARK ATTACK.<br /><br />3/10
