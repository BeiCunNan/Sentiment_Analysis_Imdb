I have to say, whoever wrote the comment "Oh My God" made a very valid point, where is the title character?! That aside, it is a bit of a light chuckle, but I found myself screaming at the TV more than anything!! Most definitely filmed in England, with a largely British cast. But the home of the main character is most definitely NOT English, despite being in a very English location. The film is packed with things that the American creators obviously thought they were getting totally right, but have got COMPLETELY wrong!! Ridiculous British stereotypes, the types of people whom I have never come across in my 20 years of living; an Irish stereotype; the obvious Asian-American stereotype; American phrases; American cultural references; ridiculous British references that are.. well they're not really anything that anyone in Britain would actually make any form of reference to!! So on and so forth!! Overall, a laugh, but not worth the frustration of being an American made, British based film!!
