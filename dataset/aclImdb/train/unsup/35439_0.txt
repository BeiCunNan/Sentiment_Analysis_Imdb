It's so easy, isn't it, to use the camera to do whatever you want, even if it is never more than anything else than a shaggy dog story. You can take an actress who's playing a person already dead, and stick her in front of the camera and use somebody else's voice. The bottom line is that the two major events of this film, 1) that Alain would accept Alice's overtures as far as he did, and 2) that they would not only stay in the house but leave the bloody stain on the wall, these two events ruin the film. Up to the first half hour it's great. I have clear ideas how to fix it up, but my ideas don't matter because I don't get to re-film it.
