The title sound perfect but there where the things ends.The fact that the stunts seems to made up by some 5 year old coordinator and the dialog is so predictive and boring that you can see the final sequence of the movie. My god, what the director and the whole crew members where thinking when they ware shooting the sequence when the main actor shoots at the two Koreans from 2 meters and runs out of bullet after depleting the gun trows at them with the pistol and hit one in the face.Come on guys even a 3 year kid will not buy something like that. Is so pathetic that not worth watching until the end really. How hard is to make something good when the budget doesn't allow it.
