Feestje! has all the characteristics of a bad Dutch movie: it's main actor is a 38 year old playing a student, there's meaningless, unfunctional sex in it and the story doesn't make any sense. You can have worse times though...<br /><br />Ruud van Hemert brought his dynamic duo from his previous flop, 'Ik Ook Van Jou' back into this one, and I must say that Van Erven Dorens is likable in his role, although one can tell it's not acting which he does for a living. Kamerling meanwhile isn't the actor a lot of people once thought he would be, and picking roles like this one won't help either.<br /><br />The story: Ben (Van Erven Dorens) is about to marry Talita (Chantal Janzen), and is been bragging to her parents about his best friend and best man Thijs (Kamerling). He does this so well they want him to plan the weddingparty. While Thijs really is a sloppy student only believing in one night stands and hating couples and marriage...<br /><br />Things complicate when social worker Susan (Daphne Bunskoek) steps into his life and he wants to start off his own bar/restaurant...<br /><br />The movie at times is extremely messy (watch the scene where Thijs and Susan are in the kitchen at night, talking. It seems that in every shot they are standing in another part of the kitchen) and the acting, as said before, is only so and so. Still, I had an OK time with it what couldn't be said about Ik Ook Van Jou.<br /><br />PS If you're a big Chantal Janzen fan, you can skip this one as she has about 1 line in it.<br /><br />4/10.
