I gotta say, I really dug this one. A little different take on the whole "cannibal" genre - this one plays out more like a zombie film, except the "monsters" aren't dead - they're just humans with a kind of "cannibal rabies"...<br /><br />Two men are brought back from Vietnam and are kept in a mental institution due to their unhealthy appetite for human flesh. It seems that since that is all they had to eat at times, they were somehow "infected" with a need to continue with this bad habit. It also seems that this "virus" can be transmitted by the bite of an "infected" person. When one of the patients causes quite a fuss on one of his unsupervised leaves from the hospital, his old commanding officer shows up to help diffuse the situation. Unfortunately, years before, the commanding officer was also bitten while trying to rescue these poor soldiers, but has been pretty good at keeping his "sickness" at bay. Things get out of hand and start "spreading" when the patients attack members of the hospital staff and begin transmitting the cannibal virus...<br /><br />CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE is a really entertaining and somewhat novel spin to the over-done cannibal genre. Taking the concept out of the jungle and mixing it with a zombie-like infection approach makes this one an original and enjoyable film. Plenty of red-stuff for the goreheads out there, and the fast-pace keeps it interesting and entertaining. Also, the police chief has some great one-liners - keep an ear out for him as well. Definitely worth a look for cannibal/zombie/gore fans...8.5/10
