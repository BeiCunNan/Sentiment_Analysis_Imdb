This film, originally titled Outer Touch but now called by its American title, Spaced Out, is getting a bit of a cult following though why this should be is a bit of a mystery because it isn't really that good. It is written in the style of the British "Confessions" films but without the panache. The sets were left-overs from another film and bits from Space 1999 were spliced in. The humour is distinctly British low-brow with the expected sexual innuendos.<br /><br />Three gorgeous female aliens crash-land on Earth and take four (three male and one female) prisoners. Never having seen men before, it's not long before the men are subject to intense scrutiny and testing. How is it that this alien species which has never experienced men have all the female bits that men lust after? Charles Darwin has a lot of explaining to do. Of course, in typical sex comedy style, once they experience earthmen, they can't get enough of it.<br /><br />There are some good moments in this film such as Glory Annen examining Tony Maiden, and Ava Cadell testing Michael Rowlatt. Barry Stokes is like Clark Kent but without the charisma. The voice of the Wurlitzer was changed for the American market as well as the music. The ending for the American version was also changed. Compared to the US VHS, the US Region 1 DVD (both R-rated) has been panned and scanned to cut out some of the flesh. For the UK DVD, the film (double-billed with Sex Clinic) looks to be the original British version.
