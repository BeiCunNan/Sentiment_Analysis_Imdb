I have seen this movie and I thought that it was good. Because it shows us how hard life would be if Mexicans were not in the United States. That is what is trying to show. It isn't saying that the Mexicans are going to disappear, but it is trying to show how life would be without them. I have only seen it once. But I would like to own it.I know the movie isn't for everyone. I liked it and I just wish people would watch it. because if they watched it they would see how hard life would be if Mexicans would not be here in the US. If you want to talk more about it just e-mail me.... mexican_soccer_chica_20@hotmail.com. I had never heard of the movie until I went to go rent some movies. I found it, rented it and watched it. At first I was confused but then I figured out what was going on.... So please just give the movie a chance.
