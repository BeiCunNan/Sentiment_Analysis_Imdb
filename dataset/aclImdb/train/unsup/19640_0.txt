This film is puree of heist movies: the Comic Heist (Ocean's Eleven), the Sexy Heist (The Thomas Crown Affair), the One Last Heist (The Score), and the "Gee, I Kinda Like the Guy I'm Chasing/Being Chased By " Heist (Heat). The result is a bland time-waster. Salma Hayek is gorgeous (duh!) but she and Pierce Brosnan have zero chemistry. Brosnan's relationship with Woody Harrelson has some good moments, but gets scuttled by heavyhanded are-they-gay? jokes that play like the first draft of a "Will and Grace" episode. Don Cheadle's talents are wasted in a thankless role as the villain--just when you've forgotten he's even IN the movie, he turns up again to bring the film to a halt. I kept waiting for one great plot twist, but every would-be Big Shock is telegraphed far in advance. As a caper film, this is petty larceny.
