Yes, the monster is most definitely from the original Pumpkinhead movie. There is even an old lady that resembles the old lady from the first movie as well. Of course, our old friend revenge is also along for the ride, however the parts where one gets revenge by unburying Pumpkinhead and such is gone. It is a new world with new rules and such for our monster to abide by. It also features lots of obvious stuff as there are no startling revelations to be had here, just all the stuff one expects from this type of movie. So yes, the plot here is pretty basic, some wrong has been committed and the Pumpkinhead monster is going to kill those directly and indirectly responsible for said wrong. I would go into more details, but I would not want to spoil the movie for you. However, if you hated Punky Brewster as a child or even if you were an adult there is a scene in this movie that is sure to delight you! So all in all not a boring movie, it is watchable, just do not expect to much. Basically, anything that was good about the first Pumpkinhead movie is now taken out so you can be amazed out how simple the plot is and how uninspired.
