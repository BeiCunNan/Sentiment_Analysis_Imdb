Theodore Tugboat is a show based on a bunch of tugboats that work in a harbor. I don't know about you, but that never seemed to entertain me for a half hour (then again, when you have no cable and you live off of video tapes as a little kid in the 90s, what can you do?) and really, i have no idea what it was doing on CBC for 7 years.<br /><br />OK, the Episode starts out with the harbor master, usually doing something and running into a problem. he then tells a story, hoping to solve his problem, and at the end of the episode, always solves his problem.<br /><br />His stories are all about the tugboats having their own problems and solving them. but the problems are so simple, it's pretty lame to say the least. on one episode, Theodore's engine screwed up and he could only go backwards, until he went to go get fixed. parallel to the problem, the harbor master cut himself while playing the tuba (how can you cut yourself playing a tuba?) and the solution? a band-aid. how many kids who are 3 know that they can go get a band-aid if they're cut? probably 19 out of 20 kids know that. aside from that, the theme song was also quickly slapped together, many of the lyrics were much like many children's shows, not rhyming, but sugar-coated and sweet.<br /><br />Even if you are a kid, this show will get boring within a few minutes. it's not on anymore that i know of, so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
