This was the worst adaption of Hamlet I have ever seen. Ehtan Hawke's pseudo-intellectual persona is tired. During some scenes, it appeared that he was reading off of cue cards. Tim Conway would have made a more believable Hamlet. This attempt to put a contemporary spin on a classic was presumptuous and poorly implemented. The Kenneth Brannaugh version is much more worthy of your time.<br /><br />
