I think that this picture is the finest war story since I saw Saving Private Ryan. Clint Eastwood has outdone himself with this realistic portrayal of the fight in the Pacific in World War 11, There is no outstanding cast in the movie but all the characters did a fine job with their parts. The photograph of the Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima is well know to most all of us, but the story surrounding the photograph was not as well know. Thanks to Mr Clint Eastwood's fine directing the facts are now spread before us. The actor who played the Indian was outstanding in his part and we should see more of him in the future. I am sorry that I do not know his name but he filled the part with a lot of feeling. If you like war stories, please don't miss this movie and you will be missing a winner!!!!
