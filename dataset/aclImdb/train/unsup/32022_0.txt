A desolate army outpost near Lebanon is the setting for this tale of intimate relations in "Yossi & Jagger." The viewer has a rare opportunity to spend time with a small battery of Israeli soldiers preparing for an ambush.<br /><br />Eytan Fox's direction is comparable to another Hebraic effort, Amos Guttman's "Hessed Mufla" (1992) in its subtle yet realistic depictions. The characters of both convey genuine emotions and actions, while copious close ups enhance the stories' intimate natures.<br /><br />Yael Avivo as Yossi is subdued and caring. Yehuda Levi (who somewhat resembles young Alain Delon) as Jagger is restrained and sensitive.<br /><br />Running at a brief 65 minutes, the film makes its points without much elaboration. Titles often appear quickly, requiring some fast reading on part of the viewer.
