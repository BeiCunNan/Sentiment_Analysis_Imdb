Regrettably, this is one of the worst noir films I've seen. Robert Montgomery as a hard-boiled Philip Marlowe? C'mon. His accent alone is pathetic. Luckily, with the POV technique, we don't have to see him, since he looks even less authentic. As for the supposedly wonderful, pungent prose of Raymond Chandler--it's laughable. There are so many wonderful noir films--Double Indemnity, Out of the Past, Woman in the Window, Shadow of a Doubt, etc--it's a shame this is around to drag down the genre. Sorry.
