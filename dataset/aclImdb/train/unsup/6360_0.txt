I'm not sure how many words the IMDb allows viewers to prattle on in their reviews, but whatever that word limit is, it is not enough by 1/10th to adequately describe the awfulness that is Al Adamson's "Dracula vs. Frankenstein." It's hard to decide where to begin even; every aspect of this picture is so singularly wretched. Howzabout the acting, for starters? When Regina Carrol turns out to be the most accomplished thespian in a film, you know you're in for a rough ride! J. Carrol Naish (the other Carrol in the picture) stars as the wheelchair-bound Dr. Frankenstein, masquerading as the owner of a carnival freak show. He is involved, along with mute idiot Lon Chaney, Jr., in experiments involving the decapitation of young women in order to procure a special type of fright-induced blood. (Don't worry...it didn't make much sense to me either.) This was both Naish's and Chaney's final film; what a sad way to go out. Naish looks terrible, and performs as if he were on the edge of senility. Chaney has no lines whatsoever, and merely stands around slavering and acting like a dodo. A ridiculous-looking Dracula pops up, wearing more painted-on facial hair than Groucho, and convinces the good Dr. to dig up the old Frankenstein monster, which turns out to have a face like a mass of festering mushrooms. Russ Tamblyn gets thrown into the mix as well, playing a nasty biker. From the heights of "West Side Story" in '61 to this "West Coast Gory" in '71; he should have killed his agent! So we have, in this film, horrible, borderline embarrassing acting; a ridiculous story that makes little to no sense whatsoever; Regina getting dosed with LSD and flouncing around a biker bar; atrocious lighting; inept direction; god-awful effects; AND a horrendous musical number or two. Is it any wonder that this picture is considered a camp classic? Besides one or two good screams from Regina and an atmospheric woods walk, this picture offers little besides the camp.
