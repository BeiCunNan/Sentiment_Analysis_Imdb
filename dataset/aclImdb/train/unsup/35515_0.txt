I've seen quite a few episodes of Penn & Teller's show. And I have to say it's terrible. In more ways than one. It poses as an informative show and tries to show or disprove what they think is bullshit without REALLY looking at the evidence. They have the habit of bringing in 1-2 EXPERTS who are completely on their side...and then they bring in 2-3 morons who poorly represent the other side.<br /><br />If you want your decisions made for you by stage magicians, this is the show for you. If not, I recommend you open up your mind and do some ACTUAL research. And if you're intellectually honest with yourself you may get some REAL answers.<br /><br />Penn, Teller, keep your magic tricks on the stage pretty please.
