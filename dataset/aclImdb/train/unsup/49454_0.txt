MIMIC 3 (spoilers) is one of the worst movies ever made. The main character (Geary) is someone who supposedly has severe allergies and lives in a sealed off room. However, when it suits the movie, the same guy is walking around in the alleys of the Bronx. Geary plays his character like an early 1950s Jerry Lewis with all the nervous ticks and funny walks that he must have thought come with allergies. Watching Geary constantly twitching and having spastic attacks makes the movie more enjoyable than it should be. Geary spends most of his time in his room taking photos of his neighbors at the apartment house across the street. Apparently none of his neighbors have heard of vertical blinds or window shades, and so they are all walking around naked, arguing, fighting, painting, etc. for the amusement of Geary who is taking photos of these folks (even at night, and without a flash). Even the Cockroach Monster has an apartment, though the issue is never addressed as to how he pays the rent, what bank opened a checking account for Mr. Roach, and how he signed the lease. At some point people start disappearing from the apartments, and Geary starts to see Mr. Roach killing some of them from his window. That is about as exciting as this movie gets. Amanda Plummer plays the mother of Jerry Lewis-Geary, and there is not much of a point to her role in the film. Lance Henrikson was in this movie for about five minutes of some really bad acting. Apparently he needed the money. The ending of this film is pathetic. It has been done in dozens of other movies, Jerry Lewis Geary gets into the refrigerator while the oxygen tanks in his house blow up all the roaches. Geary's girlfriend, who he left outside the refrigerator is not injured either, and his sister, who was sliced and diced by the Roaches (there is more than one BIG ROACH) miraculously pulls through. MIMIC 3 is so bad that the fact that any of the human characters survived just added to how bad this movie was.
