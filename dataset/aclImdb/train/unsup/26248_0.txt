I simply love this film. The five main characters are just gorgeous. Sure this movie is badly acted, but its lots and lots of fun. Rent it and you'll see how the director exploits the babes' bodies. IT HAS LOTS of nudity, some blood, barely dressed chicks shooting each other, a lot of screaming and a really high sense of fun. I am proud to say I own a copy of this film and its one of my favorite slasher movies from the 90's.
