The greatest thing about this movie is that on the back of the DVD case, it states that it will go down as a cult classic rivaling the fame of the Rocky Horror Picture Show.<br /><br />I stumbled upon this movie when a friend was going to throw out an electric guitar of his and decided to give it to me. I didn't feel right just taking it without giving him anything in return, so, being the modest person that he was, he told me simply to buy this movie for him as he had noticed it at Suncoast a few days earlier. Being a fan of zombie movies I, of course, was compelled by my own curiosity to watch it. I now see why he wanted to own it.<br /><br />Every line of dubbed dialogue is the most unintentionally humorous thing you will ever hear. The zombies wore masks, instead of makeup, that were covered in maggots that strangely made them look even worse than the zombies in Zombie Lake and a bit like Tusken Raiders. As if that weren't enough, they were also skilled in the art of using gardening utensils as weapons. They even have a scene where one zombie hands out said utensils to the other zombies, a la every ancient war movie you've ever seen. Lastly, who could forget the stunning man-boy with a Norman Bates complex? <br /><br />Do yourself a favor, and at least rent this movie. It deserves to be seen by everyone at least once in their lifetime.
