Although the movie was pretty lame, with all honesty, it was a nice change for a new storyline. Unlike those typical teen movies with partying and some fruitless high school teens, this movie.. well, it didn't have substance, but it had a "nice" attempt. The movie went by pretty quick, though it repeated many of its sequences. I, however, was only glued to the tube because of my favorite actors, Dominique Swain and Oliver Hudson. The actors, well, most of them looked good, and that's a bonus for the film's empty significance.
