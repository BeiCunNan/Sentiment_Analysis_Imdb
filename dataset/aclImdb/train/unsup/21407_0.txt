A memorable movie for the wrong reasons. The first time I watched "Angus" I thought : "what a great movie! it will be among my favorites!". Now, every time it airs on cable I try to avoid it. But don't get me wrong, I avoid it not because it's a boring or bad movie, it's that it provokes me mixed feelings. There are many comedic moments that suddenly crash with dramatic situations that could make anyone cry. I mean, the warming relationship between Angus and his grandpa is tear jerker (specially before grandpa dies), but then it picks up the teenager situations.<br /><br />Angus is a story about a boy that suffers from being bullied, betrayed by his ONLY geeky friend, and then loses the most important person in his life : his grand father.<br /><br />Now, this is an entertaining movie but it carries some difficult situations like bullying, death, loneliness, etc.<br /><br />Recommended.
