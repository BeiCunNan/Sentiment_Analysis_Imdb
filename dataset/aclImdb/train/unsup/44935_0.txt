Get a guy from somewhere, call him a director and tell him to make some astounding rubbish. As it's going to be absolute tat you might as well try to make it controversial. Oh, and there's no budget either so it's gonna look cheap. Yep, it's gonna be something like an English version of Cabin Fever. The film is appalling on every level. The old clich√© of 'you'll never get back the 90 minutes of your life' applies here. Only 15-18 year old's will rate this movie, as it's aimed at them. Really, really bad.
