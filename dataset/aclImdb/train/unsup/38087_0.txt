After seeing this movie, I came to ask myself why this movie was called Bloody Mary. Besides them showing how she died and her getting revenge on the people that hurt her, by killing their kids, nothing else has to do with the story of Bloody Mary. The majority of the movie is people being killed one right after the other. They needed to go into more depth about Mary. Also instead of them saying Bloody Mary in a well lighted room, they should have done it in the bathroom with the lights turned off and facing the mirror, the way it's suppose to go. I have heard many versions of the story, but I'm pretty sure she was suppose to be pregnant....<br /><br />OK so at the end we find out that Billy was the kids stepfather, wow big surprise, who killed Mary by accident. So he goes and tries to kill the brother and sister. We see the brother die, but at the end the sister doesn't even look sad. I have heard that they cut out the part when they run into each other at the hospital. Why would they do that? It kind of makes the ending look stupid.<br /><br />Anyways it's kind of cool the way that the people die but nothing's a mystery. You know what's going to happen before it happens. If you're extremely bored and there's nothing else to watch I suggest this to waste some time before a show comes on.
