I can't believe this is compared to Todd Brownings Freaks! Sure the storyline holds some similarities but thats it. A terrible long drawn out movie, with a feeble attempt at a plot. Bad acting, bad special effects, just a all around bad movie. I couldn't wait for the credits to roll up the screen. If "C" movies exist then this would make the "D" category. The acting is so bad in this movie, that it makes you work double time on trying to follow the really horrible plot. The ending is the worst I have ever had to be put through in one sitting, when the girl has to be remade to fit into the "Family" for betraying them. The longest "meat fest" in film history,People we get the picture, you don't have to show the family hacking away at this girl for 10 minutes for us to understand what is going on. Please lock this movie away in a lead sealed vault, weld the hinges and bury it 300 feet deep within the bowels of the Earths surface, and please,please,please....Never direct another film as long as you live.
