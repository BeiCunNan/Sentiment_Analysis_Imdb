- During an initiation ceremony, a girl is accidentally shot to death. At least it appeared to be an accident. Her father doesn't think so. Seven years later, he sends anonymous invitations to the other girls to gather for a reunion. His plan is to find the girl responsible for his daughters murder and kill her. If some of the other girls die along the way, it's of no concern to him.<br /><br />- Sisters of Death is a typical low-budget horror film from the 70s. I've read that it was actually made in 1972(?), but not released until 1978. I don't know why, just thought it was an interesting fact. Bad acting and a ridiculous plot are the "highlights".<br /><br />- There are several examples I could mention as problems within this movie. But, I'll just note two small scenes that left me scratching my head. 1. The girls know that there is a madman loose in the house. They've even met him. Yet, when it comes time to get some sleep, they all go to their separate bedrooms. If you knew someone in the house wanted to kill you, wouldn't you want to remain as a group? 2. Toward the end of the movie, a dog suddenly comes bolting out of the house and attacks one of the guys in the group. Where did this dog come from? Did he suddenly materialize out of thin air? And, after he pushes the guy into the electric fence, where does the dog go and why doesn't he attack anyone else? These are just two of the mysteries of life.<br /><br />- Sisters of Death features Joe E. Tata who, I understand, appeared on Beverly Hills 90210.
