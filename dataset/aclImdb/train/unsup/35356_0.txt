Tragic yes if you look at what happened, but like many documentations made for TV, this one fails miserably. The plot is based loosely on the actual case by what was shown, using the most catchy of scenes and then over-glorifying them. The acting, atrocious. Pin the blame on the bumbling cops who are trying to solve this murder. Are they really cops? The guilty couple who committed the crime was okay, but suffers the same glorifying effect. It doesn't make them tragic, it makes them inane. Bottom line, not a very good drama. 4 / 10
