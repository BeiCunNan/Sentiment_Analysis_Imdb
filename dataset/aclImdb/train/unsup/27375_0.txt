I think that the previous reviews I read on this site must've come from friends and relatives (or paid shills) of this horrifically bad movie. <br /><br />The producers of this dung heap probably had the great idea to load up the initial pages with fake positive reviews (no one who knows squat about film making could entertain giving this more than 1 star) therefore, all the negative reviews are towards the last few pages. Their hope was that people will just scan the first few pages of these suck up commentaries and proceed to pay their money and get ripped off. The movie was so poorly acted, that it was hard to take just from that fact alone. The girl who played the reporter was especially annoying. I've never seen such a petulant puss before. Following this serial killer guy around like a desperate puppy. BTW, the serial killer has the physique of Pee Wee Herman. But, the funniest aspect of this movie was the fact that these actors seemed to take their roles so seriously and spewed some really awful dialog. The entire movie had an "Intro. to Movie Making" feel to it, as if this film was made as a class project. Shot digitally, with a hand held camera to give the viewer a feeling of "real time," this technique failed miserably (unlike a well done movie such as Cloverfield.) With soap opera production values, this expose of a serial killer just tanks and will leave you with that "I just wasted my money" feeling.
