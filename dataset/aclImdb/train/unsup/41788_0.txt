seriously nobody is doing to the Mexican film industry any good by calling this film a classic, because by telling that, it means that this is the better that Mexican directors can do.<br /><br />I tell this because this movie is truly horrible, the acting, the ambiance, even the music it's like a nightmare to the ears. I beg to people from Mexico to be objective, this movie is trash, and it isn't deserve to call it classic, and to say the contrary is an insult for the cinematographic industry of Mexico.<br /><br />One of the dullest film I've seen in all my life. <br /><br />I give 1 out of 10
