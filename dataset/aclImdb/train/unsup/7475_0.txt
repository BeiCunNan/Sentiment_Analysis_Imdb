i had really low expectation going in.mainly because of the words MTV films appearing on the screen was surprised at how well done this psychological suspense thriller was.i found it very atmospheric,and suspenseful.there weren't a lot of cheap scares.it was intelligent,and well written,in my opinion.the ending was unexpected.i was also very impressed with the acting.Nora Zehetner as Christy was very good,but Matthew Settle as John really impressed.basically,my opinion of MTV films went up several notches after this film was over.i don't get the low rating(5.3/10).but that's just my opinion.for me,Beneath is a well deserved 8/10
