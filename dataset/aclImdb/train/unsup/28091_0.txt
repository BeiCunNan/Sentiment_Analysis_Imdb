I found Ca Twiste to be very interesting. It's not that it was profound or prolific... It was just because I am an outsider looking in. These young-ones were Africans, as pure as can be, (given the fact that they've been colonized) and I'm a little all American "tom-boy;" "Jack and Dianne in the American heartland" rolled into one person. Do these people and I actually have something in common? I guess we do. We all have to live, learn, and grow, even if we are half-a-world-apart. But I digress, the movie is what is important, I supposed. It's sad really, or at least pathetic. For the first time in goodness knows how longÂ… I crave an American Hollywood-style ending. But Hollywood can't do anything right in my opinion.<br /><br />I'm just going to get right to it. The ending was- upsetting. I wanted more. The film just ends with the two children under the table making a reference to Ivanhoe that was lost on me. (Perhaps, if I had ever read that book, I could have understood it.) Thankfully, someone was there to explain it to me. The fighting between the quarrelsome children was over not because anything had been settled, but because they were sick of fighting. The voice over during the credits tells you how the kids grew up to love, laugh, and live elsewhere. That's how it ends: nice, pure, and simple.<br /><br />The voice over was the most meaningful part to me; it served as a reminder that we are being given a glimpse into a real somebody's personal life, and it should be treated with a form of respect and reverence akin to what one would give someone else's diary. This is why I don't have the heart to pick it apart like a normal critique would.
