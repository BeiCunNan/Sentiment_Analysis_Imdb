Without being driven by my emotions for SRK(whom I really admire), I think Saawariya is a much much better movie than OSO - I hate comparing them but that seems to be the way people want to judge it.Saawariya is definitely SLB's best work , is breathtakingly beautiful and has wonderful acting which confuses me because inspite of all this it tends to get boring.<br /><br />It is a love story about an effervescent,full of life Ranbir and a serene,sad Sonam waiting for her lover to return.Meanwhile the two strike a friendship - but one of them expects more from it which makes for the rest of the movie. The movie has some great music and a few brilliant scenes but there are scenes that simply annoyed me.I couldn't make sense of it,the dialogues were pathetic(ex the Lilypop-Ranbir scenes) etc.Also the fact that the movie doesn't find grounding in reality - we don't know the place or time may not appeal to people who are not much into love stories and music.<br /><br />Ranbir Kapoor is awesome.He has a charm and a skill (a Lee Strasberg product)that makes us want to see more of him.Sonam is brilliant inspite of having such a weakly written character that you feel like loving and hating as well.Rani is a show stealer but her significance to the plot is questionable and Salman is just there!<br /><br />My advice would be don't watch either OSO or Saawariya - wait for a DVD to come out.Instead go check out Jab We Met which is definitely the best movie to come out this year.
