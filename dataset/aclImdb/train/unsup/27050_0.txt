This is a fairly tight little thriller, a good but not quite good enough film noir to be counted among the classics. While it owes a lot to "Double Indemnity" and foreshadows "Rear Window," it just doesn't rise to their memorable level. Fred MacMurray offers an eerily familiar, though less inspired, repeat of his performance in the Wilder classic; Kim Novak (in her first film) is no match for Stanwyck, nor did she ever become one; Richard Quine simply was not as fine a director as Hitchcock or Wilder. And yet, it's a pretty good bit of entertainment, recommended to those who appreciate the genre as a whole rather than merely a short list of classics.
