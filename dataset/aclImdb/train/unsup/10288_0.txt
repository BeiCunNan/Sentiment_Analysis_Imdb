I think that The Flying Doctors are one of the best TV-Series to date. I'm only 17 years old, but I've seen the series twice already. They are showing re-runs here in Sweden now again, and I can't be happier! It's a fantastic series, Kate and Geoff are really wonderful, and all the personalities in the show's just amazing! I really love this! I just wish that Crawford Productions, or whatever it is, would distribute DVD, or VHS of the complete series. I've looked everywhere on the internet, but I haven't found anything! Anyone who knows where I can purchase anything? Anyway, the series is awesome and I hope they'll never stop showing it!
