Best show ever. the characters are awesome. my favorites are Cassie the witch and Thelma the lesbian ghost. but Azazel is hot. watch it because it would be like nothing you've ever seen before. who ever came up with the idea is a genius. the chemistry between characters it fantastic. you might recognize Cassie from "what a girl wants", this is a major step up for her and she is a great actor and should get more offers after this show. Thelma is also not a new face, she was is in the famous five movies. as the tom-boy George (georgina).its nice to see her with a change of clothes and looking more like a girl. Azazel is a hunk of gorgeous man. he is the fallen angel who is working with the devil against god. this show has a brilliant plot and I'm gonna keep watching
