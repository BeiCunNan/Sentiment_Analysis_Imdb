The movie "Contagion" was better than I thought it would be. At first before the movie started I had the feeling it would be cheesy like a horrible Sci-Fi movie. The quality of acting in this movie was not of the best of quality, the only actor's face who I knew was the dad's from the television series "Wonder Years." The actors did not say their lines with the "realness" that they should have. There were a lot of holes in the movie, for example with the president's family. They didn't exactly speculate what happened with his wife and they talked a lot about the son, but we never saw him or heard anything about him. The believability of the storyline was alright with the virus spreading through the hospital by it being airborne made somewhat sense. The ending was annoying, first with her cutting only one of the straps on the tunnel and it expanding and then when she made the last second phone call. All in all this is a movie that you watch during a boring weekend to go to sleep.
