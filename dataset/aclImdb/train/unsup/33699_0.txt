i love the book. i love the work of many of the people involved in this film. i HATE what they came up with here, knowing the deep fabric of text available! <br /><br />if you've read the book, think how this could've been a mostly-live-action fantasy/horror/comedy flick. there was gorgeous potential! i<br /><br />imagine tall, gossamer deeply creepy "cloud people" and a sense of doom and dread as the peach approached them! imagine the shiny, clickety, reality of centipede in contrast to his songs in the original text! this film could have gone much more "adult" in the atmospherically eerie factor and been at least ten times better for it!<br /><br />uhgg, i see the images of this book -glorious, and a bit creepy, in my mind -if i had money i'd make the film- but this is a cheesy and limited version of what it could be.
