InuYasha is an excellent anime series with everything a good TV series needs. Its got action, suspense, comedy and love. Inuyasha is about the adventures of a young half-demon from futile Japan and a human girl from modern times. <br /><br />They team up with a monk and a demon slayer to find sacred jewel shards and destroy an evil demon. The animation is really good. What you have to remember is this is a TV series and not a movie. TV series never look as good as movies. I've seen some bad animation and this is NOT one of them. <br /><br />The music is great and the voice actors fit the characters perfectly. All-Around : great show with few (if any) flaws. Any anime fan who loves fantasy will adore this show.
