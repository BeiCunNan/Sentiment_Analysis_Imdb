Many people already wrote the plots of "Lust, Caution". I don't repeat again, I just have a few words here...<br /><br />I have read many reviews from the professional film critics. Some are extremely insulting, and those people didn't understand the film at all. I felt sorry for Ang Lee and all people who worked hard for the film.<br /><br />"Lust, Caution" is a pure Chinese drama with the bloody China-Japan war and the Chinese cultural context of 1940s: slow pace, old Shanghai, mahjong, the traditional song, hatred, love, loneliness, and the souls of students and traitors.<br /><br />Do not forget the cultural differences: Western people play the card games; Chinese people play the mahjong games. I don't know either, I always see the body languages of the players.<br /><br />I personally dislike the raw sexual scenes, however, the film is still a masterpiece!
