My favourite film of all time!<br /><br />This was a film that I saw by complete accident, browsing Foxtel one day & caught it 10 minutes in. Even though I'd missed a few things crucial to the plot, there were plenty of other elements to this film that kept me watching.<br /><br />For starters, the acting performance by Paul Bettany is complete brilliance. His portrayal of a psychopathic gangster is unbelievable, if not sometimes a little scary.<br /><br />Malcolm McDowell plays Gangster 55 with coolness that young others just don't have. A suave that only actors with his many accomplishments can carry.<br /><br />David Thewlis is awesome as Freddie Mays, the coolest gangster in film history! Flawless performance.<br /><br />In fact, the acting in this film is flawless all round, there are no weak performances.<br /><br />As somebody that has never experienced the 60's, I found all of the scenes that took place in that era completely believable, a very romantic idea for what the London underworld would have been like.<br /><br />An unreal film.
