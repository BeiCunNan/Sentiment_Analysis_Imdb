Doc Hollywood is one of my most favorite films that I don't mind watching over and over. Perhaps it is because it is so well written, has outstanding actors, or that I recognize the realistic characters and one street Southern town it is based on, Micanopy, FL, having lived in nearby Gainesville. Michael J. Fox has never made a bad movie and I've always admired his enthusiastic characters. Julie Warner is a good match for him in looks and talent. I can't believe she isn't a bigger star by now. Merrill Streep and Rene Zellwigger have nothing on her and she is far better looking than either. They must have better agents. Julie's recent recurring character in Nip Tuck gave an Emmy Award performance every week and stands out even in that cast of stand out actors. Doc Hollywood has a similarly talented cast with great dialog and excellent direction. The result is one of those rare Chick Flicks, like Groundhogs Day, that guys don't mind watching, even without a chick. If I had to be stuck on an island with only a handful of DVD movies to watch over and over, this would be one I'd choose. In a rush I'd also grab the Back to the Future trilogy and half a dozen of Arnold's classics.
