Several elderly married couples, church-goers and devout Christians, discuss having gay or lesbian children, and how this has changed their perceptions of what they've been taught--and what they're still being told--by Evangelical Fundamentalists who use their interpretations of scripture to condemn homosexual love. Deeply moving documentary with very likable central subjects probably won't change firmly-set, holier-than-thou religious minds...and may not even expect to. What it does do clearly is to present a level-headed argument in favor of inclusive spirituality, rather than having one's beliefs lead to hatred and violence against others. We see how outsiders throughout history have been the scapegoats for the self-righteous, what this leads to, what the consequences are. Millions of people still don't get it, however, and these are the viewers this film needs to reach. Without them, director Daniel G. Karslake may be preaching to the already-converted. He makes a valiant attempt, a commendable and moving one, but his film needs to be seen and understood by all for it to do its ultimate job. ***1/2 from ****
