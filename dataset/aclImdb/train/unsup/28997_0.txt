Stan Lee was the host of this show and that alone is enough reason to pay homage to it.<br /><br />The best thing about this reality show is that people don't vote each other off. The producers vote them off. Other reality shows where they vote each other off is pretty unfair at times. In this they are judged on how much they live up to the characteristics of a superhero.<br /><br />Many people auditioned but the finalist were: Fat Momma, Feedback, Levity, MonkeyWoman, Iron Enforcer, Lemuria, Tyveculus, Major victory, Creature, Feedback.<br /><br />Its no secret that most the people on this show are actors. But theses days in Hollywood, who isn't? It doesn't make it more staged. This show is definitely a must see.
