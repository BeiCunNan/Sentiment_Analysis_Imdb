If this film is worth watching at all, it is only in some act of compleatism.<br /><br />Both the 1926 and 1959 films are constructed rather haphazardly. But, in 1926, movie-makers were still struggling to discover the basics, whereas in 1959 cinema was a relatively mature medium, and 1959 version could look back on two prior productions (not counting The Circular Staircase, 1915 and 1956). One infers that the 1959 version was made in haste, with a low budget, and perhaps with a lack of concern.<br /><br />The screenplay itself is pedestrian. At one or more point, each of the characters does something unnatural because Wilbur (who wrote the screenplay and directed the film) did not find a way to advance the story naturally.<br /><br />The sets, lighting, camera angles, and music give this movie the feel of a television production of that same era. For example, when there is meaningful use of shadow, it is only to produce simple silhouettes. (I don't know how the actual television production, from a little less than a year later, compares to this movie.)<br /><br />This film has apparently been allowed to slip into the public domain. My suggestion is that, before one spends even the small sum charged by a publisher like Alpha Video, one should down-load a copy from the 'Net and watch that. If one disagrees with my assessment, then he or she will still be free to buy a higher quality copy for future viewing.
