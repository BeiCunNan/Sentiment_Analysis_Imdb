"Papillon" stroke me as a little shocking since I wasn't expecting so much "controversial" material in a movie this old, in other words, a movie with Steve Mcqueen. Homosexuality, nudity, loads of blood and gore, elements which today STILL have it hard and are somewhat still regarded as tabu. The movie itself is highly entertaining and beautiful to watch but I wasn't really impressed with neither the acting or the story. Steve Mcqueen was never a very good actor for my standards of acting and although he has many really bright moments in this one his inability to stop switching his role on and off to his usual Steve Mcqueen persona didn't help much. Dustin Hoffman is better but is still more of an "along for the ride" character, not his greater work. Prison movies are always entertaining just for their location and this one is saved by some great torture scenes and escapes. Well worth the watch though. 7/10
