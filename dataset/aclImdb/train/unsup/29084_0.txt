One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time. It's rare treat to find erudite wit and slapstick humor coexisting. I found myself thinking about it at work the next day and laughing. The cast is terrific and I suspect we'll be hearing more from Erika Burke and Juliet Furness who did splendid jobs with Macbeth and Lady M respectively.
