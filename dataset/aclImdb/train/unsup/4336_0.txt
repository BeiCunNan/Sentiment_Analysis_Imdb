If anyone loved the first home alone, chances are they like this one just as much. and i did too. sure, Kevin is getting older, but that is nothing compared to how mad Marv and harry are. And they want revenge.<br /><br />So in the last movie Kevin was home alone, but Santa Claus has done him one better this year. when the family arrives at the airport, Kevin gets separated, and ends up going to new york...all alone, on his own personal vacation, which is what he wished for, but that wish soon turns into a nightmare when he has to deal with a nosy doorman, a crazy bird-loving lady, and the returning antagonists, Marv and harry, who broke out of prison.<br /><br />Many directors and movie makers that make a sequel to a film %90 of the time make a failure. but in this case, no one failed. the original home alone spawned 3 extra movies, this being one of them, the next one being a colossal make, the one after that a colossal failure made only for TV. the bottom line, go and see this movie, it is well worth it.<br /><br />don't wait for YTV to show it at Christmas. see it now. right now.<br /><br />9/10
