this movie sucks and is in no mean entertaining. the only cool thing is the killer puppets!! and the creepy music. i hardly know the names of the characters because they were barely mentioned.<br /><br />the horrible plot: a country boy working at a gas station starts working for a puppet master while Toulon(the puppet master) plans to turn the boy into a puppet. the acting is outrageously pitiful. the boy seems half asleep throughout the movie. it is not scary! spare yourself the 90 minutes and watch a good movie. avoid at all costs. this movie is so boring too. i don't know how/why i finished it. it looks so good on the DVD cover but it is so bad. i hated it.1/10. i haven't seen any other movies in this series but i'm sure they are somewhat better. at least waist your time on those or good horror movies like Clownhouse by Victor Salva.<br /><br />Rated R for Some Strong Violence/Gore and for Some Language
