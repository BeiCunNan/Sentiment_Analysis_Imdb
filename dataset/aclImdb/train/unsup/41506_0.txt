Bad acting. Bad storyline. Bad special effects. This movie was a disaster. I love vampire and zombie just as much as the next guy, but this movie sucks. The thing that i hated most was the stupid voice over. Some guy trying to push the boundary on how low his voice can go while recording it on a phone. I also hated that the acting was about as convincing as the acting done in my ninth grade drama class. This low budget film is the lamest attempt of a vampire movie I've ever seen. if u wanna watch a vampire movie watch blade. The guys that made this shouldn't quit their day job. I think rapid fire production (the people that made this) should really think if this is their true calling.
