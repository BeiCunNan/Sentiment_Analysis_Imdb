I watched Bitter Blood to its bitten end, three grueling hours! You might ask why I watched to the end. Well, after sitting through the indescibably awful first two hours, I needed to see how this mess ended. Let me just say that when I shut my TV off at 11pm I was less than happy. Out of the 1602 movies I've voted on, one of the three I've given a rating of 1. Horrible.
