What attempts to pass itself off as a near feature length production is actually a very deceptive short that showcases some of the worst excuses for film-making. Fans of bad acting will rejoice. Those that love and adore horrible special effects, unoriginal plot twists, lame situations, bad characterizations, and banal cinematography will be completely riveted to their seats. Filthy tries desperately to shock and scare but ultimately just fails. About every horror classic is ripped off, oops I mean played homage to. It is obvious that the filmmakers behind this low, low budget exercise in schlock cinema are horror fans, but they could have attempted to insert some originality into this mess. Instead, we get a lame rip off of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Figures since the film is only self distributed, meaning you get ripped off of fifteen dollars and some "filmmaker" ships you a DVD from his parents' basement. And speaking of parents' basements, is that where this film was shot, since it features some of the worst sets I have ever seen. Horror fans, please save your money, unless you desperately wish to burn a copy of this train wreck. Otherwise sit back and be insulted by the on screen "brutality." Every scene is poorly composed and shot and the direction for the actors is completely missing in action. Actually the only "brutality" is what the audience feels for having to endure this over long (and that's bad for a short), amateurish, and completely uneventful movie. Bravo guys, here's to another feature, I can't wait to see what you come up next, let's hope its even shorter.
