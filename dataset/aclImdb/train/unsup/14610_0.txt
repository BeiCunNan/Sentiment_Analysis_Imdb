I liked this movie a lot, in many ways much more that than the original Mimic. In particular, Alix Koromzay is great playing the slightly flaky, completely adorable bug-nut scientist/teacher. She is much more interesting than Mira Sorvino, who wasn't bad in the first movie. The story here is simpler, not a bad thing in a horror flick, as the plot stays on a straight course with good effect. For those looking for big-time special effects, Mimic 2 might not satisfy. But for some good campy fun and scares, check this one out.
