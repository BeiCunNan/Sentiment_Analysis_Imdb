When people saw the film "Day of the Dead" for the first time, some said that it should be burned on a pyre... I think that they really meant Ghosthouse.<br /><br />I don't know what is worse about this film... The fact that the cast attempts to act or that it actually tries to be a horror movie. The premise is horrible, the acting is worse and I am not even going to comment on the directing or editing. (When you see the shadow of the sound man in a shot, you should be shot). AND WHAT IS THE OBSESSION WITH CHILI?????<br /><br />Don't ever bother... ever....
