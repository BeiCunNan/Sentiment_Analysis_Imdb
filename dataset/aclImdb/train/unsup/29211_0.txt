I liked this movie just about as much as the first, if not more. I know it's odd to say that about a sequel, and a sequel going straight to DVD without it's original cast no less, but I really liked it. I thought it was a good movie about following your heart and finding your place and passion. Some people are saying that it has the same storyline as the original, but I didn't see that. I thought it was completely different. There are different people, different surroundings. Sarah is already at Julliard in this one and she's in love with rap and hip-hop music at this point. How can you be more different than that? I'll definitely buy it to add it to the original in my collection of DVDs at home. :)
