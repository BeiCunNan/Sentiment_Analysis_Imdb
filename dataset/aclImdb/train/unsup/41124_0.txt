It is hard to believe how drivel like this not only makes it onto TV, but gets nominated for FOUR Emmys, and becomes one of the most loved kids' cartoons of all time. It is so sad (I mean as in pathetic) - death loses its sting after an episode of this, and it is so awfully predictable and unfunny that you feel insulted. This is really just drivelly nonsense for the 5 - 8 year old kids - there is real talent in other places. Expect nothing from Spongebob Squarepants - it is so awful that you may want to cap yourself in the head. "Over-rated" is the only word that describes this faeces - underwater fun for kids is much better done in Finding Nemo, and this is really just an example of the sort of cr*p Nickelodeon airs. Drake and Josh is also awful - bad American kids' comedy is now becoming a big business. Steer clear of Spongebob completely - unless you are a small kid who has not come to realise the true brains in the TV industry.<br /><br />The Americans may make better feature films than us Brits, but we do better comedy - the case being further proved by this (as well as the whole Nickelodeon channel) - the worst cartoon of the past decade. 1/10
