The movie is fine, but what makes me flush it down the drain is that the people creating it portray it as a true story, when it is in fact BS! Kevin Mitnick never caused money loss or economical losses for the companies claimed. He sat locked down without contact to the world. 3 years without trial, probation or bail. FREE KEVIN. He did hack into companies to get code for the reason of doing it. This is a crime usually punished with a fine or a month in jail. Kevin sat inside until 2000, and got to use the internet not until 2003. This man is a hacker yes, not a cracker. The justice system is about who wins a case, the federal government or you. John Markoff at the NY Times made Kevin so famous with his ignorant articles that the government couldn't afford to loose this one. Kevin is a true product of the American ways, stupid morons that have no idea how to use a computer sit and try to educate the people who do, hackers, by using there money, influence and power to shut them down. Imagine the argument the government gave for Kevin being in solitary today, "if he so much as has access to a payphone, he can call a certain number and whistle a certain frequency to create a nuclear war". This is one of the reasons Kevin sat in jail for! What bullshit, big brother sees you and then some more.
