The live action version of WICKED CITY is one big mess of a movie, as all sorts of monsters chase each other and an anti-monster squad pursues the various monsters. The special effects go from awful to awesome, and the acting is typical Hong Kong cheese whiz. Very little of it makes any sense, so what good special effects there are, are basically wasted. Maybe it makes sense to a Chinese audience, but an endless series of shots of a toy model of a commercial airliner being ridden (!) by various characters made absolutely no sense to this viewer. I will say the actress playing the lead female monster is one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen, and she has some nude and near-nude scenes that you'd never find in an equivalent American flick. But she alone is not worth seeing this abomination.
