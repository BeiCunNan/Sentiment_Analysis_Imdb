because the commentary with the director, producers and Edie Falco is quite enlightening, in respect to both the film and the making of any low-budget film. Well worth it for me (I own it).<br /><br />The performances are all fine, and it is a fitting role for Madeleine Kahn's last film appearance. Too bad that she was gone from movies for so long, especially after seeing this.<br /><br />**Possible Spoiler Ahead**<br /><br />To respond to the person who felt that the movie is named for its most "appealing" character, I disagree. It would seem to me that the film is named so because Judy is the one character in the film who has any real desire to leave this community and, however misbegotten, acts upon that desire. One hopes that it will inspire the lead to be less skeptical about such a crazy type of dream and to take the chance to pursue his own dreams, e.g., to go away and actually learn how to make the movie about this town that he wants to make.
