Oh yeah. This movie was nothing but the purest form of crap from beginning to the very end. Everything is wrong here. It's difficult to find out where to start, but I'll begin with the story. It was terrible, and I guess everyone has seen something not far from it a thousand times before. It goes something like this: Bad guys want to buy a woman's land in the middle of nowhere because they're going to build houses there, but she refuses to sell. When bad guys start to get rough, stupid good guy van Damme (who happens to be a bank robber escaped from prison who suddenly becomes the kindest person on earth) comes to the rescue. The whole thing was so stupid that I was hoping for the bad guys to win, and they weren't exactly the coolest bad guys I've seen either. And worse: The action is nearly non-existing from beginning to end. They made some attempts to kick in some action a couple of places in the movie, but they were uninteresting at the best. They even attempted to throw in a fight scene at the end, but it was total failure. I'll consider this a drama movie. That's not van Damme's force. And compared to this, even "Replicant" and "Wake of Death" look good. Watch this movie ONLY if you're looking for a total waste of your precious time.
