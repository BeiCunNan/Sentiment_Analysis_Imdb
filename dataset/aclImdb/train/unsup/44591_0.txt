This movie is perhaps the worst made for TV movie I've ever seen. The plot is predictable, trite, and COMPLETELY LAME. Dean Cain is his usual self, with the same facial expression for every occasion and same mannerisms as "Lois and Clark". He's a 1 character clown. Portia de Rossi was decent at best (she looks like Kate Winslet and Angelina Jolie) but the script wasn't helping her at all. The whole idea of this movie just doesn't work. The ending was so laughable, I swear I will never watch FOX again. Well, I probably will, but never again a TV movie.
