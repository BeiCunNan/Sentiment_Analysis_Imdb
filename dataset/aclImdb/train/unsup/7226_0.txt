If would have been a travesty if Marisa Tomei hadn't won the suppoting actress Oscar for her role as the funniest, best character in a funny great movie. And is My Cousin Vinny hilarious!! Vinny Gambini, a budding lawyer from the Bronx comes to handle is first murder case in the South-with one of the defendants being his relative. Cousin, to be exact. <br /><br />While a murder trial may not seem like the premise for a rollicking comedy, the way it is set up may make you bust a gut. Honestly, you made need a doctor after this movie. This is, in essence, not a courtroom movie as much as it is a fish out of water story. Gambini's cluelessness involving the entire scenario, as well as the aforementioned Tomei's acting are what make this movie.<br /><br />The dialog between Joe Pesci's Gambini and Tomei's Mona Lisa Vito is so well written, I began to wonder if the writer was actually drawing on conversations had with a spouse. These conversations seem like a parody, and a very good one at that, involving both the happiness and anger involved in a marriage, or engagement.<br /><br />The only thing I have to say against My Cousin Vinny, is that I least, think it loses something in multiple viewings. It'll still make you laugh continuously, but not as hard as the first time you saw it, when what was coming was a surprise. This can't really be held against the movie, though. Almost all comedies have this flaw.<br /><br />All in all, this is definitely a movie to watch. On first viewing, it gets a 10/10. I couldn't stop laughing. The 8/10 is for what was lost in repeat viewings. If you haven't yet seen My Cousin Vinny, I absolutely recommend. This is a fabulous, hilarious, quirky comedy. If only all comedies were like this. Most are too busy trying to write risqu√© jokes that they leave out what really matters: the wit.
