I thought world can never go wrong in deciding a film. Well this time, people have gone somewhat wrong. I watched the despite all the warnings given by my friends and I found the movie to be good. Because I went to the theater with a negative mind, I was waiting that when would this movie go wrong as described by reviews. But to my surprise, it was not until the end that I felt displeasure. <br /><br />For me, the movie was just like the whistle that Ranbir blew in the movie. It starts out very well defined but its ending is just not clear (isn't it?). Till the end Sonam was so faithful to her lover but right at the end she seems to have been loving Ranbir, which I didn't like. I thought it could have been much better if the director tried to show her love towards Ranbir as her acceptance due to his devotion and not because Salman has not come. And then leave with Salman after he returns. After all, a girl's feeling should be given more importance.<br /><br />For acting- I like the Old Lady, her dialogs and her expressions. Ranbir and Sonam were both excellent. Rani was also good in her side role. <br /><br />Songs were dull and slow when I heard them in my car but when I saw them in the movie I liked them very very much.<br /><br />I cut a point for Ranbir's towel misadventure. I didn't knew about it before I went to the movie and when he was flashing it, I thought he cannot drop that but to my fear he actually did. I felt ashamed. That was not at all required in the movie and I wonder how his parents let him do it.<br /><br />Now the director, I can see that director was playing very safe by showing a dream city and shooting only night scenes. I understand that love is more beautiful in night and dreamy places, but if love is great what is day and what is night? So, instead of taking the pain to be creative and show beautiful love even in day and real world environment, director played safe and avoided. Aim was also not clear on his part. They were trying only to make a good movie not a great movie within safe boundaries.<br /><br />And lastly, I liked the way in which Sonam keeps speaking of Id. Whenever she speaks of preparations for Id, I felt how beautiful any festival is and its beauty lies in the people's preparation. I see that such essence of a festival is now all lost.<br /><br />Watch it!
