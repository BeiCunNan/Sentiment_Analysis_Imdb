watched this movie tonight, it was very very dry...we almost turned it off............................but we figured to keep going.......boy was it a mistake............... the acting.............sucked...............the plot...............well it was more of a made for TV movie based on a true story............... if you value any sec of your time...don't watch this...i want my time back but will never get it....just say no to indy films...they all suck...they are just like this... I was asking my wife.."do you think they got paid for this?? like the main actors" we figured maybe like a few hundred a week? awful awful stuff.. I don't know why I keep seeing crappy movies but there are just so many of them!!!!!!!!!
