One of the other posters here refers to "harsh and unsubstantiated" reviews - how right you are. I'm not sure what people were expecting from a film called Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds, but I found the whole thing delightful from start to finish.<br /><br />There is ample eye candy in the shape of Marco Dapper and Brett Chukerman. (Although Ryan Carnes is sorely missed. The boy is a subtle and sensitive actor trapped in the body of an Abercrombie & Fitch model.) Yes, there is a totally unbelievable plot, but this is a farce, after all. Rebekah Kochan seems to be channeling Jennifer Coolidge, and I mean that as a huge compliment, and kept me laughing all the way through the film's brisk and breezy ninety minutes.<br /><br />Great fun.
