Possible Spoilers There is no sence comparing this film with the first one they are completely different movies. The first movie is an exercise in horror and scaredthe crap out of me, the sequel (although there are a number of scary scenes, when they see the manifestation of sadako and her mother for example) is more of a thriller come mystery movie. The only really major disappointment in this movie is how sadako is manifested, in the first she was a faceless unstoppable force but in the sequel (except the scene in the well when she is quite literally faceless) she is portrade as a normallish girl........just a disapointment.
