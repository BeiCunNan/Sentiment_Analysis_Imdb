The acting by Russo wasn't bad, but that's the best I can say about it. This is the worst movie that I have seen since The Thin Red Line and Lost in Translation. There are too many unanswered questions: How did the cops get involved? Who's money was it? Where did it come from? (Maybe the Greek Gods like in Clash of the Titans?) Why didn't the guy know about bullet proof vests? Why did Dora (Russell) have to say "They raped me"?<br /><br />It is terrible. Seeing Steve Railsback who looked worse with his lip gloss than my 93 y.o. grandmother when she misses with red lipstick.<br /><br />Russells' character was a stripper? Good thing they didn't show it. Maybe in the fifties?
