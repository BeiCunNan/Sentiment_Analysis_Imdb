I don't expect much out of low budget horror flicks so I was pleasantly surprised by some of the elements of this obviously low budget movie. First, the two female leads held their own. Especially when you consider the dialogue they had to work with. Second, the mask was really cool. Third, I enjoyed the 3D haunted house sequences. Lastly, the chase scenes were done pretty well. Now for the bad news. The script was very predictable and too familiar. The writer clearly ripped off a lot of his material from movies that were big in that genre at the time. Aka - Scream. The sound was bad in certain scenes and the low budget was obvious throughout the movie as far as quality. Some of the other actors were down right horrible. I still don't quite understand the ending of this film. Overall, I wouldn't watch it again but it was fine entertainment for one night. Like I said, I didn't expect much so I wasn't disappointed. I've definitely seen a lot worse.
