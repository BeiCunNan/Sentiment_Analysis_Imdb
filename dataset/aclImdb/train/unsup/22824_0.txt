I watched this movie when I was a kid 20 years ago. I just rented it the other night for my nephews, and it still had me laughing out loud. I admit, it starts somewhat slow, until Howie Mandel's character gets more screen time. About 20 minutes into it, and we were all laughing for the rest of the evening. Most of todays so called comedies are trash. With the exception of a few swear words (sh!t and a$$hole), this movie is great for all ages. The 5 of us - 9,10,14,29, and 32 all watched it and were were laughing aloud all night. I can't explain the low ratings, unless people just watched the first 15 or so minutes and didn't watch it all the way through. But this movie is a comedy classic!
