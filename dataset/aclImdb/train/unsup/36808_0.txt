I found this movie so disappointing that it inspired me to write this, my first review. The only genre appropriate for this movie is Horror because of possible shock factor at the type of murders committed. However, considering the repetitive nature of this film, only the first murder could really be considered "shocking".<br /><br />I find myself shying away from horror movies because I scare easy, however, even I did not find this movie scary. There was no suspense. The movie was merely disgusting. You could not even really classify it as "gore" because the repulsive part was more the idea of the murders rather than what was shown.<br /><br />The "romance" part of this movie was laughable. Heather Graham's character was poorly developed, and I was not convinced that Inspector Abberline would fall in love with her. I suppose the fact that Mary Kelly didn't once solicit men, despite being a whore, like all the other women was an attempt to soften her character and make their love more believable. It didn't work on me.<br /><br />This movie was extremely predictable - you knew what was going to happen next throughout the entire film. I am of the opinion that the potential for a good movie was there, but the execution failed in producing it. I confess, I have not read the novel it was based on.
