I would reminisce like most people I know and ask "where have all the good cartoons gone?", and I do, but regardless, the good cartoons were made, and this was one of them! For one thing, it was an original idea. It did use characters from previous Disney endeavors (Launchpad) which I think enhanced it. The villains were a riot! They were in a class by themselves! I remember having a Megavolt action figure, I don't remember what happened to him, but when I found out he was voiced by Dan Castellanetta (Homer Simpson), I really, really wanted that action figure back! Bushroot is cool, the Liquidator rocks!! Splatter Phoenix was an inspiration for a character in my animation series I'm developing, Taurus Bulba was a jerk (and a great one), but my favorite (and probably yours too) was Negaduck! Negaduck is the only Disney villain (or character, for that matter) to ever wield a chainsaw. Everyone needs to see this cartoon. I can't continue to write about it without spoiling anything or reminiscing about how I used to get yelled at in first grade for telling my teacher that I invited these characters to school to join us for lunch. Ah...those were the days!
