When I heard the title 1st I thought it must be a horror movie or something but when I saw it I enjoyed it very much. Because the movie reminds me myself. Not the way my parents wants me something different that I want, you know our school in here is just like their's. No girls and so boring and like them I'm passing the final year in my high school and after that I'm going to university. I saw the movie on December 2005. Now all of them are grown and are real men. When they recorded the movie I was just a baby because I'm born in 1988. In addition I wanna say that was a very cool movie and I liked it a lot and a big thanks to Robbin Williams with his excellent play.
