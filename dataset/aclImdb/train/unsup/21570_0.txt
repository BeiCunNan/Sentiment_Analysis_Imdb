I saw Demonoid very late one night, intrigued by the weird sounding plot. The plot is indeed very strange and a touch nonsensical, but the movie has such a fast pace that I never questioned any of the happenings too much. Some of the dialogue is hilarious, as are the occasional action sequences. The acting is as low rent as you might expect, except Samantha Eggar, who is as pretty and talented as ever. The effects are cheap looking, but effectively gruesome for the most part and funny when they aren't. The film begins very well, with a potent surreal feel to some of the early sequences, especially down the mine. The endings classy too. This is one of the best killer hand movies I've seen, certainly the oddest (and I really dig the oddness). Well recommended to connoisseurs of the obscure and bizarre, anyone looking for conventional film making qualities or coherence will be less well served. Best to watch at 3AM with a lot of beer/cheap cider.
