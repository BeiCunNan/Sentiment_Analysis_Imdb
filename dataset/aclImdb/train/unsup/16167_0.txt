'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers', 'A Nightmare On Elm Street 2', 'Childs Play 3', and 'Candyman 3' all have something in common.If you're thinking that they're all sequels, you are right, but there's something else.All of these movies are examples of underrated sequels.I liked all of these movies and I don't care what other people have to say about them.I thought that 'Candyman 3: Day of the Dead' was a pretty decent horror movie with another groundbreaking performance by Tony Todd.Nobody will ever play a better Candyman than him.That's a fact that we horror fans should know.I haven't seen the 2nd movie yet, but I do have to say that the first and the third were pretty good.Maybe the third wasn't as good as the first, but I still found it to be a good movie.After you're finished reading my review, I want you to go to a mirror and say Candyman 5 times.If he shows up and tries to kill you, then it serves you right for thinking that this movie was totally pointless.If the Candyman franchise wants to be really popular, then there needs to be a 4th installment.Let's hope that Tony Todd is willing to play Candyman again.
