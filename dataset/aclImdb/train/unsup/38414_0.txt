When I finished watching "Weight of water" I had the impression that I just had watched two different films mixed to each other. One of them was pretty interesting, and it told the story of a murder committed on an American small village populated by immigrant fishers 140 years ago. The other story was boring, the characters was such a mess, and it was plenty of narrative mistakes: occurred at present time and it's about a journalist who travels (along with his husband, her brother in law and the girlfriend of that one) to that small village in order to investigate the incident and take some pictures. We're told about his troubled marriage, and some other things we don't give a damn about. <br /><br />So one story destroys the other. One part of the script blows up the other one, and even the actors (especially Sarah Polley) made a better job in the "historic" part. Yeah, Sean Penn was over there, but this time his performance was pretty forgettable (he just shows us some of his most known "tricks") ... and what to say about Liz Hurley's work!! God, she may have an impressing body, but she's quite a bad actress with that femme-fatale look in her face 100% of the time. <br /><br />Anyway, I didn't expect that much of Kathryn Bigelow. Anyone did?<br /><br />*My rate: 4/10
