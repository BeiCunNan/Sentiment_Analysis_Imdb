This is a very good documentary and shows the more fair image of Islam not commonly seen in the West, of a religion that was flourished in culture, science, and art. It also shows its more violent parts in history. Nevertheless, I find that it ends all too abruptly and it fails to comment on any contemporary issues about Islam, which I guess would have made this documentary too long.<br /><br />If you are interested in Islam, find yourself a copy of this and watch as it is entertaining and informative.<br /><br />Especially at this time, it is necessary for Western audiences to learn more about Islam.
