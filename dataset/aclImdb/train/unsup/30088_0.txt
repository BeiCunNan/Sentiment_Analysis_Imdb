Smackdown is a great show. It has the matches and entertainment in it. But Raw is still my favorite brand. I like Smackdown a lot, but still I think Raw is better by ever way. Smackdown every week is getting a new person on the roster. Raw sticks with the same people and gets a new person every once and a while. JBL sucks, Orlando Jordan sucks, The Dicks suck, Paul London sucks, Rey Mysterio is OK, Batista is OK, Matt Hardy sucks, I completely get sick of Holla Holla Player from Teddy Long. He is just to damn annoying. Palmer Canon isn't the real name of that fake network guy. His name really isn't Palmer Canon. He just does that on the show. Since when has it been called Friday Night Smackdown instead of Smackdown. I really like Smackdown it is a very entertaining show, but Raw is just still better.
