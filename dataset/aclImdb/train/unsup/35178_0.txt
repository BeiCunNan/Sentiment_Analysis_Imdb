This movie really isn't good. I honestly don't see how so many people like it. The story is pretty shallow, the "lessons learned" are clich√©, and the music is boring. There I said it. Also, It's laced with fake "edginess", almost to the point of being unbearable. It's only saving grace Is the actors, who understandably still work well together after all those years, even newcomers Rosario Dawson and whoever plays Joanne fit in nicely. But everything else, and I mean everything, is generic and tiring.<br /><br />P.S. I understand that some people will say the anyone who doesn't like this movie is homophobic. They're wrong.
