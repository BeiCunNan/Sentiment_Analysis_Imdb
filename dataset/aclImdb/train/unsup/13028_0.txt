One of my all time favourite movies, starring my favourite actor Charlton Heston, what can I say about this film other than magnificent, it is even more entertaining than Richard Matheson's excellent 'I am Legend' upon which it is based. Some reviewers feel this film to be campy and dated, but I heartily disagree, these reviewers are obviously shallow minded snobs, reared on awful modern cgi nightmares.<br /><br />In the movie Heston delivers a great performance as Robert Neville the last man on earth, talking to himself, hearing phones ringing on the edge of sanity. The action scenes where we see his gun toting avenging angel persona are extremely entertaining, enhanced by Ron Grainer's amazing score, one of the greatest film scores ever recorded in my opinion. Mention must also be made of Anthony Zerbe as the megalomaniac leader of the family Mathias, he delivers great fanatical lines, a totally believable cult leader. <br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie already do yourself a favour and see it instantly!
