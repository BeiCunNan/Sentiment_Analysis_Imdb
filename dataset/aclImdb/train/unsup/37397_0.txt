Well, after reading the first 3 pages of comments, I can't believe anyone made it this far, but if you did, here is what I have to say....<br /><br />"Sirocco" is a complete waste of time , unless you can learn what not to do in a film. dull and drift-less from the first scene, "Sirocco" literally BLOWS, right out of the theatre. A complete waste of talent, and paper for the scripts, Bogart, Cobb, Sloane Corey, Mostel,Mohr can't make this clunker work, WOW ! I can't believe I wrote that, but it is a FACT.<br /><br />Aimless in its direction, Curtis Bernhardt(Director) , doesn't deserve to get paid for this sch-mucky remake attempt of "Casablanca."<br /><br />He doesn't know how to blend romance with drama or action, I guess he read the script ?, and didn't know how to make dramatic changes. <br /><br />Violette(Marta Toren) is the Ingrid Berman clone, and a very light clone at that. While lovely to the eye, she lacks the depth or skill in acting to create any chemistry between her and Bogey, incredible.<br /><br />As I stated previously, this is how NOT to make a film, and just about anyone can these days. People are often confused if this movie was filmed in the bazaar or the catacombs, it should have been filmed in the dark, and kept there ! I gave this film 3 stars , just for the cast, a negative 10 for the script. Note: for future screen writers, use this a template to build against, maybe you can reedit the film to have some dramatic tension, or rewrite scenes that would build to a climax, just not the veritable collapse that it currently does.<br /><br />All in all, Bogart should have saved his money, and credibility.
