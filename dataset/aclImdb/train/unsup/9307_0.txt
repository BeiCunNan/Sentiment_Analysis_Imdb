If you were tempted to buy this on DVD, or pay for your seat, tough luck. Borrowed it from my local library and obviously this does not go anywhere near the now-cheesy-but-still-a-classic JAWS or the ABYSS from which it borrows.<br /><br />Why did I give 1 to "Narnia" and 2 to this? For the skill in making something terrible in both cases with: 1- loads of money and a worldwide manipulation campaign 2- no money and no marketing gurus behind.<br /><br />This is still something that does not deserve to be watched twice, maybe not even once. CGI is still something you would be proud of if you got it out of your own computer. <br /><br />If anything, this film illustrates the concept of George Lucas who claims that CGI and digital cinema will bring filming within the reach of new talents. These were not the ones he referred to, as the script, the actors, the special effects remain terrible (by today's standards... check King Kong 1933 and enjoy), but some classics were made on a shoestring and we saw worse stuff done by great actors and directors.<br /><br />It is no wonder this is as cheesy as it gets, but the Academy of Cinema also has its bad students.
