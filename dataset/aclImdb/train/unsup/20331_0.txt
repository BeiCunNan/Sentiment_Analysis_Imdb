I usually try to bring a little more creativity in the titles for my reviews but I'm still to speechless after seeing this "Dead Doll". It's just...putrid! This film strongly reminded me of those cheap, amateurish and entirely worthless 70's films directed by Eddie Romero, Al Adamson or  even worse  Ted V. Mikels. I'm sure that writer/director Adam Sherman is a big fan of those guys because his own movie is just as retarded. "Dead Doll" pretty much is a 70 minutes long sexually perverted fantasy of some weirdo guy on crack! A seriously troubled "artist" murders his girlfriend and processes her corpse into a life-size doll that he keeps around his workshop. From that moment on, every male that lays eyes on this doll becomes obsessed with her sexual charisma and they end up brutally murdered. There's not the slightest bit of coherence in the screenplay, only constant and brief introductions of new loser characters going nuts over a girl that even isn't that attractive. In fact, she's quite intolerable with her squeaky voice talking nonsense all the time! Sherman's blackly humorous intentions totally miss their effect and the completely non-stylish nudity only seems used as padding. The gore sequences are too fake to be disturbing but they don't qualify as camp, neither. The only possibly advise I can give you is to stay away from "Dead Doll" as far as you can! You'll live longer...
