I think that the comment of "zwerr" is far too over dramatic for this tiny little bit of film. This is not a blockbuster or mega-production like "The passion of Christ" or something like that where you can discuss about several things contained in the movie. "Winning London" is just a relatively cheap made "The Olsens are on holiday"-video-clip. Of course the girls were only 15 an the boys over 20 at production date. This is not to good but to talk about pedophilia and snuff-movies in that context is inappropriate. As long as the girls don't show sexual intercourse with a teacher or parent I don't care about that. Also: US censors tend to look at sexual things in movies. But this one is completely clean. To be honest: This movie tries to be funny but it's not, the hostage-scene is suitable for kids (I would call it boring) and the fact that The Olsen's were executive-producers of this film (at the age of 15) shows: "Winning London" is strictly for Olsen-fans. If you really like to criticize, watch programs like "Malcolm in the middle" where there is far more to find on the one hand and which is more fun to watch on the other hand.
