This was a total waste of film, time, resources, and ... well, never mind, there WAS no talent.<br /><br />I don't know what this was trying for, except perhaps a rap musical, but it didn't work! This was a totally disgusting display of a serious lack of talent, direction, and vision. It was worse than boring. It was horrid! There IS no dialog, no enjoyment, no point to this "work." Absolutely wretched, and completely disgusting display of new money, no class, and a total lack of taste.<br /><br />I want my ninety minutes back! *wretches* This bull snot doesn't rate a rating.<br /><br />the Fiend :.
