Clint Eastwood returns to his most famous non-western role of Inspector Harry Callaghan in the third of the San Francisco based crime thrillers. This time he is up against a group of terrorists who have robbed a military warehouse and are threatening use their newly acquired arsenal if the city doesn't give them two million dollars.<br /><br />Of course this being a Dirty Harry film we see him dealing with a shop full of armed thieves in a way that leaves the shop in ruins and Harry transferred to Personnel, a department he does not hold in high regard. Luckily this transfer doesn't last too long, after the arms robbery he is back in Homicide with a new partner, the recently promoted Inspector Kate Moore, played by Tyne Daly before she found fame in "Cagney and Lacey". At first Harry isn't too pleased with having to break in a new partner but inevitably grows to value her contribution.<br /><br />The terrorists unfortunately seem a little too insane, they claim to be doing it "for the people" but happily kill anybody who crosses their path... at least the chief bad guy gets a spectacular ending which I won't spoil here. Almost as important as the case against the terrorists is the city politics where the mayor and chief of police wish to talk up Harry and Kate's role just to further their equal opportunities policies even though they had no role in the arrest they are getting the credit for.<br /><br />Despite the film having some weaknesses I'd still recommend it to anybody who enjoyed the other Dirty Harry films or just like cop films in general.
