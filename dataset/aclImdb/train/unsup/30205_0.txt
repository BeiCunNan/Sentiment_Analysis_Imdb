This was a bad movie... Richard Williams (Venus and Serena's Dad) was in this movie and he had ONE LINE "YES" that was it. He looked half dead. The voice overs were very very bad. Yeah the mom sang one song with a woman's voice and the on the next song she was a member of Blackstreet and then back to a woman's voice again... It was funny to see how Generic this was. Another thing, how did the male lead's dad have a mansion and then when they got outside it was a ghetto apartment parking lot. Also, his Spoken Word or shall i say BROKEN WORD was the worst. I guess the best thing about this movie was some of the women. Rent this if you want to laugh and look for mistakes.
