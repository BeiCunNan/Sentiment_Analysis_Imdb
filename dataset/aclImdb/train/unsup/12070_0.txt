Much has been written about whether the events in the movie Hidalgo are true or even feasible. Whether they are true or not is irrelevant as this is a movie made for entertainment. The cast and crew of Hidalgo have done a tremendous job of creating an entertaining and enjoyable film that is respectful of western, Sioux and Arabic cultures. The characterization of Frank Hopkins in this film is one of the best depictions of cowboy behavior in recent history. Cowboys are respectful, courteous, loyal, hard-working and yet, they do play hard. Inclusion of Lakota Sioux and Arabic dialects with large and easy-to-read English subtitles did not detract from the flow of the film. Some reviewers have commented that Mortensen mumbles too many of his lines. One that is accustomed to listening to Native American dialects might find that the softness, quietness and blending of the sounds is characteristic of this native language. The director did an excellent job in casting this diverse group of actors and each brings distinctive touches to their performance. The cinematographer should be commended for capturing the beauty of each locale, and the scenery is gorgeous. Hidalgo delivers the story of a valiant horse who happened to be owned by a man that stumbled, fell and yet through arduous effort regained his sense of self and place in the world.
