Drove 10 hours to see the world premier outside of Dallas and had no regrets. Don Juan and Miquel have a refreshingly different sense of comedy. Add in the straight woman character of Esmeralda and you have quite a team. Filmed entirely at renaissance festivals with a terrific variety of the really great circuit acts they represent some of the greatest variety of characters you will come across in the independent film industry today. This film is great for children of all ages. The character and costume changes that Miguel goes through are quite funny and Esmeralda's facial expressions and demeanor are sure to crack you up. Sit back,relax and enjoy. Can't wait till they release the next film.
