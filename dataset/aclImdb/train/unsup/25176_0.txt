Just saw this total piece of dog you know what on cable. Now when it comes to the Friday the 13th movies you don't expect much especially with all the really awful sequels. This was a toss up between this complete and total atrocity on celluloid. There's movies so bad they're funny but this was a movie that was just plain godawful. This sequel apparently jason can suddenly be reincarnated over and over again and beyond that it probably will cause brain damage to try and waste any further brain cells on trying to understand the pointlessness of what was written by a sadistic 12 year old pervert. It was a toss up between this and Jason Takes Manhattan in terms of idiocy and continuity not that it really takes a lot to come up with something not as stupid and bad as this.
