I'm a fan of poolhall junkies. i loved PJ because everything flowed and the shots were awesome. PJ wasn't so focused on hustling and an obvious fantasy plot line. PJ showed a range of pool players and the community. The kids who get punked, hustlers, pro players, and everything in between.<br /><br />This movie on the other hand was so made up. The director even mentions a few of the lingo used was made up. SG had too much lingo if you asked me. All the clutter messed up the dialogue. Normal people in pool halls do not talk like that and I have been in plenty. So who the hell was the writer trying to target? Cuz I am sure there is only a small population of the nation that can understand everything these kids are blabbering about. And why have 8-ball signature logos when everyone knows the game is 9 ball. The 8-ball has no significance to the movie.<br /><br />Bottom line, the director has no concept of what is true to real-life and what is just made up. this movie is like a report with a whole lot of footnotes, but none of the sources are relevant to the point.
