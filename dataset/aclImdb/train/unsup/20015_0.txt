This is a stop-motion animation movie about a doll that protects his master, a little girl, from rats, and the girl embarks on a fantastic quest that one cannot follow. SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />It is obvious that this is just a cliched dream sequence from the start, but what is up with the "adult" doll marrying the little girl? And the aunt and uncle approve of this?<br /><br />While this may seem like a fantastical flight of whimsy, it seemed to me that a bunch of film school students threw this together haphazardly. "Ok, you guys film an opulent palace, you people film a boring 10 minute ballet scene, and I will make an nonsensical war scene between rats and wind up soldiers. Gold!"<br /><br />This film is an incomprehensible mess. "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" proved that an engaging film could be made using stop-motion techniques, but I guess the producers decided that a story was secondary to celebrity voices and hard-to-follow but beautiful animation. Not really a children or adult film. 5/10
