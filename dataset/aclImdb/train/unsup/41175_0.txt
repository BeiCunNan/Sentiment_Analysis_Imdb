I had read the book once before when it was first released (I had also read Angels & Demons which I enjoyed only slightly more than TDC), and a week before it's release decided to read it again to brush up on the story. Boy was that a mistake. Going into the movie with a fresh knowledge of the story only amplified my frustration. Ron Howards interpretation of the book was all wrong. I felt he left out key bits of information. For instance, he could have focused more on the Pagen symbolism, the Prior and umm how about Da Vinci? Also, the infamous Micky Mouse watch makes a brief appearance but no mention is made.<br /><br />The movie (w/o even reading the book)fell flat. The script was bland at best. I think that the star power over shadowed my expectations. Overall Da Vinci left me unsatisfied.
