WOW! First time I saw this movie in 1993 I was in Kindergarten. I remember the day my mom bought the movie for me when it came out on VHS and I just couldn't stop watching it! Still to this day I still can't stop watching it! The Secret Garden is the most beautiful movie ever made-in every aspect. It's one of "me and my mommy's favorite movies"!. This movie is so great, it even has it's own copy-cat movie(*Cough* LITTLE PRINCESS *cough!*...don't get me wrong, I do like the movie though).<br /><br />This movie has the best 3 child actors I have EVER seen! I'm surprised they haven't become mega-movie actors by now; but atleast they do have one amazing movie that they can add to their resume`!<br /><br />I would give you a summary, but I'd ruin the whole story!! If you want me to, drop me an e-mail asking about The Secret Garden and I'll ruin it for you. Believe me, you'll wanna plan your own Garden.<br /><br />Since alot of people are adding it, I'll add mine as well... Favorite Part: When Mary, Collin and Dickon are in the garden together and Collin learns how to walk for the first time. Also when Collin comes face to face with his father for the first time!!<br /><br />This movie shouldn't stay a Secret! I give it a 10 out of 10
