one of the worst flicks ever made for TV. her acting is atrocious. she is a real creep. watching this mess is like having a tooth pulled without Novocaine. why this ever was put on DVD is beyond me. this horror should have sunk in the swamp waste along with the leeches and snakes. i blew a buck on this mess and trashed it promptly. what a waste of a buck. fields is one person that cannot act. her looks are a retina burning eyesore. why indeed would carradine even think of acting along with her. he was the only redeeming feature in the whole movie. the story line was weak; the plot , silly and the VHS tape it was taken from was a horror in itself. wish i could take all the copies that exit and destroy them. what a blessing for the world!
