This movie was a rewrite of a Broadway play, where the husband buys the house that George Washington supposedly slept in. But here it's the wife (Ann Sheridan), while husband Jack Benny gets increasingly irritated with the amount of money he's having to shell out. And if you're familiar with Benny's tightwad character, you'll know immediately why the roles were reversed for this film. But the real star is indeed Percy Kilbride, better known from the Ma and Pa Kettle films. One look at his deadpan puss and it's all over for Benny and for the audience. He's the one holdover from the play, and Benny insisted--rightly--on having him in the picture. Also fun to watch is Charles Dingle as a grumpy neighbor. Maybe Benny doesn't have Cary Grant's sophistication in "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House," but this is a funny picture, especially if you're a Benny fan. By the way, a station in Norfolk, VA, used to show this movie every Christmas morning. Why, I don't know, but it's no doubt good to relax with when the presents are unwrapped--or any other time of year.
