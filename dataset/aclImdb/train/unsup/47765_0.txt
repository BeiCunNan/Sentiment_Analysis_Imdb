While viewing this film, I found myself laughing through out the entire picture. Diana Wynyard(Alice Overton),"Gaslight",'40, was married to Clive Brook,(Dr. Jack Overton),"Love in Exile",'36 and this couple seemed to argue and fight all the time, Alice kissed a friend innocently in the garden and all sorts of problems started. Jack Overton decided their marriage after ten years was becoming boring and wanted a divorce. This divorce became off again on again through out the entire picture. The Butler,(Phillips) Arthur Hoyt, "Hail The Conquering Hero",'44 did not know if he was coming or going, bringing luggage out to the car and back again and finally was claimed a hero in possibly saving this marriage. This was definitely a COMEDY and should not be taken seriously at ALL!
