Spoiler Alert I have to say that when I first saw the movies Rocky 1-3, I was in bliss. The story's were brill. Something that made you never want to see the end of it, went away wishing the film had another half hour left or so. Rocky 4 was 50/50. Stallone wanted to make a movie about change, hardly see any change apart from the gloryhunter fans at the end going from Drago's to Rocky's! Dunno why they had to kill Apollo off, could've just sidelined him with injury or something, but in my view the pace and energy of the fight made up for it, and one more thing, no mention of Mickey??? Apart from the flashback sequence. And then, Rocky V. Another Rocky is always a pleasure in my view, but the movie could've been better! Stallone stated that originally Rocky was supposed to die in his last fight with tommy gunn, but changed weeks prior to production, claiming the film is about recovering from a disaster, which is a great plot to go by, but why did he have to have a street fight? I like the idea of the sadness that he ignored his son by paying loads of attention to Tommy, then tommy went awol with george duke, but at least he could have had Apollo or Creed's manager(I forget the name) train him for one last fight in the ring, and then beats tommy gunn, wins the title, and wins back his fortune. Or even he died in the ring after he beat him, and had millions cheer him on or mourn him as he went. <br /><br />Rocky VI???? nnnnnnoooooo! sly's too old, fat, slow and lost his talent in writing. 5 is enough. His career's going down the crap shoot, he should just relive his past glory and call it day. <br /><br />Oh yeah, the actor who plays Gunn should've been the one who really retired! haha.
