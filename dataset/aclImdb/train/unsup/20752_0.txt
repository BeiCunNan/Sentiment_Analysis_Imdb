You can never expect much from a low budget feature. I didn't expect much when I first saw this movie. But time and time again, I'm reminded not to judge a book by its cover. <br /><br />The script wasn't amazing, but it'll still surprise you. The acting was great with the exception of a few characters. Anna Maria Horsford, a veteran actor, was probably the best actor in the entire movie. Close behind would be Bizzy Bone and Alexis Fields. Everyone fit into their roles perfectly. Then comes the star, RonReaco Lee. He is also a great actor, but I don't think his all of his talent was showcased in this movie. At some points in the movie, he seemed out of his element. Some scenes just didn't seem believable. But.. With the exception of those scenes, he's on the road to a fruitful acting career.<br /><br />Overall, it's a heart-wrenching movie. You usually don't find your emotions coming out while watching other low-budget flicks, but you will here. If you're lucky enough to find it on DVD, it's worth the money. It blew me away in my first viewing, and it somehow continues to today.
