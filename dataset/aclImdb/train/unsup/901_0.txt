Great little horror film that i found when i was about 10 at the local book shop for sale under the title scared alive, the back of the cover looked interesting and i thought for 5 dollars, i can't really go wrong, Anyways i got away with buying an M15+ rated film which ten years later I'm so glad i did, The movie starts of with a girl who is getting ready to go for a swim, (notice the weird, but cool pop song she is listening to on a little tape player). So she jumps in, swims around for about 30 seconds then gets out and just sits there, She heres something in the bush, so she turns of the tape to look around, next thing you know a gun is being pointed straight at her head.. and BANG, her head falls into the pool, and the start credits come up, Not to bad for a beginning, But after the credit the storyline is about a bunch of filmmakers that set out to an island to make a light hearted comedy, But the actors that the producer's have set up aren't really what you would call Great,,, or even Good. So the directer decides to make a few change's So that the lead actress Betty Jean doesn't have much to say in the film, but when people start to get killed on the island, (by a killer who always leaves his mark with that tape player that was at the start, but this time it is playing lyrics like Boil me, Nail me, Burn me, Stab me etc and is always swinging around), The actors are scared, and want to know who is doing the slaying's is it one of them?. The one and only actor out of the entire cast left is Betty Jean (Bari Suber), she and the producer get away from the blood bath. But the twist that arrives at the end will leave you shock'd..... All and All i thought that this movie was great for a slasher, it has some fun, sex, scares, and gore.. oh and an awesome soundtrack by Joel Goldsmith. Bari Suber was great, shame she never did anything after this. 10/10
