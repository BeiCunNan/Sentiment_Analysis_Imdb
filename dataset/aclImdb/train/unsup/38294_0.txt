I am a really big fan of the first part of "From Dusk Till Dawn". Today I bought the english version of part 2. I thought: "Yeah, part one is great, "Texas Blood Money" will surely be cool too. I has to be good, cause it costs about 30-40 US-Dollars." But it wasn't. The story is absolutely weak, the actors too and the special effects are one of the worst I've ever seen!!! They only run/drive around and kill all people they can in such a cruel way I have never seen!<br /><br />What did Quentin Tarantino do? The first part is such an excellent, great, fantastic movie but the sequel is so bad. Why. Does he only want some more money, cause of the first success?? I am totally disappointed. But I think I will buy part 3 too. Some people said it's nearly as good as part 1. I hope so...
