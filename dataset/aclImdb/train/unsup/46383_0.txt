Where to start? Extremely poor lighting-most of the time you couldn't tell what was going on. The actors' are hidden in shadow the majority of the time. It's like someone shot the movie in their unlit basement at midnight. Didn't someone at least have a snakelight or something?<br /><br />The dialogue is pitiful, mundane and the movie plods along at a molasses pace. You spend most of the movie wondering "what just happened?", and trying to figure out one scene while it moves on to the next. <br /><br />The editing is choppy. You'll see characters go into one location, no explanation as to why there there, and then in next scene they're at a different location. It gives the editing job done on "Plan 9 From Outer Space" a run for it's money. Finally, to top it off, Paul Dillon's unibrow is incredibly distracting.<br /><br />I'd skip this movie. My roommate bought it for $1.99 and it wasn't worth that much.
