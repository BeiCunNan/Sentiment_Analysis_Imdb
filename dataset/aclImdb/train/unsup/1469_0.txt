"September Affair" was a film that stayed in our mind when we first watched it a long time ago. Seldom seen these days on television, it still keeps the romantic promise we remembered. The premise, which probably looked possible to the 1950 audience that saw it in its original release, seems unreal today, but this is just escapist entertainment, so it has to be watched in that context.<br /><br />One thing that surprises is the Italy of that era where street traffic was devoid of cars, not the nightmare it became as years went by. This is a romantic travelogue in which the action is set, much like some movies that were shot in that country later on. After all, even in black and white, Capri, Naples, Pompeii, Rome, and Florence are wonderful places to visit.<br /><br />William Dieterle's direction serves the film. The stars, Joseph Cotten and Joan Fontaine show great chemistry. Joseph Cotten, a serious actor, makes an excellent David Lawrence, the man whose marriage has reached an impasse. Joan Fontaine is quite likable as Manina Stuart, the concert pianist that falls head over heels and takes a chance with this practical stranger. Jessica Tandy and Francoise Rosay appear in pivotal roles.<br /><br />"September Song" is heard in the background sung by none other than Walter Huston. This film even with its unlikely premise is still a nice way to spend time with pleasant company.
