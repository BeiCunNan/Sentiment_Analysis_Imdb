I really enjoyed Blackadder. I thought it was funny, interesting and at the same time meaningful - about soldiers being sent to their deaths by incompetent fools, which was commonplace in those days. The episode plots also had their relevance in war, and there were also some good settings, even though there were certain anachronisms. I would say that Blackadder Goes Forth is the best out of all four Blackadder series, and I think it deserves its rating of 9.0/10 on average. A very enjoyable view indeed. Blackadder should be seen by everyone, as it is a comedy of many colours. There are certain characters that I don't like (e.g Captain Darling), but I especially like stupid Baldrick and Blackadder himself. This is the best war/comedy ever made by far. Better than Dad's Army. *****/*****
