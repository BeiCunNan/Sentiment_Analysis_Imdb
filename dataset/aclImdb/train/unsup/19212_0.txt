The Enforcer ranks as one of Bogey's best films. A look at the supporting cast will tell you why.<br /><br />Bogey plays crusading DA Martin Ferguson who is trying to convict mob kingpin Everett Sloane of murder. The crime organization appears to be a thinly disguised version of Murder Inc. (aka the Mafia).<br /><br />Told mostly in flashbacks, we meet an assortment of characters, each of whom is a piece in the overall puzzle. Veteran Ted DeCorsia stands out as Rico, Sloane's right hand man as does Zero Mostel as one of the mobsters. Lawrence (aka Michael) Tolan plays Duke Malloy one of the hitmen who is forced to kill his own girl friend. Roy Roberts and King Donovan appear as the cops.<br /><br />Special mention is saved for veteran western actor Bob Steele (billed as "Robert"), who plays Herman a hit man from Kansas City. Steele plays the character much like the chilling Canino in the earlier "The Big Sleep" (1946). His death scene at the end of the picture is not to be missed.<br /><br />An oddity of this picture is that there was no love interest for Bogey. Know what, It makes for a better and more compact movie. The Enforcer will hold your attention from start to finish. A very entertaining film.
