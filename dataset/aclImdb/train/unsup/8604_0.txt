this is one of those movies that are flimsy story lines sandwiched together by incredibly unrealistic features, stereotypes, and just stupidity. Lets start at the beginning- #1 flimsy storyline. The story is that there's this fat "athletic" loser with ugly spiked hair who never spends time with his friends (only two are shown the entire movie-what a social animal) so he can do everything a mom would normally do because she's dead and he doesn't want his dad to think that they need a mom. He then decides that having a multi-billion dollar computer house would be perfect so he won't have to do so much work. Great reasoning, huh? But the house starts screwing up and begins like sexually harassing the dad. #2- unrealistic features. so there's this multi billion dollar house that a bunch of scientists just decide to give away to a random teenager. okay... Then, the house can do anything. it can make smoothies out of ingredients that the characters never even buy. then it shows where the smoothie ingredients are kept and there's hundreds of oranges in the kitchen island!!!! # 3-sterotypes. the school bully is a tall fat kid who makes kids do whatever he wants. in my life, all the bullies are short losers who
