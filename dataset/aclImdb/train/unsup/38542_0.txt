The original "Pumpkinhead" was nothing great, but at least it had some semblance of intelligent writing. Unfortunately, this sorry sequel seemed more like your average dumb horror flick. The setup for the story wasn't too bad, but the rest of the film ranged from routine, to boring, to just plain stupid. Surprisingly, there were a number of familiar faces in the movie, but every last one of them was wasted. But then again, I didn't exactly have high hopes for this film...after all, how good can a film be when Roger Clinton plays a guy called Mayor Bubba?
