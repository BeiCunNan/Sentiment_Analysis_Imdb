The best things about this lame little comedy are that you actually get to briefly hear Louise Brooks talk (she did mostly silent films) and that it is a short film, not full-length! It just isn't very funny and is a dud in so many ways--especially since the lead, Jack Shutta ("Windy Riley") is about as entertaining as Ebola! Plus, it really doesn't help that the script is pretty limp and poor Miss Brooks is given practically NOTHING to do in the film--she's just there! However, despite all the shortcomings, this is interesting because it's one of the very few times you get to hear Miss Brooks speak on film. Most of her famous films were either silents or poorly dubbed films that were originally silent (MISS EUROPE). However, this isn't a great film if you want to hear her talk because the film quality is very, very poor---which is the case with so many early nitrate films. This film is included with DIARY OF A LOST GIRL and the producers of the Kino video admit that the film quality is a mess but include it because of its significance. Interestingly enough, although you can't hear her perfectly, Miss Brooks appeared to possibly have either a speech defect or perhaps an odd accent--either way, her voice might just be the reason she retired soon after this film.
