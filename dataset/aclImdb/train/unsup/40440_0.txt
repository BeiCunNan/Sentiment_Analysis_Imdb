I bought this movie brand new for $5.00 in the bargain bin .It appeared to be a nice funny family movie.The cover named some top actors.It has some really cute dogs in it; but that's about all it has going for it.I'm usually a big fan of animal movies.Based on the humor i.e. the very tired male genitalia jokes , the farting & pooping (some body get this guy some of the pink liquid) , and all around cheesy lines; the only people who would enjoy this movie would be a group of sixth grade boys.The movie isn't a knock- off of Snow Dogs .I thought Snow Dogs was a really good movie.It's much worse.I would recommend renting this movie only if your video store has Rent one,Get one free specials.Maybe use it as your free rental ... hmm on second thought maybe not.
