La Spagnola had a lot of potential but didn't live up to expectations. The plot just was not strong enough. Despite fine acting this was a missed opportunity. It has its heart in the right place but not a lot really happens. Alice Ansara is a real find and is a young actor we will here a lot more from in the future.<br /><br />
