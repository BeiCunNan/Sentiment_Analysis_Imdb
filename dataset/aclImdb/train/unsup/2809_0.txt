There is so much emotion packed into such a small amount of time. I try to watch it whenever it's aired. Created as a prequel for character the Tin Man from The Wizard of Oz, it tells the story of the violence, love, sacrifices, and the reason for the Tin Man's missing heart.<br /><br />Some of the actors are a bit bad, but overall, the message gets across perfectly. The music is a simple acoustic bit that follows along and fits great. I think how it's filmed in black and white is also very fitting and sets the mood. This short might not have been as good if it was in color, in my opinion.<br /><br />All in all, a great film. Find it, watch it.
