This was, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting is atrocious all around, the stunts and action sequences are quite laughable, and the plot is ridiculous. I almost felt bad for Lou Diamond Phillips. Is this the only kind of role he can get? I expected the film to be at least watchable, but the film lost me within five minutes when the Wahlberg character's girlfriend walks into his apartment, eyes a dismembered body, and says, "He's kinda cute!"<br /><br />1 out of 10. Ugh!
