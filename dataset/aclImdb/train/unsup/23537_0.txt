OMG it was one of the best movies I have seen. Well Pirates of the Caribbean is first then Dark Prince The True Story of Dracula is the second. I loved it. Rudolf Martin was great for the part. He show anger and love and hate very well. anyway I thought Dracula was known as a vampire but when i saw this movie it changed i don't know if this is the absolute true story but it was still a very good movie. I hope that i get to see it again i just saw it on TV today and i thought it was very good I'm also the type of person to believe in that kind of stuff i like myths and true stories and vampires and people who cant die i dig that kind of stuff. i guess I'm kinda crazy but over all I LOVED IT.
