I picked up this movie with a friend because the front cover made it look like it would be pretty good...I never realized how deceiving a movie cover could be. <br /><br />This was truly the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /><br />It is painfully long, and the only reason I kept watching is because I was waiting for this guy to die, but after legitimately being killed off 5 times: he's poisoned (all of his men die from this poison may I add) yet somehow he has enough energy to walk back through the desert (dehydration), fly a plane, which is later shot down and crashes (miraculously he doesn't get shot/survives the crash), then somehow through all that carries his wife through the desert to safety (she was dying of dehydration/maybe a gunshot at this point) and when she is safe he finally dies, but by then the movie was basically over. <br /><br />The acting is horrible, the dialog was terrible, and most scenes are in the desert. The characters are not very likable, and did I mention that it is painfully long??<br /><br />My friend and I started drinking through half the film, and even that didn't improve it! <br /><br />It would have been more entertaining to light my money on fire and watch it burn. <br /><br />And the end was worse than anything. The revelation of who the firstborn were was so anticlimactic! I hated this movie. <br /><br />Now my movie standard has changed-when I see a bad movie, the least I can say for it is "Well...it wasn't as bad as Tower of the Firstborn".
