From Hell.<br /><br />As you will have read from the other reviews From Hell' tells the story of London police inspector Abberline (Depp) and his investigation of Jack the Ripper in Victorian times. Based on a series of graphic novels by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, From Hell' manages to incorporate a lot of genuine Ripper theories and suspects before settling on the most grandiose as its final resolution. <br /><br />This well may prove to be an unpopular view but I did not enjoy From Hell'. My main criticism of From Hell' is that it is so tedious. I would consider myself to be a film viewer of reasonable intelligence, I do not feel that From Hell' would be better with a series of action scenes. But let's not go too far in the opposite direction and confuse an intelligent approach with being boring. And lets not beat around the bush, From Hell' is boring.<br /><br />It is not without its plus points. Depp is watchable as Abberline although Abberline is far less interesting than Depp's similar character in Sleepy Hollow. The accents are not as noticeably bad as in the trailer.<br /><br />But these points are far outweighed by the poorer aspects. For most of these, I am afraid we must look to the directors. Brave as though the Hughes boys were to move into a new field of film making, for the most part the film is never terribly interesting to look at and worse, often treats the viewer as an idiot by showing us close ups and reminders of things that happened moments ago. The sliding realities that occur to Abberline and to the Ripper are cliched and often seem to make little sense.<br /><br />Reading the other reviews on IMDB Andrew Johnson hits the nail on the head when he says there is no emotional involvement with any of the characters, especially the Unfortunates (whores), and it is this dis-attachment that finally kills From Hell' off.<br /><br />The reveal of who the ripper is, will come of no surprise to anyone, although the depth of the conspiracy is interesting. I am not wishing to show off but I had a fairly good idea from the trailer.<br /><br />There is one theory that none of From Hell' actually takes place, it is all the opium fantasy of Abberline. If this was the case then why on earth is it such a lifeless, uneventful time.
