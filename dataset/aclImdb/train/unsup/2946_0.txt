For starters, Ed Wood has been de-throned! Hide and Creep is by far one of the all time worst films ever made. This movie is proof that the only thing good coming out of the deep south is the northbound train! Hide and Creep is what you get when you give a couple of hillbillies a camera. This movie was chock full of crappy acting, editing, art direction and so much more. In some scenes I had to turn up the volume so I could hear the stupid banter (obviously, these actors were not properly "miked." These guys sadly believed that they were spewing great dialog. It was embarrassingly bad at best. If you threw camera equipment into the Gorilla Pit at the zoo, you'd wind up with a BETTER produced film. The folks that made Hide and Creep must have literally yanked some distributor to get this waste of good film stock into the rental stores. This film should come with a warning: "Watch Only if you have the I.Q. of a head of lettuce."
