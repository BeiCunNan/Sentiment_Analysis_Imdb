Never have I been so disgusted that Hollywood would put out such foul material. Although I have never read Jack Ketchum the idea of even writing or filming a story of this nature is revolting!<br /><br />Torture against children is a serious and horrible issue that should be made aware of but this movie is beyond educating people about abuse.<br /><br />But the most upsetting thing in this film is the fact that children were used in the film doing and saying things that no parent should allow.<br /><br />Unfortunately money seemed more enticing to the parents which is an abuse itself! How any person could even let their child pretend to abuse another child in this way is disgusting!!! I will make a habit of never watching Gregory Wilson's movies in the future seeing that I could not finish this one!
