If you love Joan, like I love Joan, you have to see this movie. The script, costumes, acting, and music are all A++++. This has to be the baddest girl that Joan has ever played, and the part suits her well; Mildred Pearce pales in comparison to this role. Barry Sullivan is terrific too. Somehow, I get the impression that during the whole picture that Joan is thinking, "I'll show that Bette how to play a southern vixen!" This movie is the reason that I like old movies; they spent money on this one - the scenery, furnishings, costumes, and jewelry were all "old school" and to die for. If you see the DVD, the original trailer is a hoot! I fell out laughing looking at the trailer after watching the movie. They show way too much of the plot in the trailer, so don't watch the trailer before watching the movie.
