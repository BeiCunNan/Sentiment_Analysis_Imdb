okay this is a very funny show i remember when i first saw it i could not stop laughing but i after a while i had hear all the jokes and it was starting to get lame. <br /><br />and on top of that it was rude..i felt bad because they would get more and more personal to the person that they are up against.<br /><br />i don't know maybe that is just me but yeah this show is just plain and simple unoriginal and not very entertaining. i think the person who created this show is just stupid..the host is a complete idiot who cannot act on that 70's show and to be honest it sucks!!!<br /><br />some of the jokes were original and very funny..but i watched it on MTV..and they would censor some of the stuff that the audience in the show would crack up at..and we could not hear it<br /><br />i cant stand this show and im glad it got canceled..
