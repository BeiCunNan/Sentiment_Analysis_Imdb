i watched the film last night for the first time and i was was impressed by it. i myself grew up watching Schindlers list. I don't normally enjoy many historically themed films anymore but i think this one was a good take on the subject. yes the main character went back in time but it just show how much my generation takes for granted. for example in the film she wanted a tattoo when she got one in the camp it had a completely different negative meaning. also she wanted to be with her friends the past made her realise how much she needed her family. on another not i did notice the woman in the film in the red jumper, is it just me or does this correlate with the young girl in Schindlers list?
