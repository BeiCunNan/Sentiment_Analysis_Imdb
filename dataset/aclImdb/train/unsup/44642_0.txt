If your a big fan of the first movie this isn't the movie for you, its nearly as good as the first one. Bad cast members, bad story=bad movie. I didn't laugh even once throughout the whole movie, I couldn't even stand enough to watch the WHOLE movie! I guess its true that people only make sequels for the money.
