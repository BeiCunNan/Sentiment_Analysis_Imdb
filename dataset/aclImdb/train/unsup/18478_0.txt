First let me state that I am a 30 something male who generally does not like chick flicks. I have not seen any other version nor read the book.<br /><br />The mini-series is just perfect. It is a fantastic love story that is witty, charming, and very funny. I am not sure how many times I have watched it now, at least 5, and it improves with each viewing. The story and characters are so rich and interesting and the acting is just superb. I have a Top Ten list of movies/shows based on the premise that you are stuck on an island and can only bring 10 movies with you to watch for the rest of your life. This version of Pride and Prejudice has a permanent spot on that list. I rarely give 9s when voting here and I give this a 10! <br /><br />If you like period pieces, good acting, or a great love story then this is a must see!
