I was eleven when I saw this in theaters, okay. What I remember is the basics ... Hulk Hogan at that time was Mr. Wrestling. Slamming people around the WWF with unchecked joy. He was the thee man in wrestling. Kids everywhere loved him and this was one of his movie ventures I was fortunate, or unfortunate, to see. There's something about aliens, Hogan befriends a little boy and Christopher Lloyd is the bumbling father. Close enough?<br /><br />I'm surprised I remember that much. I shutter to think as a young boy, I considered this a good movie. It's like reliving the past all over again. God I used to love McDonalds back then too. So who knows maybe in another twenty years, I'll go back and rent a copy of this movie, buy a few quarter pounders and sit back and revive old times. That is of course assuming I'm still alive, a print of the film exists and McDonalds continues to pump out Quarter Pounders like no tomorrow. I can only hope for such luck. For now this movie stays a relic of my boyhood past and for good reason.
