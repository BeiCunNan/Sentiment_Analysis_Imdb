I saw it in 1969 and will never forget it.<br /><br />The cast was a fine cross section of the best Pommie comedy actors of the period.<br /><br />The sight of Marty Feldman in a nurses uniform with Crossed Bandoliers of syringes was surpassed only by Harry Secombes ode to the Pin Up.<br /><br />Would love to get it on Video - Does anyone know how we can get it onto CD, Video, whatever.
