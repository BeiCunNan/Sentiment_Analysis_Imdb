Cast in Gray is an extraordinarily poetic work. Every aspect of it, from the narrative conception to the sense of movement to the editing and (not least) the cinematography, strikes a stunning balance between dazzling clarity and a vague dreamy quality. I found myself clinging passionately to its every moment. How rare that a film nowadays can carry off such daring lyricism, holding us in the cup of its hand with an absolute minimum of dialog, incident, cutting, scenic variety, or any of the other strategies utilized to make films move along. There is a tough-minded discipline to this film that gives it enormous credibility. But it is also a heartbreakingly kind and gentle film. It is truly not to be missed.
