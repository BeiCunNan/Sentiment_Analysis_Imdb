I really liked the movie. The only thing I didn't like was the actual town, Halloweentown, because it was smaller. It was just the pumpkin in the middle and some buildings around it. That was really boring and not as special as the first one. That could have been better.I didn't like that at all. It should have been like the 1st one a big town and with more depth that really sucked. But other than that I really liked the acting and the script. I really love the costumes and the cool special effects. They might not be as good as some other movies but is really interesting and fun. Kids will love this movie. Especially kids that were born in October or even November. The whole series is great and fun for the whole family.
