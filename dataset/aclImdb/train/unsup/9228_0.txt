I caught this movie at its premiere at the Seattle Film Festival and it totally ROCKED MY WORLD.<br /><br />Great story. Funny jokes. Cool techniques. But what really impressed me was its INTELLIGENCE.<br /><br />Here was a movie that was actually about something. Actually it was about a lot of things: anarchy, freedom, group-think, sexual politics, and what it means to just be yourself and do your own thang.<br /><br />Alot of the scenes were LAUGHOUTLOUD FUNNY. Good old fashioned sharp dialogue and hilarious situations. Just when you thought you knew where it was going, it took a bizarre twist that totally shook up your expectations. And while the movie gets progressively darker and darker, it takes a while for you to realize it because the journey is so fun.<br /><br />Obviously this movie didn't have a budget, but it always looked really good -- without looking polished. You could tell they thought alot about the editing and the sound, because both stood out above 99.99% of other indie flicks.<br /><br />HUNT THIS MOVIE DOWN at a film festival or wherever and see it.<br /><br />It will rock your world.<br /><br />
