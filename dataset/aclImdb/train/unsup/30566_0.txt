Yami no Matsuei is my all time favorite anime and manga. All the characters are well rounded and fascinating, especially the leads Tsuzuki and Hisoka. Both grew up in painful circumstances but through each other, are able to start healing. Some of the most beautiful and tragic scenes I'd ever witnessed are the ones between Tsuzuki and Hisoka. I actually cried at the end of volume 4 when Hisoka begged Tsuzuki to live for him. It was such a gorgeous moment because I knew without a doubt that these two really do love each other. One of the best villains, in my opinion, appears in this series. Dr. Muraki has to be the coldest and evilest man out there. There are no redeeming qualities about him but he's so fascinating. The connection/bond between Muraki and Hisoka is one of the most intriguing aspects of the show/manga. When Muraki raped and cursed Hisoka, he set upon him a seemingly unbreakable bond between them. Its rather horrifying how the most visually stunning scene in the anime is the rape scene. But what's brilliant about it is that its all done in Muraki's pov. He romanticizes the rape because he is a romantic. He's a sick romantic but nonetheless, he is one. But this is what makes him such a compelling villain. This is a definite must see for those who love great characters, great story lines and beautiful animation.
