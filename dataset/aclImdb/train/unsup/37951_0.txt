This is nothing more than just another Texas Chainsaw Massacre ripoff, but wait...<br /><br />Although this is really nothing more than what would seem to be an outright ripoff, there are some awesomely freaky implementations which elevate this beyond the label of ripoff. And, while I know it's common place as pie to take someone else's brain child and "improve" upon it until it resembles something original and creative, the improvements and innovations here ARE creative and original.<br /><br />Is it worth your time? That depends on your level and personal tastes within the horror genre, and specifically the slasher/serial murderer sub-genres. You will have to judge that one for yourself.<br /><br />Frankly, I'm a fan of both sub-genres and still hated this, because it's still a ripoff, and as such, rates a 4.4/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
