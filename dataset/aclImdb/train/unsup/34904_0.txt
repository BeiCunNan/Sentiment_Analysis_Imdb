I've never felt the need to write one of these reviews but I feel the need to save others from my fate. I read the book a few months ago and enjoyed it as much as any other Crichton book. I was interested but not too surprised that they made a movie about it and was intrigued by the possibilities so I rented it to see what they had done with the book. They did not do well. Do NOT watch this movie. You cannot get the wasted hours back. They decided to take out all of the interesting parts of the book and, even worse, they used that terrible actor from the Fast and the Furious movies. Not only can he not act, but he certainly can't pull off the even minor emotional changes necessary for the role. I emplore you, find something else to watch and if you feel the need to hear the story, read the book, it doesn't take any longer than the movie, but it, at least, is worthwhile.
