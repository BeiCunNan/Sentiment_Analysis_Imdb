Narrated by Eric Stoltz, who plays a man who has lived his entire life in a small town named Homer. He tells three tales of homophobia and how it is has effected the lives of several Homer citizens. Brittany Murphy is a girl in the navy who is dishonorably discharged after she experiments with another girl. When she returns home, her discharge papers are required for employment and the entire town knows that she's a "queer." Her mother (Margot Kidder) throws her out of the house and she's on her own,left to battle the cruel Homer residents. Jonathan Taylor Thomas stars in the "1974" segment as a homosexual teenager who is taunted by his swimteam and classmates. He seeks guidance from his teacher, played by Steven Weber, whom he suspects is gay. The teacher, however, fears losing his chance at becoming school principle and allows the tormenting to continue. In the final segment, a gay couple tries to marry in Homer with a negative community reaction.<br /><br />"Common Ground" is a nice film about acceptance and tolerance, but it could have definitely done without the scene where Thomas' character is raped orally by a cruel team member. The scene should have been integral to the development of the film, but it just happens, no one speaks of it and the characters forget it ever happened (bad editing, or was it meant that way?) I don't know. That part confused me. But, overall, it was a decent movie, especially for Showtime. 7/10
