Now I'm usually your typical Die-Hard, Guns Blazing, Sword Swinging, Magic Wielding Anime fan! So there shouldn't really be any surprises when I say that "Grave of the Fire Flies" is not ranked among my list of all time favourites. And the prospect of watching it didn't sound too appealing to me at first, considering the rather subdued DVD case cover...(I know, I'm ashamed) <br /><br />That said, this film is a masterpiece of story telling, the calibre of which my current favourite films pale in comparison. I don't think I've ever been more moved by any other films, period!!! I've vowed never to see this film again, as I think revisiting it would lessen the emotional impact of the first viewing. In any case I don't think I need to re-watch it as it's been burned into my memory forever.<br /><br />This is a film that I hate and love at the same time. The beautiful story and the capturing of facial expressions which only a hand drawn animation could fully realise. On the other hand the film reduced me to sobbing wreck, a bitter sweet ending which left me so depressed it took me another two days to get over...<br /><br />Its a must see, but be sure to have lots of tissue paper on hand. I'm temped to say it's a life changing experience, certainly has been for me. The rest I leave to you to decide.
