By far one of the best hardcore thrillers ever made. Lee Frosts Climax is exactly what are hardcore thriller/cop movie should be. Very well acted and exceptionally well directed by genre hag Lee Frost(partner Bob Cresse can be seen in a cameo role as a massage parlor owner)Climax feels like an old Crown International flick, except much better made than any Crown International film ever was. The cast, consisting mainly of unknown actors and actresses for the most part perfectly fit their complex roles(special acknowledgment ought to go to Jason Carns, in the lead, for he is just as convincing as any Hollywood bag guy).Continuity wise there are a few holes and gaps, but they are so small and insignificant that they can be overlooked, and are even forgotten over the course of the entire film. It is a pity that society still looks down and snubs their noses at hardcore cinema, for if this cinematic medium were to ever be accepted,surly films like this would become recognized as the masterpieces they are.
