I've seen this movie twice in the cinema and about 5 times on DVD!I love it sooooooo much!!!!The story is totally original and the acting is brilliant!!!!The special effects,.......I'm speechless!!!Honeswtly people!This is a Swedish movie with special effects like in Matrix or in Die Hard!This is a parody on many American action movies per example:Matrix,Die Hard,Rambo,etc.There is even love in this movie between Jessica(who wants to close local Police station) and Jacob(the policeman).The humor is original,typically Swedish,but still amazing!tHE ACTORS :Torkel Petersson is one of the best Swedish young comics on this time.Josef Fares and Fares Fares are actually Libanons,who moved to Sweden.Whwn Josef was 21,he was accepted to the Swedish Film Academy in Stockholm.He also directed another box office hit,Jalla Jalla,the film I also liked it.In this movie,you can see a brother,Fares Fares and a Father Fares.So this movie is totally Fares family movie and i really recommend it!
