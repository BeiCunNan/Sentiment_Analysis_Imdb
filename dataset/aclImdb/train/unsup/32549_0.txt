OK, the original was cheesy but it was a good movie. the acting was relatively believable, the story was pretty good, it had a plot twist you didn't really see coming. it was a classic. even though the two sequels were even cheesier they were watchable movies and the second one is way underrated in my opinion. which brings us to the latest installment. i paid $19.96 for this piece of garbage, and after having seen it i wouldn't go through the trouble of picking it up if i saw it on the side of the road. how could pastore and hayes agree to be in this film? they musta gotten paid good money. i've seen better acting in elementary school plays. seriously. words can't describe how awful this movie was. and the "plot twist" was something i saw coming from the very beginning. i didn't have the greatest expectations for this but at least expected it to be as good as the third movie and i was terribly disappointed. there aren't many good things to say about this movie. no standout performances. not a whole lot to redeem the rest. and i'm not one of those bitter people who woulda hated it reguardless since it completely ignored parts two and three. i just call it like i see it.
