HBO is renowned for their excellent original programming. Recently, the premier cable channel has gotten into historical drama with the excellent "Elizabeth I" and "Rome." Ever the copycat, Showtime now offers "The Tudors," combining the time period of "Elizabeth I" and the format of "Rome." Too bad it has none of the quality. Where "Elizabeth I" had gravitas, "The Tudors" is deadly dull. Where "Rome" was risqu√© and shocking, "The Tudors" is just empty-headed and smarmy. It was difficult not to change the channel on this show in the first ten minutes; I cannot imagine plodding through an entire droning, silly season of this. HBO's programs are the products of creators genuinely keen on their subjects and time periods, while this plodding, vapid Showtime program is another lame attempt to mimic a rival's glory.
