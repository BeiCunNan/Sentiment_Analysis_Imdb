The cameo by the man behind the Jim Rome show, aka the Jungle, is enough to put this movie right up there with the greatest of all time. Move over Citizen Kane, watch out Godfather and the heck with you Schindler's list, it's all about Call Me! There's a new star in Tinsel-town and he is J-Stew. Forget the "rat pack" it's the XR4-TI Crew's time now! '"Ivan, Ivan! One more!" I haven't seen a performance like that since Dustin Hoffman played Charlie Babbit in Rain Man. And the method acting was incredible. Jamie-Lynn and Robert Davi were completely upstaged by this up and coming future superstar. It's only fitting that J-stew portrayed a member of the paprazzi because surely he is going to be hounded by them for the rest of his natural life. War Call Me! War J-Stew for an Oscar. I am out!
