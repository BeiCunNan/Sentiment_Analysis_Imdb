Dead Life (2005) was an interesting film. Unlike most of these independent films that are popping up all over the place at my local video store, this one was shot on film (well Super 8) and the results were mixed. But one scene in this movie made it for me. A chemical accident involving the main character's father has traumatized him for the longest time. Years later, we find the dude restore the family homestead with the help of his friends. But a strange virus has swept across his home town turning the residents into the "living dead".<br /><br />The movie itself is okay. But there's a scene in it that makes it worth watching. It involves a head banger and a local "girl". Drop a few bucks and rent it. To describe it would be too telling. A watchable "survival horror" film. I recommend this movie for bad movie fans as well. I just wished the director would shoot on 16mm or digital video next time. It was cool to see a movie on film but it's not necessary anymore. Super 8 is as dead as the dinosaur.<br /><br />Recommended.
