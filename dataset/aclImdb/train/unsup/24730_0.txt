This film opened in this country recently, right after another prison massacre in Brazil, where inmates were killed after they rioted.<br /><br />Hector Babenco's film is a sad commentary on society's failure to turn these criminals in jail, into law abiding citizens. If anything, this film could be a vivid reminder to law breaking people about what they can expect when they have to pay their debt and must serve time under conditions such as the one we see in Carandiru prison.<br /><br />Add to that the horrible conditions of jails in certain parts of the world. Any would be criminal should think twice about the consequence of their actions. Landing in a penal institution is a hellish experience, at best. How can lawmakers of the world think that a criminal mind will be changed by sending them to places such as Carandiru? If anything, placing these criminals with other criminals in such conditions will perpetuate crime and if the prisoner survives the term, he will be scarred for life.<br /><br />Not having read the book in which this film is based, it is only fair to say that Mr. Babenco, an excellent director, has given us a realistic film about what hell must be like.
