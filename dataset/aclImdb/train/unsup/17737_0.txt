Boy did this movie suck. And not in that bad movie/campy way that I thought it would. It took itself much too serious. And having Farrah Fawcett play a women who is the world's most successful actress/singer? The scene where she is recording a song is too funny. She's suppose to be this huge pop singer and the song was really lame, and obviously it was not her singing. And Fawcett, even though shot through tons of gauze, was certainly not looking her best, but everyone kept saying how she was soooo beautiful and talented and gorgeous. And her "acting" in this movie was atrocious. She has the same look for pensive, fearful, angry, happy and contemplative. It's like, "I'm so sad, look at my pretty, curly, blond hair.<br /><br />And the rest of the cast is no better. Robin Givens is the self centered diva, but really has nothing to do except have lunch with the other characters, act like Samantha on Sex in the City, and realize at the end how much she really loves her daughter. Boring!<br /><br />And Melissa Gilbert can't act either. She looks good but that's it. And her storyline was the only one that was somewhat interesting/funny. This movie might of been a little better if they got rid of the lame kidnapping storyline. I thought this movie would be about the lives of the famous and wealthy in Hollywood, but the last part of it looked like a cheesy Diagnosis Murder episode. And it's painful to watch Farrah try to act like she's upset.
