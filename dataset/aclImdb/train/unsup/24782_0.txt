Julie Delpy, the talented actress of "2 Days in Paris" surprises with this tale of a pair of lovers at a crucial moment of their relationship. Ms. Delpy, who wrote and directed the film shows how well she has learned the lessons of being in front of the camera. The end result is a delightful film that owes a lot to previous films where she has appeared.<br /><br />Throughout the movie one felt the presence of Richard Linkletter, who directed her in two films that bear some resemblance to this one, and Woody Allen, in the way Ms. Delpy presents the character of Jack, her lover of two years. Jack, a New York neurotic, feels out of his usual turf. In a way, he is totally overwhelmed by the life Marion, his girlfriend, has left behind for a life in America.<br /><br />Julie Delpy plays Marion wearing thick black eyeglasses that hide her beautiful face in a way we are not used to see her in movies. She plays the straight part against the goofy Jack of Adam Goldberg. Mr. Goldberg has some good moments when he is at his nastiest, like with the group of tourists he misdirects in order to get ahead of them in the taxi queue. <br /><br />One hopes Ms. Delpy will come with another film in a not too distant future for she shows a natural ability to set a pleasant story in an enjoyable way.
