World of Warcraft gives blizzard a bad name in my eyes. Even though new races and weapons have been added to the Warcraft series it still gets boring and annoying.<br /><br />World of Warcraft just brainwashes kids (and adults) into nothingness, i mean come on haven't you seen the south park episode.<br /><br />What was blizzard thinking? they made millions off a stupid game. I can't wait until blizzard come to their senses and make Warcraft IV. Blizzard if you read this take my advice, i'm not the only one that thinks this.<br /><br />It is so bad i would only recommend it to my worst enemy. Thats a great present for someone you hate. Everyone has an enemy, thats probably where blizzard made all their money off this game.<br /><br />2/10
