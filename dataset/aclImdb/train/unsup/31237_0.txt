How can there be screenwriters when this film doesn't even have a real plot? Charles Grodin plays George, a guy who sells chairs for a living. He tells his best client that he is fat and the client takes his business elsewhere. The owner of the business is furious and George decides it's a good time to go on vacation. He takes his family to some fleabag "resort" that he knows nothing about. Let the laughs begin! Heh.<br /><br />All of the employees at the resort are strange and/or gay. The employees that Phil Hartman and Mario Van Peebles play are both homosexuals for the sole purpose of having Grodin's character show his disdain for them. Throw in Jon Lovitz and Megan Mullally and you would think that the supporting cast alone would at least make this watchable. You would be so, SO wrong to assume that though.<br /><br />Well, I guess I can wrap this up already since there isn't much to discuss in terms of the "plot". George and his wife smoke some pot, his wife also takes some hallucinogenic mushrooms, a few women take their tops off and everything culminates in a massive shootout with some rebel guerrillas...or something. Did I mention that this takes place around Christmas? Sorry, it's easy to forget since it is specifically pointed out at the beginning of the film and then virtually ignored for the rest of the story. My advice to you is to ignore this entire film. 1/10
