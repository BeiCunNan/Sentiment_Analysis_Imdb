Terry Moore stars in this tripe about a rich kid who fakes his own kidnapping in order to get attention from Mummy and Daddykins. But Terry Moore remains the only reason to watch. Let's see, what else? <br /><br />There are some cool Mercedes-Benzes..... um..... the palm trees in Beverly Hills are very pretty..... uh..... *zzzzzzz* - oh, sorry!<br /><br />Did I mention Terry Moore?! - yeah, I did. Well, that's about it. Let's review, shall we? The reasons to watch this movie are:<br /><br />1. Terry Moore, 2. cool Mercedes-Benzes, 3. pretty palm trees<br /><br />There. We're done. That wasn't so bad, was it? A bit of advice, though. If you are planning on watching this, get totally blitzed first. At least then you won't be able to remember it the next day.
