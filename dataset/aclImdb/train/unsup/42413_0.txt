This one has to be seen to be believed. In what is easily one of the worst "films" I ever saw - it hardly deserves to be mentioned as such -, Nazi bikers, Kung Fu fighters and hardcore pornography mix up. The plot is so unbelievably dull it seriously raises the question of how story lines like these can actually be turned into a movie. Who would ever finance or produce crap like this? Obviously, someone was in for it here. Perhaps the strangest thing are the numerous male nude scenes. Nothing is veiled and all details are explicit - entirely without reason, excerpt for the dare itself. Not to forget the Nazi symbolism that is present throughout the film with the evil biker dudes. Inevitably that is also used for a sexual encounter, and it's one that's more than strange. In total a film that may be suitable for punishment and torture of true lovers of cinema. If possible, I'd give it zero out of ten points - probably less.
