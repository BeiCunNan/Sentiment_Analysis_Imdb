Audie Murphy is one of the nation's most beloved souls, not only as an actor, but his exploits on the battlefront during WWII, becoming the most decorated soldier in history, and rising far in the military at the tender age of 19 made him an inspiration for us all. To Hell and Back is his story.<br /><br />A true story based on Murphy's autobiography, THaB is beyond its time in that the visuals are absolutely stunning for a movie made in 1955. When watching it for the first time, I thought it was made in the late 1960's or early 1970's. Audie Murphy provides a realistic and moving performance as himself. The film is not only about Murphy's exploits in the war, but the people he met and became great friends with. It also shows the sorrow and tragedy of war very well, throwing in some romantic moments here and there, which is nice relief from all the action. What you'll realize about Murphy's performance is how real it is, because it's a rare moment in movies when someone plays themselves in an actual moment that changed their lives.<br /><br />Go watch this great war movie. It's a classic that all war films should definitely take reference from. You'll have a good time with it, guaranteed.<br /><br />8/10 --spy
