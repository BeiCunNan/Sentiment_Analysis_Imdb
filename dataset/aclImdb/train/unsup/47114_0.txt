I would say the end of the movie was not believable.<br /><br />I was a bit afraid to have Ben Affleck as Ryan. I 've seen the the other two movie with Harrison Ford. I would say he was credible as a young Ryan.<br /><br />The part showing the work at the CIA and Ryan trying tho show its views was good. The Russians were schematically played by the actor. It looks like they just went out of their caverns. Still the cold war vision.<br /><br />The end starting from the explosion was non believable. Having the president of the United States starting a nuclear war with just the opinion of four persons in a plane look unbelievable to me. I press or I press not the button? Bah ok I press it. And zou no more earth.<br /><br />Vincent (Belgium)
