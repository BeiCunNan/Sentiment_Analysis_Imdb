I would have preferred that they never made it as it is such a mess. I do wonder though what they could do with todays special effects and computer graphics? If anyone had never seen a Bruce Lee film and then saw this, they would wonder what all the fuss was about. Even some of the footage used was probably not the final scenes Bruce would have used. He was very good at camera angles and editing and this film falls flat on both those counts. There was also much more footage available that never made it into this film, just why I do now know (Check out the documentary called 'Bruce Lee: A Warriors Journey' and you will see more action that was meant for this film.) It would have been better to have never made Game of Death and most Bruce fans have it simply to fast forward to seeing the parts that he was actually in.
