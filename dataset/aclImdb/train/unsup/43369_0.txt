Uggh!!! This movie is a wonderful example of a movie and movie executives with no soul (or brains for that matter). Peter Sellers, the original Clouseau died and some nitwits decided this shouldn't stop them from doing another Pink Panther movie. This may not have been that bad a decision, but they also decided to have it feature Sellers as Clouseau!!! Now, the way around this was to take clips and outtakes from the previous films and intersperse them in a new and completely contrived plot.<br /><br />Why couldn't they just give it a rest and STOP making these movies?!?! The only positive thing about this film was that the film bombed, as the public was not about to be hoodwinked into paying to see this pile of crap!
