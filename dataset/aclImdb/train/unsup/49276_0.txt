The first time I saw the trailer for this film was about year ago inside a movie house. It showed a lot of promise, I was even mesmerized as it used Josh Groban's Mi Mancherai to great effect which left the viewer with such a teaser that I could not wait to know more about the film and its plot. Soon after wards a lot of internet hype went into this film based upon the fact that a lot of people are anticipating M. Night Shyamalan's movies. With the lackluster "The Village" as this film's predecessor it was time to look into a refreshing albeit familiar direction one expects of M. Night and after a year or so of waiting I finally saw it tonight. It is by far, the most unimaginative of all of M. Night Shyamalan's films and to me the most self-indulgent. Most of the time the film seems to be trying too hard to put that mystery and suspense that it feels contrived. I have also noticed a shift in his story telling style particularly his use of a lot of "Hollywood special effects" instead of the use of natural surroundings to create that distinct Shyamalan style of storytelling suspense which I loved and saw in his previous films. This feels like a sell out film and I think a wee bit egotistical to put himself as an important though not central character instead of his usual cameo appearance. This I think was the most detrimental to an already obtuse storyline. In closing, I think he should go back to the style that he became famous for and not try too hard to get lost in his own myth and persona.
