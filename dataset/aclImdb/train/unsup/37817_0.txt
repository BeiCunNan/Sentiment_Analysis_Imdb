Nine months may not be the worst movie in the world but, it didn't make very much of an impression on me. The humor is all slapstick-so Much slapstick-that I found annoying rather then funny. Hugh and Julianne have been much better in other roles, in fact I don't like Julianne as a comedic actress, her forte is definitely drama. There are a million movies around like this and I happen to be a fan of predictable romantic comedies(if their good) but I found the characters and humor very weak and even though the movie's not DECADES old or anything it looks dated now, especially the hairstyles. I wouldn't call this terrible but I wouldn't call it interesting either and all these wonderful incredible talented performers have done their best work elsewhere.
