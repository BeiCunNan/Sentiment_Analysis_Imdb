It's refreshing to see a movie that has very little sentimental value, but where the villains get exactly what they deserve. Gwyneth Paltrow is outstanding as the heroine who has an affair with an ill-advised lover. Michael Douglas, trying to avoid being typecast as the rich business tycoon he has played a lot of recently, is now a rich business tycoon who tries to kill his wife. The plot, though not entirely believable, at least made some sense, no small triumph in today's mystery/thriller genre. I understand that this film is a re-make of a Hitchcock movie, but unlike many, this one was a worthwhile effort.
