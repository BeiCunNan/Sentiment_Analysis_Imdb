"In The Woods" is a startling film. It is startling that anything this atrocious was actually released onto DVD. The "film" features the absolute worst acting, worst sound, and worst special effects this reviewer has seen in a movie in years (and he has viewed thousands). Now like most of you who enjoy scary movies, he likes to sometimes pick out a title that looks "so bad it's funny". He thought this title might fit the bill one boring weekday night. The problem was, it was bad all right, but it wasn't funny. "In the Woods" is absolutely rotten, plain and simple. Lynn Drzick (who is not a professional, or arguably even an amateur, director), does an astounding job of making this film unbearable by zooming in nice and close while his stone faced cast deliver their lines in some of the most dreadful monotone ever filmed. This movie makes Ed Wood look like Spielberg. I kept wondering if the actors were reading cue cards. At times it was very apparent they were "thinking" about what they had to say next, before finally spitting out their uninspired dialogue. The "monster" is some kind of mutant dog with horns, and is about as scary as a legless Huckleberry Hound. The movie is touted (on the DVD box), as akin to the Blair Witch Project, though it bears no resemblance to that film - it is a blatant, flat-out-obvious rip off of "Relic". This reviewer lived for a time in Western Michigan, the land where this garbage was filmed. Western Michigan is a pretty area, with good people and lots of great recreation and theater. Please don't hold this film against them.
