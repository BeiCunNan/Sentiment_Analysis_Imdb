better than a City of god. what a movie ma man? ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha... what i have notice in this Serbian movies is: brother will do everything for the brother.<br /><br />Croatian is the best ha ha ha - what a lover guy?! Great twist on the end! But also why they did not fu the singer? the Kurabic girl? they could? The most funny thing is when they shouting memorials at the Grey yard.. i did not get the idea? did they shout the Croatian surnames ha ha ha. Who actually has kill the Kurabic? Production is very good. English subtitles also. Actors are perfect match - no fake - that what I like in the movies.
