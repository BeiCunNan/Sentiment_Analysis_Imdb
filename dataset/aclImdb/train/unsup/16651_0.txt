I see where some people did not much care for this movie. That's the way it is with comedies. Not everyone has the same sense of humor.<br /><br />I liked it.<br /><br />I found Martin's character to be very entertaining. His constant stream of BS is very entertaining. I know it's comedy, so I am not like those people who felt a more traditional gangster actor would have been better. It's his very silly over the top style which I found endearing.<br /><br />Moranis is OK. He's too typecast for me, always playing a similar role. I thought he was maybe funnier in ghost busters. I don't know. He's a decent actor. It's that whole square role he plays that gets to me a bit. He's supposed to be boring, obviously. But he's maybe too boring.<br /><br />I found the female cop love interest for Martin to be great. She's cute and she's funny.<br /><br />Joan Cusack...I have liked her better in other roles. She's hilarious in Grosse Pointe Blank. She's OK in this role.<br /><br />I liked the silent film style "captions, or whatever you would call them a lot. They added humor to the movie.<br /><br />In summary, I found the movie very light, very entertaining, and cute. I like that type of movie. If you want something that requires no thought, where your goal as a viewer is just to relax and be amused, this is perfect.
