I was really surprised how this movie gives a real view on lesbian lives over 3 decades in all its three parts. The moving story of this elderly lesbian losing her lover and walking through a breakdown of her life, the love story between a "butch" and a kind of a "hippie" lesbian and the very funny story how to get pregnant if a lesbian couple wants to become mothers. All the parts were played excellent by the actresses and showed an intensiveness which - I'm sure of that - could be felt not only by lesbians or gay people. This movie is a highlight in US-TV and it would be my wish that some day we will see this one also in German TV.
