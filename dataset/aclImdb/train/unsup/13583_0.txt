This movie was a joyful and moving experience for me. It was so profoundly moving that by the end I wondered why it took me nine years to get around to seeing it! There wasn't much fanfare about this movie when it played in theaters, probably because of its languid pace and its romantic atmosphere. It is a movie about a robot's search for an identity, but at the same time it is about love, aging, individuality, and even greed. The movie also succeeds in creating spellbinding images of the weddings and the romantic dances. It was also exciting to watch the visions of the world in the 22nd and 23rd centuries but at the same time, the nuts and bolts aspects were deftly restrained (other movies set years in the future, such as The Fifth Element sometimes go gaudily overboard in depicting the future). Andrew's romance with Portia was also touching and believable though I did not think about this while the movie ran. Overall, this is one of the best science fiction movies I have ever seen and one of Robin William's best performances. I would love to read an interview with him about it. He would probably say that the performance was exhilarating but emotionally exhausting.
