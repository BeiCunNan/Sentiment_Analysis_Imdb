I was trying to compose a list of the ten worst films ever for my school newspaper. My list was composed of the usual films (i.e. Battle Field Earth, etc.). But it was when my friend gave me this film that I was forced to rethink my existance. This film is terrible. Never in my life have I ever heard such terrible dialogue as "Who did this...no...don't tell me. I know. I have known all along." This trite and painful story is not even worthy of the boys from MST3K! Avoid this film at all costs! So to answer the question, it was at number three.
