I like low-budget horror-flicks. A lot. But this movie is just plain crap. No charm, no heart, nothing. Some low-budget horror movies are cool because you can tell that the people who made it really has an interest in the genre, and that they love what they do, but the people who made this probably decided to make a horror movie because it's cheap, went out and rented a bunch of old old classics, and started filming without much of a plan. The "story" is so paper thin it makes most horror movies look like Oscar material. No cool gore at all. I thought I might give it a 2 since they obviously had no budget at all, but it's just to bad for a 2. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Avoid
