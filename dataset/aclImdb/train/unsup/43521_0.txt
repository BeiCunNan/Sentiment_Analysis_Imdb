it's an awful film, the story is good but i think the director didn't know what to do with it, the nudity was just there to show naked actors with out justifying it, the style of the movie the camera the acting the music, it did not mesh well it was just a lot of ingredients thrown in the air not coming together at all, the story seems like it has potential but with a better director maybe, or just somebody with the right vision could have done a good job with this... The wolf in the movie has more personality then all the characters in the film and the only believable character is the crazy kids sister who is also in love with the best friend. The ex girlfriends character was just bizarre, she acts crazy for no reason, or at least we never see how good of a relationship she had with the schizo.
