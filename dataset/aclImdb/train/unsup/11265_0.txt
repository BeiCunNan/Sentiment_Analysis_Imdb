London to Brighton is a grim crime film that rolls back the glamorisation of gangsters in Guy Ritchie film and prostitution in Secret Diaries of a Call Girl.<br /><br />The focus of London to Brighton is on Joanna (Georgia Groome) an 12-year-old runaway and Kelly (Lorraine Stanley), a prostitute. Both are on the run after killing a gangster and his son Stuart (Sam Spruell) is out for revenge. Joanna and Kelly run off to Brighton and Stuart demands that their pimp Derek (Johnny Harris) find them and contact him as soon as he does. Whilst in Brighton Joanna gets a chance to be child again but Kelly has to raise money and does it the only way she can, selling herself. As well Joanna and Kelly becomes stronger as the film continues.<br /><br />This film looks at dark themes such as prostitution and paedophilia. The film was well handled by the first time writer/director Paul Andrew Williams. He shows that he has talent and a bright future ahead of him. The acting was of a high standard especially from Georgia Groome who also has a promising career ahead of her. In the film there are characters that you actually care about and you want to know what happens to them. There was a subtle use of music and the direction was strong, using the techniques of social realism. The only criticism is that I think is that I more could been found out about Kelly's and Derek's pasts.<br /><br />London to Brighton is a grim view, but a worthy film.
