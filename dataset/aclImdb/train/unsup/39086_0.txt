I preferred the original, it was much more gripping. There's not a lot<br /><br />of great acting here, with the exceptions of Harvey Keitel and Brian<br /><br />Dennehy. Everyone else seems to be posing up a storm, like they cast a<br /><br />bunch of models, led by Gorgeous George Clooney, still tilting his head<br /><br />and smirking as though that made a character come to life. I was<br /><br />disappointed by this and angry that they remade a great movie into a<br /><br />ho-hum one. Skip it.
