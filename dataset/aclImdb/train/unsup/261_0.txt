I find this move to be very short on charm, long on forced acting, short on authenticity, boringly edited, and low on energy. Robin Williams couldn't act any less gay than his stilted quasi-macho portrayal (emphasizing only one aspect of that character to the complete detriment of the other). Nathan Lane certainly has his fey acting abilities in tact, but he has no one to play against with Williams being as wooden as that living room cross. The other actors play caricatures of their roles in the same silly, stilted and inauthentic way as Williams. Tedious, with only a couple of truly funny moments. The lovely costuming and sets are totally wasted on this unemotionally nuanced affair. This movie's main purpose is to highlight why the 1978 La Cage version was so far more authentic and superior in every possible way.
