I saw the movie because I'm a Keira Knightley fan and in that respect it was good, she brings a great performance as usual. Really there is nothing that I can say is bad about the acting or the movie in general other than it isn't my favorite kind of movie. In a phrase "it was messed up". If you like thrillers and mysteries then this is your kind of movie. It may seem a bit predictable at times, but it is well written and gives some unexpected turns. The movie takes place in a past tense with flashes of memory as everyone tries to figure out what happened, including the audience. If you ever get the chance to watch this movie it won't disappoint you, its a good way to pass the time. But if you don't ever watch it, you aren't missing much.
