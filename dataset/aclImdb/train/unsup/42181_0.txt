This is one of the worst movie I have ever watched in my entire life. Here, penguins have been abused and insulted by showing them as if they are foul mouthed loathsome creatures. Here are some of the major faults of the movie: 1) They have insulted a masterpiece documentary 'March of the penguins' by inserting all kinds of vulgarity in language and have insulted love by showing it just as fun, and I abhor them for this.<br /><br />2) It looked as if the editor had pasted scenes of other movies in between the movie. eg. the owl 3) There was a conversation about global problem, about friendship and what not. I could not decipher the main plot of the film.<br /><br />4) Samuel Jackson is shown to explain about the penguins nicely in the start but then he messes it all up by using foul words on them.<br /><br />5) The voicing were terrible. It was like a monologue, no voice modulation in showing different emotions.<br /><br />I think the director should be sued for making such a film. Its pathetic to watch and rubbish to listen.
