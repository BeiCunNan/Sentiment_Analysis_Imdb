This B picture from Warner Brothers casts Loretta Young and Winnie Lightner as pair of shopgirls who both work for Guy Kibbee as a supervisor. Winnie plays up to Kibbee who's doing one of his patented old rogue characters. But Loretta is looking for something with a little more excitement and thinks she's found it in Norman Foster.<br /><br />The problem is that while Loretta thinks she's married to a high living salesman, she's really marrying a very high living gambler. And when two might turn into three a crisis ensues.<br /><br />Play-Girl runs exactly an hour which clearly puts it in the B category. Loretta and the cast do breathe some life into it, she's just beautiful and Lightner is cast in parts that Ruth Donnelly or Patsy Kelly would be playing in a higher grade film. What happens to Loretta in the film is just plain ridiculous and how Foster is redeemed is even more so. <br /><br />But if you love Loretta Young than you must see this film. Her beauty literally carries it.
