I've replayed this wonderful movie so many times that I think I've memorized the script. The nuances in it, the performances of even the bit players, and the direction are incredible. Examples (without screwing this up for you -- and I hope I' ve got the correct actors' names for the parts): defense attorney Lane Smith's confident rapping of fingers on the desk as he departs from his abysmal defense opening; prosecutor Austin Pendleton calculated pronouncement of heinous "hy-eee-nus"; the grits cook's (Maury Chaykin?) blank testimony; the tough guy -- Chris Ellis? -- in his confrontations with Vinny; and the incredible southern judge Fred Gwynne who is irresistible with his fancy southern/back east background against Vinny's Brooklyn approach; and Marisa Tomei's incredible performance such as telling Vinny "you blend" and "the baby deah is drinking from the little brook and BAM...". No, this is a great movie and I can't let comments that it's anything less go unanswered.
