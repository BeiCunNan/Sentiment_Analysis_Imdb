i watched this movie last night. I thought that I was going to be a little bit thrilled like the first XXX movie I saw. Vin Diesel was great, and you could tell he wasn't being a poser either. I mean the stuff ice cube did in this movie was about impossible, especially for the shape he's in. I mean come on he looks like a burnt marshmallow. At least Vin Diesel could actually do a lot of his stunts in the movie. Also the plot was retarded, and there was way to much 3d animation going in the movie, so it looked really awful, and what was with all the corny romance scenes in this movie??? Pathetic. I love action films just as much as the next guy, but this was a high budget piece of crap if you asked me. Now I thought that Fantastic 4 was the worst movie of the year, but I was wrong. THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!!! I just want to say one more thing, Vin Diesel if you ever read this, just answer me why didn't you star in this movie???? It would of been so much better if you did, instead of them having Xander Cage killed off.
