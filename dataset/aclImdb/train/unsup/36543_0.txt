it's dated but a reasonably good plot. Particularly the first of the 3 episodes is dated and the SFXs are really not good. If you can see past it then it's OK.<br /><br />The age is not the only excuse as 2001 Space Ody is older and better (re SFX).<br /><br />the acting is generally not brilliant but passable.<br /><br />I suppose i liked it a bit but having to watch it for so long spoilt the enjoyment.<br /><br />It probably is debatable whether it is spending money to buy this!<br /><br />It probably could be condensed into a great movie now
