From the bad community theater acting, to the bad script, to the bad direction, to the bad not-so special effects...I found this movie to be the funniest movie I've seen in a really long time.<br /><br />Is it scary? Only if you think that someone out there thought it was a horror movie and marketed it as such.<br /><br />It it even good? Not even decent.<br /><br />I recommend a Friday night viewing over pizza and a six pack. That's the only way to get any enjoyment out of this laughable piece of dung, especially if you spent more than a penny to view it.
