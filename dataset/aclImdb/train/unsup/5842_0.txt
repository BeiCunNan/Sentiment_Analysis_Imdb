I was born and raised in the South. Be assured that, in the renditions of character in "The Apostle," nothing was "over the top". If you want to see a splendid portrayal of the process of redemption in its most elemental form, see The Apostle.<br /><br />"The Apostle" and "L.A. Confidential" tied for best picture of 1997, the fatuously awarded "Titanic" notwithstanding.
