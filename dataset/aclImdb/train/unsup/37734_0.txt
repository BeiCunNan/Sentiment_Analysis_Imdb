We had Cindy on tape as kids but misplaced it when we moved. Has anyone had any success in locating Cindy?? If so please contact me at his_luv23@yahoo.com so that I may obtain a copy. I would love to show this movie to my children as well, To me it is more than a classic but a piece of African-American history. The cast, the set, the music, it was all so invigorating and exciting. I would love to experience this movie again. <br /><br />Hope someone finds Cindy. It is truly a classic.<br /><br />Please if you have any information about how I can get a hold of this movie, I would surely appreciate it.
