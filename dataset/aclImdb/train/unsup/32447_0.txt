Written by Ed Wood of Plan 9 fame, this film centers on a group of girls who run around doing all sorts of criminal shenanigans. The problem is the film is just...boring. Honestly, I got more entertainment out of watching fish then this film.<br /><br />I supposed it was some 50's psycho-drama, but the film opens in one of the worst ways possible. Basically, a very small court room where parents are being a judge who looks oddly like Commissioner Gordon from the Batman comic franchise. From there, it recaps the whole story as one giant flashback, including one of the girls getting impregnated via raping a man (this does happen, but on the whole treated in a very "meh" fashion). Two of the gang die and no one cares, some other stuff happens, and end story.<br /><br />Truth is, the basic technical aspects are good, but they are drowned out by the bad acting, bad script, and bland feeling that makes it seem everyone had other things they'd rather be doing.<br /><br />Going forward, there are worse films from multiple stand points, but otherwise, this does just fall flat. Nothing overly glaring, no outstanding rampaging plot holes, no real issues with production. Just all in all, boring.<br /><br />3/10 stars. There are worse, but avoid this film unless you are drunk and like "bad girls"
