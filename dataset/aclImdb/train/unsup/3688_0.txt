This Was probably the one of the best movies i've ever seen. It is a bit of everything eerie,scary,Psychological, and shocking. When i first saw the tcm i was on the edge of my seat. None of it's sequels can compare to the First tcm and, i heard there making a remake it will be nothing like the original.This was a very good movie and, i recommend it to anyone who's in for a real scare. 10/10
