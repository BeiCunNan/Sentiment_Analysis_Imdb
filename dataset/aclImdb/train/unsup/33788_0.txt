The only redeeming quality this movie could possibly have had was a series of soft core scenes well shot with an eye to detail. That, unfortunately did not happen. The plot, what there is of it, is poorly thought out and does not sustain ones' interest unless you are looking for a primer on how not to script a movie. The actresses are no where near the quality of Kim Dawson or Tane Mc Clure and are never seen satisfyingly naked in the sex scenes, much less from the multiple camera angles one expects from a T&A opus. The company that produced this must have had the idea that they were making a real movie so they used the tease of Mary Carey and the other women to draw viewers who would then be amazed at the quality of the film just watched. It would be so nice if when making a T&A movie, the people responsible would simply make a mindless movie with lots of naked female flesh and leave the really bad film making to Ed Wood. Please do not expect anything from this excrescence other than the loss of hard earned dollars. Go watch Mary in a film that shows her abilities to the max.
