The fighting is just too fake. Trying to look like a hero but he looks so bad. He gets beaten up too easily and totally fakes it. The fighting choreography looks so fake. It looks so staged. The guys just stand there and so expect to get hit. I mean, he's no Bruce Lee obviously, but look at Jet Li's choreography! This fighting is so easy to follow it looks so boring and fake. Jackie Chan's choreography looks so great too, his is funny. His acting is okay, but the fighting is just too boring. It puts me to sleep. Please man, no wonder this movie got its rating. This guy is not creative, he shouldn't do any more action films if the action puts you to sleep. Look at all his movies! A lot of them get low ratings! Come on guys, if you call THIS good then you haven't seen nothing yet.
