Well I am a fan of the Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Will Ferrel, etc. movies, but "The Breakup" was AWFUL.<br /><br />Let me say, it started off pretty funny, just like any Vince Vaughn movie. He did the monotoned funny monologue. The exposition of the movie is pretty amusing as you are introduced to everyone.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn works with his 2 brothers on a tour guide bus, and Jennifer Anniston works in an art gallery with a strange but funny boss and a gay, semi-drag-queen co worker, played by Justin Long from Dodgeball (in this movie he has long, straight, black hair and looks like a Chinese woman.) Towards the beginning, there is a scene where Anniston and Vaughn's families meet at dinner and you realize how Vaughn and Anniston's relationship is slowly declining...that is where it lost its spunk. ^ that scene is about 20 minutes- the rest is boring and not funny.<br /><br />As soon as they start fighting, the rest is them just whining and being mad at each other and thinking of ways to make each other jealous with Anniston going on dates and Vaughn having parties with his friends.From there, there is the occasional amusing line and the scene where you see Jennifer Anniston's butt.<br /><br />Even after breaking up, they still live together in their apartment because they need a place to live, and they have continuous disputes about whose room belongs to who (annoying). Jennifer Anniston starts to realize that she wants him back and invites him to a concert for a casual date. He does not show up, and she goes home and cries and whines. He explains to her that he wanted to go but blah blah blah. She tells him (while crying) that all she ever wanted from him was a little appreciation. This hits Vince Vaughn and he shows his appreciation.<br /><br />While she goes out one day, he cleans the house and makes dinner for her, and he does the "I love you, I'm never going to hurt you" cliché speech, and she has the non-cliché reaction- she tells him that she does not love him and they wind up selling their apartment. They both go their separate ways: he continues his tour guide business, and she travels for a while. They meet a few months after, and do the "it's good to see you! you look great! how you been?" conversation. You can definitely see that they are hiding their emotions behind their smiles and that they still want to be together. Then the best part of the movie happened. . . IT ENDED! I yelled "free at last!" after it ended.<br /><br />The movie is tedious, boring, and not amusing.
