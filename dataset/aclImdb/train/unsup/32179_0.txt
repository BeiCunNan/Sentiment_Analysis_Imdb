I always watch a Mexican movie with some of condescendent attitude, lowering my expectations so I cannot be too tough in my final judgment. I had no idea what the plot was and the very tag line plus today's Mexican show business hype promised something like an "evolved-but-limited" achievement.<br /><br />But this movie impressed me *a lot*. I, as a Mexican person, love intensively those movies in which characters are developed in such way I catch myself thinking something like "yeah, that folk is like my old pal Miguel", or "those places definitely remind me childhood", and not that kind of plots with funny acting clich√©s that are intended to muck American movies.<br /><br />Erotism has been a prime element in Mexican movies for so many years... but now we can thank G-d the days of cabaret, double-sense talk, erroneous poverty portrayals and sex with no obstacles are past.<br /><br />In this movie, sexual intercourse is not of a climatic taste, but the seed of inevitable events whose consequences are rather bizarre.<br /><br />I would spoil it if I said more. See it, enjoy it.
