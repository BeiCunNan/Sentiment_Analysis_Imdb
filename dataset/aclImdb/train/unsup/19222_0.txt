Humphrey Bogart plays a District Attorney who works closely with police detectives in the hopes of solving a series of violent murders. As the film progresses we learn that the murders were committed by a ring of assassins under the command of a devilish gang leader called Mendoza.<br /><br />Directed by Bretaigne Windust, the film is told largely through flashbacks. Unfortunately Windust's direction is flat and uninspired, the film only coming alive during 3 action sequences, two of which were ghost directed by Raoul Walsh.<br /><br />7/10 Â– Decades of television cop shows and police procedurals have diluted any impact "The Enforcer" might have once had. Bogart turns in a solid performance, but the rest of the film is simply lacklustre. The film's finale is handled well though, and a basement gangland meeting is suitably ominous.<br /><br />Note: The film is often classed as a "film noir". It is not.
