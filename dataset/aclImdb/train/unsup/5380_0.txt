Excellent! Some of the scenes/dialogue in this film are side-splitting! They are so ridiculous, pathetic and stupid - that it's comedy genius! - The 'Boss' trying to get the the gangs attention at a meeting ("Will ye shut-up and geez yer attention!"); one of the gang members is arguing with a young girl who's hanging up her washing ("Where's Australia?"); The Baker/Van Driver in the baker's shop picking up his order ("Cream Puffs?" - "Twelve." ...) etc. The film doesn't paint a very nice picture of Glasgow (dull, drab, raining), but the characters are full of colour. I 'think' the film wains a bit towards the end, but it's still brilliant viewing!!
