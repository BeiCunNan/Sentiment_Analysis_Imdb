Ricky (Eric Freeman) is the brother of the killer Santa from the first film. Don't worry if you missed it--the entire FIRST HALF of the film are scenes from the earlier movie! Then it gets back to Ricky being adopted and seemingly OK--but the events he witnessed as a child are still with him and--at the age of 18--he snaps and goes on a killing rampage. And, like his brother, he hunts down the Mother Superior who tormented him.<br /><br />Even as horror sequels go this is pretty terrible. For starters literally the whole first half are scenes from the earlier movie. Purportedly they are things Ricky remember--yet they're all things that happened to his brother which Ricky has no way of knowing! Things don't improve with the second half. The killings are pretty silly (one guy is impaled by an umbrella!) and the script is really pathetic. You gotta love the scene where Ricky kills off a guy and his girlfriend's reaction is a shrug of the shoulders and saying, "Thanks"! Yes he DID try to rape her beforehand but still... And when Ricky and his fianc√©e go to the movies they end up seeing the first movie which means we get to see it TWICE! It all leads up to an eye-rolling finale.<br /><br />The acting is lousy. Freeman is so terrible it's almost embarrassing to watch. His "acting" during the "big" rampage at the end is just beyond belief. I just sat there wondering what the hell the guy thought he was doing. I do like the "Garbage Day" bit though.<br /><br />Bottom of the barrel stuff here. Might be good for a few laughs from fans of the first movie but nobody else. A 1.
