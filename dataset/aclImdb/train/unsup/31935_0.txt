I adore this movie. I'm glad I was fortunate enough to get this video! Because you won't find many around anymore. There were two versions of this movie: The Tv 5 part episodes and the movie itself Secret of the Sword. I was however disappointed because the movie had many cut outs of interesting dialog that are in the tv 5 part episodes. But other than that I was astounded by SOTS. Action packed, filled with humor, and the finding of a long lost twin sister, made it some what emotional for me. The voice actors of He-Man and She-Ra (John Erwin and Melendy Britt)did an incredible job! And where ever they may be out there I wish I could tell them how immensely I enjoyed the He-Man and She-Ra series! How it impacted my life as a kid and as an adult! There is a huge community of the He and She fans out here and there is nothing more we want but to bring He-Man and She-Ra back to TV. Many fans, including myself have written enough fanfics to have a whole new season of episodes!! These series have surpassed your average kid's cartoon show! It was a shame that they were taken off the air, we are hoping and striving to get them on the Cartoon Network or Nickleodeon. If you don't believe me check out the episode "The Problem with Power." This episode is why we love He-Man so much. Be on the lookout for their videos will be re-released in 2000!!
