I haven't seen such a bad movie ever before, It is absolute non-sense. First a daughter, then a wife, then a companion, then a sister, what is the director thinking of the audience. Do not watch this movie, you can watch a cartoon instead with your kid rather than waste your time on this bad movie.<br /><br />Do not watch this movie, you can watch a cartoon instead with your kid rather than waste your time on this bad movie.<br /><br />Do not watch this movie, you can watch a cartoon instead with your kid rather than waste your time on this bad movie.<br /><br />Do not watch this movie, you can watch a cartoon instead with your kid rather than waste your time on this bad movie.
