From beginning to end, there is absolutely nothing to like about Raptor Island. The acting is terrible, as not one performance is worth highlighting. The special effects are pretty terrible, but the worst of the bunch is the bigger dinosaur at the end of the movie. The writing is terrible mainly because the subplot of the soldiers trying to capture the bad guy, but where the film really fails is when it takes an entire magazine to make the raptors stumble. These soldiers are the WORST shots ever put on screen, as bullets hit twigs and branches 50 feet in all directions and occasionally clip the dinosaurs themselves; when the bullets do hit the raptors, it takes nearly a hundred shots to put them down. The gore-factor for this film is, as usual for a Sci-Fi production, very high and adds nothing to the movie's atmosphere.<br /><br />All in all, I didn't have any expectations for this film, and only listen to this for background noise. I could only recommend it for that.
