Along a couple of days in Berlin of the 30s, the lives of some guests are connected in the fancy Grand Hotel. Grusinskaya (Greta Garbo) is a dancer in crisis who falls in love for Baron Felix Von Geigern (John Barrymore, the grandfather of the sweet Drew Barrymore). The Baron is a bankrupted noble, a very gentle and refined person, but indeed a thief of hotel rooms. Preysing (Wallace Beery) is a tough businessman, dealing in Berlin an important contract. Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford) is officially an stenographer and also an expensive 'working girl', making programs with her clients. Otto Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) is a sick man who had worked most of his life as an accountant in one of the Preysing's company. During these days, one of these characters is murdered by another one. In the end, Grand Hotel is a place where people come, go, and nothing ever happens, in accordance with the definition of one character. Yesterday I saw this movie for the first time. The first point that called my attention was the constellation of the stars sharing lead roles: none of the previously mentioned character has less importance in the story. The long shots, with lots of figurants in the lobby of Grand Hotel, are very impressive. The beauty of Greta Garbo, who has a very theatrical performance, and Joan Crawford are amazing, even for the present standards. Unfortunately the quality of the image and sound of the Brazilian VHS is horrible. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): 'Grand Hotel'
