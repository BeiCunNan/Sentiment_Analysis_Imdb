On the day of her wedding with Lex, Lana discovers the secret of Clark; Lex is blackmailed by Dr. Langston that threatens to reveal the truth about Lana's baby; and Clark finally confesses his love for Lana. When Lana decides to call-off her wedding to stay with Clark, Lionel forces her to marry Lex.<br /><br />"Promise" is the worst episode of "Smallville", actually a boring soap-opera. The cinematography is magnificent, but the annoying Lana Lang and her "love story" with Clark Kent is awfully unpleasant, and I do not know why the authors insist in this nasty romance. The moaning Lana deserves to be part of the Luthor's family. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "A Promessa" ("The Promise")
