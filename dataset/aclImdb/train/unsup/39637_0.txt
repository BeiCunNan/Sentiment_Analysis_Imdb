The few people below who recommended this tripe need to be dead. This travesty of a movie is the kind of thing that happens when talentless people fail to recognize their shortcomings and start trying to be the next Tarantino or Lynch. The lady who plays Geena is pretty attractive. An hour and a half of film and that is absolutely the only positive thing I can think to say.
