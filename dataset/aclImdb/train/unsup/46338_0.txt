A 'video nasty' only in the sense that it smells like something nasty you stepped in at the park, this film features a mad girl killing off some trespassers on her and her disabled father's land one by one. Featuring a hysterical leading performance by a sixth rate actress, below budget effects you could probably recreate at home with some ketchup and a running time of just over an hour which still feels like an eternity, it all adds up to a real waste of time you watch at your own risk. I have no idea why it qualified as a two-disc special edition, but at least I can put a couple of beverages down on my table when a friend pops over without the stains on my fine mahogany. ZING! 2/10
