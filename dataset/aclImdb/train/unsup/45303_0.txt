For those of you that heard about the Farah Fawcett nudity in this 'film' and are curious enough to check it out, don't! Not only is she just weird in this movie and not really attractive, Kirk Douglas shows his bare a$$, its nasty! They really need to have a warning for that, I'm still recovering.<br /><br />I love entertainingly bad movies, which is what this movie is, and at first glance, you may notice the all-star cast of Farah Fawcett, Harvey Kietel, and Kirk Douglas, but these are the only 3 people in the movie! Only 3 actors, and one main set. Kirk Douglas is just ugly, clearly he took this role to show he was still a leading man, yes, he may be in shape at 64 years old (which is how old he was when this was made) but its creepy! He looks like skeletor, and Farah Fawcett, literally 30 years younger than him, plays a doe eyed dumb blonde that is incapable of being anything but helpless. She act like a much younger woman in this movie, and I don't know how these actors could stay in character its so disgusting.<br /><br />The dog getting killed, Harvey Kietel's hand being chopped off are part of the fun gore that is in this movie, and the robot is clearly the most convincing actor of the movie, at about 45 minutes in you'll realize there just isn't too much to this movie - after Kietel's character is killed off, that just leaves the two creepy ugly idiots in love (fawcett and douglas) to run from the robot for the rest of the movie. Great stupid late night viewing.
