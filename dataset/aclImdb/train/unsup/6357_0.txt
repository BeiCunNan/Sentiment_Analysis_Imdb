Just dreadful movie. Something about Dr. Durea (J. Carrol Naish sadly) helping Dracula revive Frankenstein (for some reason) and searching for some new blood serum...or something.<br /><br />To be totally honest the plot makes little sense! I saw this on TV multiple times when I was little--loved it then. I just saw the new DVD put out a few years ago. My childhood memories have been destroyed! This is pretty horrid. The camera-work is dreadful and the blood and gore (which looked cool when I was little) is laughably fake now. Dracula played by the immortal Zandor Vorkov (actually Roger Engel) has a silly goatee, silly fake fangs and his voice is constantly echoing. Frankenstein (John Bloom) just looks like he has a severe case of the mumps. Naish actually gives a good performance--quite a feat considering his lines make no sense. Sadly this was his last role. Also the last role for Lon Chaney who plays a hulking, mute axe murderer. Also Regina Carrol (the directors wife) is mixed up in this and Anthony Eisley (who's not bad) playing a VERY old hippy.<br /><br />This is worth a peek for horror fans and it does have hysterically bad dialogue and a plot that will keep you guessing (what it's about). This was made over the course of a couple of years and the story kept changing--that's evident in the final product.<br /><br />On one hand I think this is worth seeing for camp value. On the other hand it's embarrassing to watch Naish and Chaney reduced to this. Proceed at your own risk.
