I had a hard time watching this movie. I need characters to care about, and a decent reason why I should. This has neither. <br /><br />Madeline Kahn is married to Bob Dishy and they are unhappy. Their son, David, is living at home again and he is unhappy. Barbara Barrie is a school teacher, and unhappy although she does not know it. Edie Falco is Judy Berlin, who's too clueless to know she's unhappy. <br /><br />This is all well and good..but WHY are they unhappy? Why hire actresses like Anne Meara and Julie Kavner and then use them in two scenes each? Why should I care about these people? They are not particularly interesting, and they can't even be articulate about why!<br /><br />There's some nonsense with an eclipse..an Alzheimer's victim walks in a classroom and stays there..a possible affair..and then its over, thankfully. 4/10.
