I saw this film at the Florida Film Festival in Orlando last month. It was probably the best one I saw there no doubt about it. I was truly blown away by the incredible acting, directing tactics and storyline. Mr. Byler takes us on a journey with these characters and it was one trip that I didn't want to end. There are so many films in the world today that are so cliche and not original! "Charlotte Sometimes" is unique, fresh and beautifully executed on all levels of filmmaking. If you a true film fanatic, run don't walk to see this brilliant work of art. Pass the word on because this is one film you don't want to miss out on.....
