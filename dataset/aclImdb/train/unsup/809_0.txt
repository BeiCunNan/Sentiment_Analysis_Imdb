Damaged Care is an excellent, must see movie which centers around the state of ethics in medical care and what happens when corporations get involved in medical decision making and make the bottom line take precedence over sound medical care. It delivers it's message both intelligently and poignantly, and without any over-dramatization; showing the dilemmas faced by the doctors, as well as, the plight of their patients. The script, acting, and direction were all realistic and superbly done. Laura Dern's performance as Dr. Linda Peeno is totally engrossing and believable. You'll stay riveted to the screen. Go see this movie, but be forewarned: even though most people are aware from the media or their own experience of what's going on today, watching this movie may make you become motivated enough to go out and help change things, if even in some small, personal way.
