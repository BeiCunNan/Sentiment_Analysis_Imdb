Sarah Jane Smith continues the battle to save the planet in her own way, by writing articles and teams up with children....Thats the initial plot and it just gets worser, the actress Elisabeth Sladen is perhaps one of the worst actresses I've seen, she overacts and underacts, cries...in like every scene and delivers lines with a cheesy smile.<br /><br />This is supposed to be a kids show so people will argue that it doesn't matter.<br /><br />YES IT DOES! These kids who watch the shows today will become filmmakers of the future and they deserve to be entertained by the finest...take shows like Young Dacula for example a British show that excels past any other kid show in the last decade of British shows. Just because its part of Doctor Who and has the awful Russel T Davies as the creator doesn't mean it has to be on the air for another pathetic series.
