This is about as bad as they get. Right now if I hadn't actually paid to see this in theater I would be laughing my head off about how bad it was. But the fact is a paid money for this garbage. I like good movies. And like the rest of us I dont like to lower my standerds once a a while for pop-corn movies that arent very good but still have some entertainment value. I atempted doing that with this movie, but instead of eating my pop-corn and making sarcastic comments about how bad the acting was I was puking my pop-corn in the aisles just thinking that I paid for this. This is another one of those movies I wanted to walk out on, but I paid for it so I cant bring myself to do it. It is just so bad, it would take to long to explain all of the things that went wrong on this movie, but I will try: EVERTHING. Avoid this movie at all costs.
