Most of the comments made on this movie are rather critical, and admittedly not all aspects of the film are equally satisfactory. However, it seems to me that you must judge it by what it seeks to achieve. It is not an ambitious movie in any sense and against that background I think it succeeds quite well. Both Iben Hjejle (her in particular) and Anders Berthelsen give very convincing performances and very much carry the film. This is the sort of film that makes you feel good without the shallowness and emptiness that so often mar the typical 'Feel-good' Hollywood production. For me, the pros weigh up the cons - and therefore I think it is well worth worth watching.
