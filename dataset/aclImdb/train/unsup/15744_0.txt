This is truly an amazing movie. It does not have a very suspenseful plot, it is not very gory, but there is something sinister and even humorous about the series of events that make this a truly bizarre movie. The acting is surprisingly quite good, the plot is quite good but most of all it is very entertaining and very hard to change the station once it starts. The perfect B movie to watch after coming home from a few beers on a Saturday night. The dominatrix wife of the villain's illusive enemy is so perfect in her role that it makes you almost forget the great performances of the the evil looking dwarf, the puppet master (or the guy who looks after the dolls), the tiny headed villain and of course the blood dolls. Ten stars, better than any commercial block buster movie ever released.
