If you know what are you gonna see it is half OK. The first thing that you are gonna think after you watch the film is: where is the warrior dress that Monique Gabrielle has in the cover box? And that is the only reason to pick that movie: Monique Gabrielle. Do not expect more.<br /><br />"Deathstalker 2: Duel..." is a very bad movie, with a ridiculous acting, trashy explosions, horrible music, lamentable directing, dreadful dialogues, etc. But they know that they are not doing a masterpiece and knowing that you will not take the film seriously, so although it is a bad movie, it can be watched.<br /><br />If you want to know how the serie Z movies are, that is your movie. Nothing else.
