From start to finish, this movie was a cartoon. It was like watching an episode of "Courage the Cowardly Dog" or the Halloween episodes of all the other Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon regulars. But it was live action, without toning down any of the gory moments for children, and that made it amazing! This is a sad day in all movie genres. Originality is dead. People hail horror movies like The Descent and The Mist, ignoring the fact 95% of the movies could have been copy/pasted from the last monster movie that held its run. The fact that this movie takes those clich√©s and actually laughs in their face, I can't help but enjoy it. People sit around and say, "Oh, it's not original, but what is anymore?" instead of taking a risk and making something that IS original.<br /><br />Feast isn't original, but it challenges movie makers to be original by making fun of them. Contrary to the countless "gory" movies like 30 Days of Night, the makers of Feast honestly have balls because they do what the others don't: be different.<br /><br />That's not saying this movie is gory; it really isn't. It's pretty genetic and family friendly. I'd be hard-pressed to say the gore in this movie is much more over-the-top than the new Indiana Jones movie. Simply put, the gore is more than most movies, but it's so generic it really isn't that gory.<br /><br />That's the only complaint I have. The rest is cartoony, art house fun.<br /><br />3/10
