We rarely stop a film before passing judgment, but we just couldn't take it. The film is probably very well created, but we don't see the humor in extremely dysfunctional people. Self-centered highly dysfunctional personalities don't touch my funny bone, just my sympathy or maybe there was just not enough wit to keep it entertaining in spite of the human suffering. When Woody Allen portrayed a poor twisted slob, he was over the top and peppered his dialog with witty jokes. The characters of this film had no witty lines and were much too real. It was almost like a documentary of how not to be a human being. This film probably appeals to a smaller audience, we're just not into it.
