"I Got Five On It" is a funny comedy with a simple plot. This film is full of nasty remarks, swear-words and silly jokes. In my opinion, all the movies about black people and weed are similar. The film is not too long but it's a bit boring for me. That repeating and suchlike opprobrious language feeds me up. However, the actors play their roles really well, they impersonate "cool guys who like weed" really realistic and funny. The vocabulary of this film is full of invective and forwardness, so I would not recommend this movie for people, who like films with meaningful thoughts.. Otherwise, this film is a good way to provide light relief and to laugh from silly jokes. Especially I liked the scene in the toilet.. I'm sure you'll like it very much! All in all, I recommend this film for everybody, who wants to relax after a hard day...
