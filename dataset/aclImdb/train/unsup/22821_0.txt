I really like this movie. I am surprised this movie has not received a better rating. It has many funny moments. I especially like the scenes with Cloris Leachman and Howie Mandell. The church scene had me crackin' up hard. I liked the foiled attempts that Christopher Lloyd would make on BoBo's (Howie Mandell) life. Colleen Camp was a good supporting character as his whiskey swiggin' wife. It is one of those movies that hardly anyone has heard about because if they did, you would have a fairly long conversation about it no matter good or bad.<br /><br />On that note: Every time I see this movie, it cracks me up. If you don't then just remember..."We all see things through different eyez right???" <br /><br />I'm out! Nuttin' more to say here!<br /><br />Here's my quote though: "I think Mr.Mandella smoked my drugs!" <br /><br />Here's my name too: ImRickJamesBitch
