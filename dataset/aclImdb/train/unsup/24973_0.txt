This is a very under-rated Mike Myers film. I have found myself watching this again and again, simply because it is so darn funny! There is really not a dull moment in it and to top it all off there is a scene with Mike (as his father) an elderly bag-piper, and a microphone which will leave you gasping for air as you laugh!
