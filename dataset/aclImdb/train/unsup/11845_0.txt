As always, I was mentally prepared for this movie and its moving and deep plot... So I took some Kleenex and pressed play.<br /><br />Photography in this movie is one of its strongest points besides acting, both of them are just magnificent; and directing obviously was the same way for getting the previous mentioned points that way.<br /><br />The story never gets boring, it's just fun, entertaining. And, as every movie should be, it creates many feelings inside of you through your way watching its images and listening to its beautiful music.<br /><br />Don't forget to watch every single second of the movie and the credits, with beautiful still photographs on it.<br /><br />One of the best Japanese dramas out there, don't miss it.
