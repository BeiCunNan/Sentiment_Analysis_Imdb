Kentuckian Lance Fuller heads west with a wagon train and his one-hundred rifles meant for the settlers of California. When his wagon breaks an axel, he's forced to stay behind with a small disparate group and look for a large enough piece of wood to fix it, all the while contending with in-fighting and the lingering threat of Comanches.<br /><br />This starts slow and only gets a little better as time goes on. Despite a few sparks along the way, this dull western never catches fire the way it should have. Chill Wills is good as Fuller's partner, but not good enough to inject much life into this very Luke-warm production. There is some good scenery though.<br /><br />Viewers seeking out a nineteen-fifties color B-western can do a lot worse, but they can definitely do a heckuva lot better too.
