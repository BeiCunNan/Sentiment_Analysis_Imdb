This show was so sad, however it really upset me because it was "ripped from the headlines" and at the time, the headline it was ripped from was my school. So even though I feel that it is an important topic, it could have been covered in a better way, or at least it should have had a Long message in the end. Because if anything it is merely suggesting to students a new way of accomplishing something. Also i feel as though the show cared more about the ratings and the number of viewers then they cared about the viewers that this would upset. At my school the kids playing this type of attack were arrested, but what about the other kids from the other schools that were not so lucky, how do you think they felt when the turned on the TV for their weekly does of One Tree Hill?
