The Haunted Mansion is a film for the hole family, which as we know is based on the Disneyland ride, fact that had me expecting nothing from it! but any way, it resulted to be pretty amazing, Eddie Murphy's performance is good and funny as well as the plot that ended up being really entertaining, go see it!!!
