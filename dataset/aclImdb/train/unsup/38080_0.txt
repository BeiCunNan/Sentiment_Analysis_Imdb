just finished watching this movie and i can NOT recommend it to anyone out there. first of all it has no story to follow: instead of having a slasher who kills all the nasty rich kids one by one (copykilling after urban legends as usual), it's some voodoo-magic-zombie thing! yeah i know, now you'll say: where's the story in that? but i'm not lying: that's ALL that's going to happen! second thing is i just can't believe what they did when they handled this flick in the post production: at some points, the scenes are completely out of order so again the story lacks! dude, i wish i had money to make such a movie, it'd be better than this direct-to-trash format. okay, in the end i see one thing: these guys had a huge bag of weed with them and i swear (!), they smoked it all up, esp. the foxy-woman, and turned this movie into a documentation about what happens/what you see when you get hold on some really good shoot (your comment contains prohibited words!) :) one * for the smoking foxing brown, be honest, you REALLY where hight, right? and another * for, uh, i don't care...i love you all, peace!
