This movie is something that sets a view on how war is really like...it's disturbing and unfair... but this movie shows thats their is always hope; that their is always someone who will stick up for those who are to afraid to stand up. Romero was a man that stood for all Salvadorian, even the poor. This brilliantly shows how Romero gave hope and to those who have lost their fate to those who thought they have lost everything. he shows his people that everyone needs to be strong and determined. I believe this is a great movie that shows people how the rest of the world is suffering. I loved this movie and i believe that many people would enjoy the movie. God bless Romero and Raul Julia..
