I remember sighing as my brother rented this movie, but it turned out to be quite good. And it has one of the funniest lines in a movie that I've ever seen (the shocked response of Troy in the pep assembly).<br /><br />The acting is excellent in spots, and very good overall. Of course George C. Scott and Kathy Bates deliver on their performances, especially Scott.<br /><br />While the ending may have been a little cliched, it still is a enjoyable movie, and much better than your usual teen flick..I'll never understand why people enjoy "Clueless" when there are movies like Angus that offer far more accurate portrayals of high school life.<br /><br />This one gets a solid 3 1/2 out of 5 in my book
