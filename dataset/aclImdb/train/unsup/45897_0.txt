First we have a young man who has recently come to a village and is an officer there but is dissatisfied and wants to go to America.<br /><br />No dissolution of his story or whether or not he reaches his goal is ever revealed in the film.<br /><br />It took him thirty minutes just to leave the village after he decided to go.<br /><br />Next we're on the road with this young man and soon we meet up with other travelers who are afoot. Unfortunately, none of them are particularly interesting.<br /><br />A monk, who is one of the travelers, tells a story. Basically it is very similar to the old story of a young man gets lost in the mountains and comes to the farmer's house and asks if he can stay the night. The farmer, of course, has a beautiful young daughter. In this story the old farmer has a beautiful, young wife.<br /><br />The expected result comes about but we never are given a conclusion to the story as to what happens to the young wife and her older husband, or even what the point of the story is.<br /><br />The only possible reasons to watch this film is if one is a lover of all foreign films, has a particular interest in this country, or an incredibly bad case of insomnia.<br /><br />2 stars
