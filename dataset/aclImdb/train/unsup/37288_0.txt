The theme for this movie is quite similar to much from the same genre of danish films. But this one is probably the worst one of the lot! Movies like 'Gamle m√¶nd i nye biler' (Old Men in New Cars), 'I Kina spiser de hunde' (In China They Eat Dogs) and 'Blinkende lygter' (Flickering Lights) are light years ahead in every aspect. This movie is a sad production which could have been made much better. One can't help wondering about that soundtrack from the HORRIBLE Swedish singer Lisa Nilsson - was her record label the only (or should we call it rightfully lonely) sponsor of this flick?!? No wonder people turn to piracy and download instead of purchase DVDs. Movies like these makes you never want to spend another cent on the corrupt Scandinavian movie industry! Get real!!<br /><br />An ultra-generous 3/10 because of Bodnias acting.
