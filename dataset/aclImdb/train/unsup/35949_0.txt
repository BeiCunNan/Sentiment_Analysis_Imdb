An aging Rita Hayworth appears in a role beneath her talents.<br /><br />A beautiful Kim Novak (who has little acting skill) looks frighteningly out of place dancing and singing -- not to mention acting.<br /><br />Barbara Nichols (who had great acting skill) was woefully underutilized.<br /><br />Sinatra never was handsome enough to play such a character as Joey Evans. And yes, I am one of the people who is NOT charmed by his singing.<br /><br />A disaster yesterday and hopelessly dated today, Pal Joey is what many people eat on the cob.
