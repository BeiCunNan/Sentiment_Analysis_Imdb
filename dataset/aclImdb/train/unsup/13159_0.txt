This is arguably the best TV program I may have ever seen (and like many Americans born in the 70s and raised in the 80s and 90s I've seen more TV, I swear to God, than virtually anyone alive...I kid you not). Ironic too that Peter Krause should be a part of it, given that he was the featured character in what is also widely considered to be the greatest drama to ever air (Six Feet Under on HBO). Do yourself a favor and immerse your mind in this 3-part miniseries (each part 2hrs long) and you'll never, ever regret it. The best 6hrs of television you can spend, short of those amazing new fetal camera shows from National Geographic (the dog, the dolphin and the elephant, also great shows that aired last week alongside The Lost Room from Sci-Fi). This competes with "V" from the mid-80s for most captivating miniseries ever.
