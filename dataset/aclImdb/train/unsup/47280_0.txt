The first half of this movie is like a big black hole. It left no impression on me at all. It's neither bad nor good, but exists eternally in a sort of quality limbo.<br /><br />Fortunately, the second half picks up, and it gets bad enough to provide a few laughs.<br /><br />Another problem is that the effect of the film's first big surprise is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the copy on the DVD box gives it away completely. On the other hand, it was a pretty lame attempt at a surprise anyway. <br /><br />One can see why this one sat in the can for over a year (copyright 2000, released 2002) before finally being dumped to video.
