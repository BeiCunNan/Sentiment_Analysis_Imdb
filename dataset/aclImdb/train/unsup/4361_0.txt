No offense to Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, but this movie should not have been remade. It's not fair to Martin-Hawn that Lemmon-Dennis hit their version out of the park. Any remake would suffer.<br /><br />Jack Lemmon as George Kellerman is a lesson to us on how not to act in any place out of your natural environment.<br /><br />He is fantastic with his taking down names, numbers, badges, offices, titles, and whatever else he can remember (expecting a cabdriver to mail you change?). And in typical New York fashion, everybody reacts with a "Yeah? So what?" attitude.<br /><br />Rule #1 when you're an out-of-towner visiting a "big" city: Don't draw any more attention to yourself than you already have. This goes double if you're not in your own country.<br /><br />You just want to go up to him and say "forget a life in this city, you can't even handle a night in this city!" Rule #2 is more basic than Rule #1 (this goes even for when you're at home). Just behave yourself.
