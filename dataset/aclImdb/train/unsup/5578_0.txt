Yes. I have been able to watch this. I won't tell you how, but I have. Its a deep subject really - collecting dammed souls (Which I thought I might be watching another version of Ghost Rider, or something.) However, this show was light and humorous.<br /><br />It is a show that reminds me of one that used to be made here in England, way back in the 1960's - "Randle and Hopkirk Deceased". Anyone remember that show?????<br /><br />This show has great humour between its characters, and the plot/s of the shows are unique and light in a dark way.<br /><br />I like the way that they show is based within a Diy type store (The Workbench), giving it that "Down to Earth" feel about it...I love the way that the boss is always on to the 3 x slackers. Also making it realistic as well.<br /><br />I also love the fact that all his friends want to help him (Sock and Ben), and do so.- when ever the boss (*The devil contacts - SAM)<br /><br />He (SAM) has a love interest as well, who is incredible beautiful.(Andy). He likes her, she likes him, and yest not one of them have gone any further about it; and I also love the love/hate relationship between Sock and his old girlfriend - Josie. I would love these two feature in every episode, and maybe one day get back together. There are great in any episode they are in...<br /><br />I love the actor who plays the DEVIL (Ray Wise). Good quips, good lines, nice tan...He is smooth, and Ray Wise plays his part well.<br /><br />I still think the show mustn't get rid of the parents of these slackers. THey must be shown from time to time. To give the show reality as well. Remember, one of the quips is that they are all (*Or most of them - still at Home)<br /><br />Maybe a future episode can be written whereby all 3 of them leave Home and get a flat between themselves (Sam, Ben and Sock) eventually.<br /><br />And maybe a visit from the Other side (God) within this show would make it more interesting as well. Just to show that the devil doesn't and will not get it his own way all the time.<br /><br />I really do think that we have another hit show in the making here. It got that feel Quantuam Leap feel about it. You know what I mean?<br /><br />I hope the writers of Reaper read these comments.....
