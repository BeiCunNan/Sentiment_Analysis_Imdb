This is an obviously inspired film that isn't the usual predictable drivel that I see in so many films of this genre. It has a Taratinoesque quality to it but isn't quite so scattered brained as most of his movies are. The characters are interesting and personable and not over the top, and there are some genuinely funny moments. There is a little bit of bad acting but not from the main actors at all, just in some of the bit parts. The story line is very good and although there are some violent moments in the movie it wasn't at all gory or messy. Also, the camera work is really quite unique and there is a flow to it that almost makes you feel like you are part of the movie. I would think that a lot of other filmmakers will be trying to use this type of effect in upcoming movies. Overall I would give this move at least an 8 out of 10.
