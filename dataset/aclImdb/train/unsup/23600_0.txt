This a superbly acted film about an undercover cop( Sean Pen) who infultrates a group of American/Irish gangsters who he used to be friends with. The storyline is not the best but it does not have to be when you are watching people like Gary Oldman act his socks off. The film is shot superbly too , especially the fantastic gun fight at the very end in the Irish bar. If there was one critisism i have to make of this film it would be that it is a little too long which can make it feel a little slow. Overall , if you like gangster movies you will like this. 8 out of 10.
