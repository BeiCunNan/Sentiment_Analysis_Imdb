I read the book a week before I watched this 'made for TV' movie. The previews should have warned me what to expect but I still watched it. I was hoping it would be enjoyable but the insipid performance from the actor playing 'Holmes' was barely offset by the far more scintillating 'Watson'. If you've not seen it, don't waste your time. Instead enjoy either the Jeremy Brett or Basil Rathbone versions.
