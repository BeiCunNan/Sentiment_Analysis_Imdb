It caused me physical pain to watch this movie. Not only was some of the acting terrible, and the effects were cheap, but Drake was ugly (C'mon, he's essentially Draco and the Scarred one's kid, and we all know how lovely Draco was). The plot was sub par, and the dragons were terrible. The FULL GROWN dragon was about 1/4 the size of Draco.<br /><br />This movie MAY have had the possibility to NOT SUCK if it had a bigger budget and a better script. I wouldn't let my kids watch this. I'd watch the first one with them. Honestly this shouldn't have happened. Don't even get me started on how many shots they took from Dragonheart, and they bastardized the old code. The Dragons looked very very fake, and the fact that the first movie was made in '96 and had much much better effects shows the lack of care put into the sequel. I gave this movie a chance, against my better judgment, thinking "It can't be THAT bad." But it was. The Bad guy was too clich√©, and not the kind of bad guy that David Thewlis was in DH. It was a travesty, and nothing can be done to save it. Children should not be allowed to watch it. <br /><br />Oh, and taking the music that Randy Edelman wrote and using it throughout it not going to save it. Yeah. I'm sorry but I could not STAND this movie.
