I remember going to see this movie on it's release in the Odeon Leicester Square. There couldn't have been more than about 20 people there but it didn't matter because I got so wrapped in this film.<br /><br />It is so good because it is such a fantastic story of the courage of these pilots, the support from their wives and the desperate race to beat the Russians into space. A script which never drags, is full of humour and pulls great performances from some of the young actors of the day - Sheperd, Glenn, Quaid, Hershey, Ward, Harris....the list goes on.<br /><br />Add to this the superb cinematography and sound...what sound! I have just ventured in to the world of DVD and now have Chuck Yaeger breaking the sound barrier in my living room. My neighbours may never speak to me again..........
