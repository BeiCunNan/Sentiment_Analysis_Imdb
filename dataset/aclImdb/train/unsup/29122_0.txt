Hav Plenty is one of the most under-rated, under-exposed movies I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. It was entertaining from beginning to end. The laughs were 'Plenty'-ful. (Lots of critics use puns, why should I be different.) If you just want to have a good time watching a movie, invite over a few friends and pop 'Hav Plenty' in the VCR. P.S. They should have hired me to promote this movie maybe more than 12 people would have seen it.
