This movie is a rather quaint combination of a very thin plot idea stretched way too far and the seldomly successful occurrence of the writer, the producer, the director and one of the main characters being the same person, in this case Gregory Christian. Now sometimes people get away with doing that, but through watching "Cowboy Junction" I think it is obvious that Gregory Christian would have more than just a hard time getting the opportunity to do any of those four jobs in anything but a very low budgeted indie for the simple reason that he does not show mentionable talent in any of the four fields of work! To be fair Gregory Christian was not the only bad thing that happened to this movie (all though he happened a lot) the other two principal actors are not much better although James Michael Bobby compensates greatly for lack of acting skills by his very good looks and sexy/charming smile! The plot in it self is so thin that it didn't take too long to figure out the "big secret" that "turns out" to be pivotal to the plot towards the end! Another disappointment to me was that the sex scenes weren't even that good for a movie that tries to play the sexual notes. I would actually go as far as to say that the best thing about this movie was the music, and the music wasn't even that good!!!
