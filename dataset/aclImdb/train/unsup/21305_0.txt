This movie is so boring that I turned it of after watching it for 45 minutes. It tells the story of: Friends of the president who are murdered aboard their yacht in the Caribbean and Jack Ryan has to solve the murder and that leads to a dangerous confrontation with the Colombian drug cartel. This could be a really great movie and exciting movie, but it turns out in a boring movie, I had to read the IMDb.com plot summary to really understand the story. The movie couldn't get my attention so I turned it of after 45 minutes and that's sad because it has some fine actors in it Like: Ford, Dafoe, Anne Archer, Thora Birch and Hope Lange. It has a great story but the whole movie is very boring.
