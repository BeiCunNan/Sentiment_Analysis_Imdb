Shaadi No.1 is a milestone film- actually a U-turn film with which Mr. David Dhawan has relaunched himself into the genre of over-the-top comedy with minimum sense and maximum words.Needless to say the film is not worth seeing even once and reasons are many- 1.If you have seen Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya or even of them you could be having great expectations with this one and you would not feel anything sort of irritating disappointment.<br /><br />2.If you thought that you could at least see six hotties (Ayesha, Esha, Soha, Arti, Sophie & Riya) then you won't get to see much of them.And when you'll get back home you won't even remember if there was one Miss Riya Sen (or some other actress) in the film.<br /><br />3.If you saw Munnabhai MBBS and you think Sanju baba can tickle your funny bone like no one else then what you get from our original Bhai in this film is a score of not-so-funny shayaris which he proudly called Misals.<br /><br />4.And if you didn't take all these things seriously and you decided to see it once for yourself then I will pray for you and I'll hope that a massive powercut occurs in your area and you are not able to watch the climax.<br /><br />It's not necessary but let me mention that film is around three husbands played by Fardeen, Zayed and Sharman who (exactly like Masti) are not happy with their marital (read sexual) life.Then they go for 'Bahar ki Biryani' apart from 'Ghar ki Daal'- only to find themselves into the clutches of Mr. Lakhwinder Singh (Sanjay Dutt).Well there's little more I can tell about the story but it's pretty much like Masti.<br /><br />Now I'd like to request (on the behalf of everyone who's starved of a good comedy film) that please move ahead of Three-Starved-Guys-Extra-marital-Affair kind of comedy.It is not the only way to make people laugh.
