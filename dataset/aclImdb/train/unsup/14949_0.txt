It was the most annoying and stupidest film that I saw in 1997. I remember reading somewhere where Harrison Ford had stated about his dislike for the film, Blade Runner(1982). Well, Air Force One(1997) is a lousy feature compared to that scifi classic. Gary Oldman is average as the main villain. One reason I hate this movie is its Hollywood by the numbers approach and lack of any compelling characters.<br /><br />It seems that Harrison Ford is trying to be John Wayne in his actions and this is the film's fatal mistake. The role of the President was originally written for Kevin Costner who instead choose to do The Postman(1997). I depised Air Force One(1997) so much that I was rooting for the villains to succeed. Air Force One is a disgrace from a compatent director like Wolfgang Petersen who did better things like Das Boot(1981), The Neverending Story(1984), and In the Line of Fire(1993). Glenn Close is the only actor who gives an interesting performance in the movie.
