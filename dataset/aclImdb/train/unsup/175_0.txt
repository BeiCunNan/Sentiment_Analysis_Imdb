If anyone wants to see what film acting is all about, watch Claudette Colbert's performance in this movie. She imprints life and humanity onto the movie screen in a timeless performance.<br /><br />Orson Welles is somehow able to tone down his larger-than-life persona and give a good performance, although the makeup job he wears is not very good. George Brent proves that there is a place for his much-maligned type of acting which is fine for this type of role. Natalie Wood delivers a great child-actor performance. The orchestrated musical score is lush, dignified, old-fashioned, and appropriate.<br /><br />Forget any reservations you may have about black-and-white, age of the film, or any other concerns. The sincerity of everyone involved is impressive, and rare in movies of any era.
