I have seen many movies on the Third World war and the apocalyptic future that waits for us. And as interested party in the topic, I decided to see this movie. Fat mistake. Friends, do not see a movie for reading simply the synopsis.<br /><br />Originally, the treatment of the astronauts (that they look like truckers) directing a space station with nuclear weapons in orbit it is an interesting idea. Even when the war begins it is original enough that put it from the point of view of the three enclosed in the station.<br /><br />But later, when they come to the devastated Earth, everything changes. There is no society in reconstruction, not even the radioactivity looks like a problem for the survivors. Not. What matters is that a teenager has an army of teenagers who has dominated the population of a village. And they are wicked and blablabla and some Mad Max' aesthetic and more blabla. Mediocre action, absurd script. Bad lighting. Horrible.
