David Janssen didn't seem to have had the best of luck in movies. He appeared in approximately 32 movies while at Universal International and post that he appeared in several to a few movies of varying quality. While several were passable (Marooned, Warning Shot) were passable--watchable if not great--several were plain embarrassments (like "My Six Loves" and "Once is Not Enough").<br /><br />This movie seems to be among those that Janssen shot for television, where he seemed to have had better luck. If it was on TV, I question why the people that put this out on DVD presented a fouled-up copy with beeping out several words throughout. And it looks as if it had the life--whatever life it had--sucked right out of it. I object to these censored efforts. It is one thing to place cut up versions on television due to legalities. It is another thing entirely to put them to video that I rent or purchase. The people behind this thing really do not have much of an excuse.<br /><br />The picture looks grainy, the score is badly dubbed and edited and the script and the performances look dismal. The atrocious score robs several scenes of whatever tension and excitement they have going for them. And Janssen looks as if he is merely walking through the whole thing, wondering what in the hell he is doing as a former government agent enlisted by Ray Milland to investigate several cases of blackmail or so you think. John Saxon adds what little life there is to this as a rival to Janssen but when he left, the picture became a boring slog.<br /><br />It is too bad that the better movies David Janssen made are not! available, like the much better "Birds of Prey" or "Nowhere to Run". Now those are much better than this one.<br /><br />I give this a 1, and the DVD a 0. Again, these may be low-budget but you can do much better, guys.
