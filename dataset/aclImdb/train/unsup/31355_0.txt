Being a big Dark Angel fan (at least a Season One Dark Angel fan), my main reason for watching NCIS originally was Michael Weatherly. Seeing how he could play someone so different from Logan Cale was fascinating for me. That fact that Mark Harmon (whom I've always enjoyed watching)and David McCallum (fan of the Shaphire and Steel program)were also in the program was a bonus. My sister in law is a Mark Harmon fan, so she got something out of the program and everybody (my father included) loves Abby. This is a program that everyone in the family can get something out of. The occasional Dark Angel reference thrown in adds to my fun. (i.e William Gregory Lee who played Zack in Dark Angel was a guest star and was the actor who played Logan's Uncle Jonas)
