Ghosthouse - La Casa 3 (aka House: La Maldici√≥n Final) was released in the eighties when the House franchise was a pretty big business, not so big as the Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street franchises but something important. Fortunately Umberto Lenzi only tries to exploit this franchise only superficially and he creates an intimate ghost story. A young couple tries to find the answers for a strange radio phenomena and that leads them to the famous haunted house of the title, from that point they and some other guys find themselves threatened by a strange and powerful ghost.<br /><br />This movie has some cool gory moment right from the beginning. But we couldn't expect less from Umberto Lenzi. But Ghost house isn't such an extreme piece of carnage as Cannibal Ferox or other works of this extraordinary filmmaker. Ghosthouse has more suspense than massacre. Even having nothing but low-budget Lenzi delivers a good worthwhile horror flick using his imagination to give a handful of creative killings and a good use of the cameras makes the rest. <br /><br />The music is a completely different stuff, we could define it as the typical bugging synthesizer music, this is not a low point, on contrary this is the music that helps to create the uncomfortable ambient that surrounds the movie. Recommended for fans of Lenzi (yes he have some fans!), if you appreciate B-Movies and don't criticize every second of them you will find that Ghoshouse is stunning.
