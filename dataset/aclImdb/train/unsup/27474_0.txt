This was one of the best series ever, everyone remembers hardball. it's a shame it only ran for one series.<br /><br />The chemistry between John Ashton & Richard Tyson was amazing, it has to be one of the most underrated TV shows that people enjoyed that never got a second series or even more.<br /><br />The comedy between these two was brilliant. it's a shame they can't remake the series as it would not be the same without John Ashton & Richard Tyson, to me they made hardball and it would be impossible to replace them.<br /><br />Columbia Pictures Television would make a fortune if they released this as a box set. i'm almost certain it would be a hit.
