What should have been the gimmick for a 30 second restaurant commercial (in which the cooks are conjoined twins) is instead two hours of pure hell. I have often felt that if I a critic says a movie is good, people believe it , no matter how bad it actually is, and this is one of those cases.<br /><br />The direction? Well there was none. I think the only six shots in the entire movie were shot-counter shots, even when both characters were the conjoined twins. I looked away to see if when I looked back, I could imagine what the screen would look like in my mind, purely based upon the sound. I was right, the camera in the same place.<br /><br />Acting? Matt Damon played the part of someone who knew he could act but wanted a beach house so did a stupid movie well. Greg Kinnear, is blond.<br /><br />Cinematography. I think I saw some shadows somewhere but maybe not. That is perhaps good for a comedy where you want things to be bright, but I wouldn't have known any better if they let a monkey do the lighting. Even a stupid monkey.<br /><br />Writing? The only good joke, which I won't ruin, is in the trailer anyway. And its not that funny. Otherwise, I didn't laugh during the whole thing. I was expecting a bad gross-out comedy and I just got a bad movie.<br /><br />Even if you like this movie, you have to admit that there are plenty of talented writers and directors out there that could make a better movie, but I guess the American audience is too dumb to know talent when they see it and instead liked this movie.
