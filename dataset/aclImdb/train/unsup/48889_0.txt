I remember reading the Roger Ebert review for the first Power Rangers movie and above all else he hated the fact that the Rangers were, essentially, color coded clones with only thin streotypes as personalities. Well, I'm dying to know what he thought of this entry. It emphasises Ebert's point in the scene where a little kid who was allowed to stand in for an injured Ranger gets the magic armor on... and in the dissolve, we see him replaced with an adult sized armored stuntperson.<br /><br />I'm what kids consider a cool adult. I don't hate boy bands, I can name all the Pokemon, and I enjoyed the first season of "Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers" as I'd enjoy an old Godzilla flick. This movie was when I started to get a tad disillusioned with them.
