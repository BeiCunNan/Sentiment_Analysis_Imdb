I was truly moved by this movie even though there are many parts that are simply unbelievable. One rarely is hitchhiking and gets picked up by a van full of really famous regional and perhaps international musicians. One cannot smuggle someone across the border under the rear seat of a van. Not going to happen. Not now. Not if you are driving and do not look 100% gringo. The INS would never allow someone to simply drive away from a raid in a truck with compadres scrambling in the back to get away. Even though there are these "errors" one must realize that this a work of fiction and these sort of incongruencies do not detract from the overall power of the film.<br /><br />Here in California there are thousands of women from Mexico and Central America trying to make some money to get ahead in the world. They are often away from their children. Opportunities are rare where they are from. This reality is true and that is where the movie's force comes from - the reality of these illegal immigrants.<br /><br />The acting is excellent and the pace of the story is perfect. The transformation of Enrique played by Eugenio Derbez is marvelous. The young Adrian Alonso as Carlitos is great. I would highly recommend this movie. Compared to all the pure rubbish out there I was surprised this movie did not get a ton of promotion.
