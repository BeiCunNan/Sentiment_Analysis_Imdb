Genre: Drama / Comedy / Romance. This is what IMDB says. It's a drama to see that it isn't a comedy and you'll probably get romantic with the audience, since watching the screen will ruin one and a half hour of your life.<br /><br />As Dutchman I mostly feel embarrased with the typical Dutch movies of the last decades. Swearing, sex and agression, preferably a book converted to a movie. Here it's the same.<br /><br />For those of you who know BNN, the Dutch broadcasting organisation that has a trademark for rudeness, dumb&dumberness and programmes full of sex and swearing: yes, this movie has its trademark all over it.<br /><br />The actress Kim is overacting as a bitch and the story is so dumb that I really can't believe the hype when it was released.
