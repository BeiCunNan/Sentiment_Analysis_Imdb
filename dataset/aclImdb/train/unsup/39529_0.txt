This is a poor remake of Irwin Allens poor disaster movie Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea. All the same ingredients but done in a totally soulless way. The acting is so wooden it would not look out of place on Gerry Andersons Thunderbirds. I thought that they stopped making rubbish like this back in the 70's. Obviously not! IMDb says I must post at least 10 lines of text in this comment, but its difficult to type anything that is just not negative about this movie.<br /><br />Basically I just cant be bothered its not worth it! so! Rubbish! Rubbish! Rubbish!<br /><br />Waste of time!
