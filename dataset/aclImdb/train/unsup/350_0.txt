Like "Six Feet Under" and "The Sopranos" before it, Deadwood is emblematic of the fact that long form, done "right," provides a far broader palette for art than dinky old "cinema" ever could. (Sorry, cinema, you were my first love, but... that was before I knew!) The depths of character, the unremitting beauty and profundity of the dialogue... This show is Shakespeare/Dickens on TV, week after week. People will CLEARly still be watching Deadwood in a hundred years -- probably still in a THOUSAND, if the species lasts that long. They will be teaching it in high school. This show never ceases to explore and challenge its vast interpersonal landscape. It shines constant and ever brightening light into the murky depths of the human soul. Watching it, the jaw drops and only continues to plummet as the seasons roll all too quickly by.
