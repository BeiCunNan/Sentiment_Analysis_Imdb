I just really love this movie. Someone once said, "After the first part, you're addicted. After the second, you feel like you know the characters as if they were your own friends. In the end it's like finishing the reading of your favorite book", and it's true. When I was watching the last part of it, I laughed when they laughed, I had tears in my eyes when they were crying. And for me, that means a lot. I know six hours is quite long, but this movie was worth every second of it. <br /><br />At first, I didn't really think La Meglio Giovent√π would be an interesting movie, but having nothing better to do, I watched it. After like, half an hour, I didn't want to stop watching any more, because the movie started turning out to be quite nice. I'd love to see it again. It is realistic, it looks like it could really have happened, and the characters somehow feel very familiar to me, like I really know them. And well, I wonder why nobody I know has seen it. They really should.
