I have a feeling that most people are going to either really like or really dislike IZO. It is another of Miike's "stranger" offerings as it isn't a cut-and-dry narrative film. It leaves a lot open and allows the audience to create their own impression to exactly what or who Izo is. Some viewers will find this annoying - others may find it refreshing. I personally like a little more narrative in my films - but IZO is a very intriguing and beautifully shot film. I'll spare any of my own interpretation as to what the film is about - and keep it to the most basic of "facts"...<br /><br />Izo is a vengeful spirit who skips from place-to-place and era-to-era killing pretty much everyone in his path. That's about it. There are several other side-plots and other goings-on...but that's about all you'll need to know going into the film.<br /><br />Some very cool and stylish swordplay battles - reminiscent of a newer style of more traditional Japanese samurai films. Every battle that Izo encounters in his "travels" is interesting and stylish in its own way - and there's very little "down-time", as the action comes fast and frantic. The storyline and motivation of the film may be a little to vague to appeal to some viewers - but like other strange Miike entries such as GOZU and VISITOR Q - IZO is more of an "experience" than a "story". Worth a look for those that don't mind a more open-ended storyline...8/10
