I had seen the poster for this film, but I didn't really think about critics opinions or anything before I watched it, maybe I should of. Basically some American teenagers arrive in the Ireland, and are promised by Irish friend Jake (Jack Huston), and expert in mushrooms, the "trip" of a lifetime, knowing their eagerness for adventure. Jake warns about the certain "shrooms" they can't eat, but hardly any of them listen, and horrific visions start happening. Because they are high on these magic mushrooms, they don't know if the ghostly creatures and other things are for real, or part of their hallucinations, to be honest, neither do we (the audience). There are also some really creepy woodsmen, Ernie (Don Wycherley) and Bernie (Sean McGinley) don't help the panicking teens. As everyone is being bumped off, it becomes clear that it doesn't matter if these visions are real or not, the evidence is there afterwards, the ending however, with last survivor, Tara (Lindsey Haun), isn't great. Also starring Max Kasch as Troy, Maya Hazen as Lisa, Alice Greczyn as Holly and Robert Hoffman as Bluto. The plot is certainly innovative, and the gore amount gives the story a bit of energy, but just like the characters, you don't know what's real and what's not, and it is a little tedious. Okay!
