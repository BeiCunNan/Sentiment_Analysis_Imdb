I really loved the first movie Mimic. The second movie, Mimic 2: Hardshell was ok too. It had some very suspenseful moments, and it felt true to the original film.<br /><br />This third film, written and directed by a young filmmaker, J.T. Petty, who as the documentary on the dvd indicated was just given the premise of "Rear Window with Roaches" and was told to run with it. He did, but he ran as far away from the original concept as he could. This movie plodded along at a snail's pace with uninteresting characters and no real story sense and basically had no suspense at all until the last ten minutes. And it was painful to wade through the movie to get to that part, but I just had to see how this turkey was going to end. I can understand the filmmaker and studio wanting to try something new and different, but this whole story premise was too off the wall and didn't give the viewer what he expected after having already seen the previous two films. This movie was shot in Romania (I can't understand why-----didn't we have any locations available in America?)and didn't have a very good look to it at all.<br /><br />I can only hope that if there is a fourth movie, it will be made by more experienced and competent filmmakers and will give the viewers what they expect in a franchise horror film. I believe this movie was a straight-to-video release because the studio had no faith in this movie to<br /><br />stand up at the box office. And they were right.
