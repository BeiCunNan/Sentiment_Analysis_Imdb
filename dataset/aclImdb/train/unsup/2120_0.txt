I expected the Prince of Egypt to be another 'run of the mill' cartoon which makes you say 'Wow, great animation!' but one which you basically forget about the next day. I was wrong.<br /><br />As a Christian, I fully expected the film to take the story of Moses and jazz it up out of all proportion, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the story remained one of pretty much Biblical accuracy. Obviously some artistic license has to be taken to make the film more appealing to children and the non-Christian.<br /><br />Almost to take a swipe at Disney, the Prince of Egypt oozes fluid animation and the water effects especially are the best I've seen in a cartoon. If any producers are going to pull Disney from its perch, Dreamworks will definitely be the ones to do it. Rarely have I seen animation of this quality before.<br /><br />But the classy look of this film only hides its true nature as a Biblical story. The film delivers the story of Exodus admirably, with just enough humour and artistic license to keep the children interested. On a deeper, more spiritual level the film excels though. The story of Moses is not an easy one to come to grips with in the Bible and to see it brought to life on the big screen was a joy to behold. The burning bush scene was one of the most powerful, moving pieces of cinema I have experienced and the red sea scene was almost as powerful in it's own right. Obviously from a Christian viewpoint, this film couldn't have been made any better. To somebody else however, the Prince of Egypt also has so much to offer: Great animation, a cracking story and a good dose of humour. I highly recommend this film to anybody and everybody.
