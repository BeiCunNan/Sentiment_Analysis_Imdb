In the long history of cinema, not many sequels have been of the highest quality. And while "Ginger Snaps II" is not better than the original, I'm proud to have it as a sequel to one of my favorite horror movies of all time. And as a Canadian, I'm very proud that our filmmakers are capable of making a horror franchise that maintains not only the scare-factor, but also a lot of much-needed dignity.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Brigitte is on the run from the events of the first movie. The monkshood drug that saved Jason in the first movie is apparently not permanently effective, and she has to take it repeatedly to stop the transformation. A werewolf is searching for her (presumably Jason from the first movie transformed from not taking more monskhood), and wants to mate with her. When Brigitte is found unconscious on the street carrying syringes and monskhood, she's taken to a rehab clinic for drug-abusers.<br /><br />This movie is very different from the first one. Brigitte's transformation is very different from Ginger's. She keeps having visions of Ginger, who tries to tell her that the inevitable is, in fact, inevitable. The strong characters remain in this entry. Ghost could not be creepier, and Tyler could not be more of a jerk. But what impressed me about this movie was that it still managed to be scary. Very close, in fact, to the first movie. The suspense is strong, and the use of dead silence is perfectly executed. And, like the first movie, I was happy not to see a drop of CGI throughout the whole thing.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />I was lucky enough to win free passes to see this movie two days earlier than everyone else, and boy am I glad. I can't say I have any real problem with this movie. It's quite excellent. The first movie is better because...it's the first one. That's all I can say.<br /><br />8/10
