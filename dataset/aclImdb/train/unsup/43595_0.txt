Okay, most of the film is pretty boring: people sitting around in a cabin, listening to an alian invasion, nothing much happening in terms of group dynamics. Special effects are beyond belief. That's something that would not have happened to Ed Wood, he would have made an awful film on the same budget but with much better special effects. However, the film does have its redeeming features. The idea of having radio/TV stations still running while earth is being taken over clearly influenced Romero in Dawn of the Dead. Some dialogue is reasonably funny and some shots are pretty atmospheric. like the deserted airport in the beginning. The final scene is really funny, the last survivors turn into Adam and Eve in a completely over the top scene, and it's not the hunk but the nerd who gets the girls. That's funny. However, the music takes the biscuit. The theme tune is a rip off of The Good, the bad and the Ugly and no one except for the great Ed Wood in Jail Bait has ever used music so completely clueless. 20 or 30 minutes less and the film would have been acceptable.
