Although its four sequels probably would give the viewer a real death wish, the original and best in the series is more commendable than it is made out to be. Charles Bronson plays Paul Kersey, an architect whose wife and daughter are violently attacked and raped. His rage vents to the streets of the city as he takes down other lowlifes in the classic vigilante motivation. Bronson's monotone approach actually fits his character and his character's actions very well. When the viewer thinks about it, the plot of "Death Wish" isn't nearly as overblown as other films of the "revenge fantasy" genre. The movie was a hit and made Bronson a star relatively late in his career. A great formula of action and drama.
