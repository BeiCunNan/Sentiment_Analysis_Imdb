really has very little horror. I can't belive another title for this was night of the demon, because there is no demons in sight. Instead we get the great Jody driving through the opening credits, then he stops for gas, then he pulls into a driveway where he sits down for lunch (oh god the horror). And as fast as it starts out it even gets better as he meets Melissa Strickland and they start the first of their many clunky diolog scenes together. She introduces him to her "wink" parents and perceives to invite him to stay despite her "parents" wishes. I can not believe he stayed in the first place considering the look on the face of the parents. I would have gotten the clue that I was not really welcome. She then gets the nob to stay awhile. Well he goes to the room set aside for him and meets Melissa's sister (she didn't age as well as Melissa). In the end you find out there is a fish in a lake, the guy says Zah to scare people, the guy refuses to believe she is a witch till the very end (and frankly I still don't think he really believes), and both end up in the clutches of satan.
