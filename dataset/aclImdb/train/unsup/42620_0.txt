One of the most boring shows on CBC. I don't know why CBC has to try to ape the American talk shows ( which they are far better at). George ST....( He should abbreviate his name) has zero charisma with no sense of humour and dresses in the same black is supposedly trendy clothes. He rarely asks insightful questions. Talk shows actually do better on radio where you don't have to see the host or the focus is on the guest rather than the interviewer. The Hour is too egocentric and what bothers me is that the CBC wastes valuable money and time on a show that at best belongs after midnight with all the late night time filler shows. I don't know what the ratings are like but the only thing worst than this show are probably the commercials. I actually watched 3 different shows of the Hour to try to give it a chance; if anything it just made me sicker of George WhatsHisName. He doesn't wear well on you.
