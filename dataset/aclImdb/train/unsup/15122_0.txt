If there ever was a case in point to make about Gangster/film art in history, L.G.F. would be one of 3 cases to put forward, the other 2 being,Get Carter & Layer Cake: I cant see why other IMDb-ers have commented on futility's such as, water running backwards in the swimming pool, when what you have here is the making of two screen idols, coupled with the teaming of probably the greatest film making talent in our history. The music/film score, Francis Monkmon (Sky) fame: Manic orchestral dizzy strings,coupled with the heavy saxophone solo's,puts this film tune theme, up there with the greats of Barry & Roy Budd inclusive: Super-stellar performances from Hoskins & Mirren, make this a must see No 3 of the Bulldog switchblade movies, before your soul, starts feeling the heat or touching the sides of your wooden crate: Helen Mirren (Probably the greatest British female treader of the boards, in our history). Was truly stupendous. Sexy,cohesive and method, on a very weak and poorly written part for her, demonstrated the ability of sheer acting genius: The story is self explanatory and does not require brain surgery to assimilate and nor should it: Now to my case in points 1. If it was not for the late great George Harrison(Same birthday as my dad!) and one or two others, this film would not have seen the light of day(Hand made films). 2. The beginning of the highly artistic 70s started with "Get Carter" the ending of the 70s Long Good Friday was born and subsequently, finished the off the decade! I rest my case in point, regarding the silly 60s. This IMDb was written on a Friday, a long hot sweltering one, wait a minute there's a knock on the door! "Oh hello Harold! Long time no see".
