I saw this film years ago, when it first came out at the cinema. Even after the first 10 minutes I found myself laughing at the apparently serious film. The special effects were bad - with the exception of a computer generated sequence at the end of the film, and the melting plasticine woman was good too...hmm. The low budget was especially visible when a MicrosoftÂ® Natual Keyboard is seen in the film, obviously a high-tech computer would need one. If you have nothing better to do and love anything sci-fi then watch it - you might get a laugh out of it.
