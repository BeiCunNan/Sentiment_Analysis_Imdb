***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Oh boy. Okay. Where do I begin? Oh, yeah. It sucked. It was awful, horrible, etc. Especially for me, being that I've been looking forward to this movie since they began talking about it. I am a huge Hellraiser fan, I own the first 5 on DVD, but I somehow doubt that I'll be purchasing this one, maybe ask for it as a gift (but only to complete my collection.) So what else can I say about this movie? Well, I have to tell you, just seeing Ashley Laurence as Kirsty helped me get through the film. I always thought she was a talented and attractive actress, and I can see even 15 years later, she is still talented and beautiful. For the VERY limited screen time she has, she made me smile. Especially the sceenes in which she holds the puzzle box and talks to Pinhead...almost made me forget how much the rest of the movie blew. Almost. Let's see:the guy who played Trevor, Dean Winters, can not hold a movie by himself. He's not a terrible actor, but come on, he has no emotion. At all. But he was not the thing that pissed me off the most. What did that was the plot. This is NOT a Hellraiser movie. This is Dimension's way of trying to make some quick cash off of a once noble series. Come on, 1 and 2 are classics, 3 was average, 4 (though it got terrible reviews) was kinda fun, 5 was depressing but smart, but this: I can hardly describe this mess. Cenobites randomnly show up and disappear, Pinhead talks from in a puddle (?) and Kirsty is second billed in the credits, is in two scenes and about seven flashbacks. Amounting to about 10-12 minutes of screen time. (Also, the back of the box says she is trying to stop Pinhead, when she actually is very civil with him, in one whopping flashback.)*Spoilers Ahead* I have to admit, one of the reasons I kept watching this was to find out if Kirsty was really dead. I kept doubting it, and I guessed the ending (mainly because a flashback in the first 20 minutes showed it)and was happy she lived. But am I really supposed to expect that she killed those people? Is that even what did happen? It was all very confusing. *End of Spoilers* In conclusion, this is a movie you might (but probably won't) enjoy if you are not a fan of the early Hellraisers. I give this 2/10, just for the smile that Ashley Laurence brought to my face.
