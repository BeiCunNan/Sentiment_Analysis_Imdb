This is a film that deserves to be seen. Though it is getting no publicity, WORD OF MOUTH, should serve this very special film. A solid performance by Sam<br /><br />Jackson and all of the supporting cast. Bob Rafelson, a very famous director of such classics as FIVE EASY PIECES and THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS<br /><br />TWICE, has brought his talents to this movie. It looks fantastic too. As in most film noir movies, like the "Big Sleep", there are story holes occasionally, but the acting, tension, dark humor and fast pace, keep you interested always. There is nothing boring. If you like dark movies with tough minded actors, this will not disapoint you.<br /><br />This movie reminds you of so many good films that Bogart and Bacall made. I give thumbs up and a 10 !
