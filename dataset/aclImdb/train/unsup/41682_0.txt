well... i expected much of this film, since i think Antonio Banderas is a great actor, too bad the other actors, director and editors were horrible. the movie was quite boring, very few dancing scenes, the hip hop dancers aren't dancers at all. and on top of all that the editing of this movie was amateur work, i was shocked with all the microphone thing, throughout the whole movie you can see the microphones used on the set, someone REALLY screwed up at the editing. it's a lousy plot, and the only good dancing scene was between Banderas and the hot blonde, the rest was very mediocre. this movie is maybe good for teenage girls under 18, but not for older people. it's a waste of time and money... wait till it's on cables to see it
