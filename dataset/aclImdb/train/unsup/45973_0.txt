I must admit that whilst I easily forgot about it straight after seeing it,it wasn't hard to class this poor man's Long Good Friday as one of the worst films of 1997. It was blissfully short,but,quite frankly,this low grade tripe is just 83 minutes too long.The whole thing is just so amateur and over zealous it winds up a self indulgent mess ,serving as a poor mistake which headed in one direction,then went one cropper the other way. Despite this,however,there was one good joke in it which I still remember after all this time,about the squirrel in the forest. No wait,that was poor too.Everything about this drivel reeks.
