I too saw this movie, possibly 6 times as a teenager at the movies, my friend had the Album soundtrack, which we listened to and cried. I've also been searching for this movie, if anyone knows how or where to get it, please let me know. I'd love to share this story with my daughter and nieces, I've recently lost my sister to cancer and this story brought back memories for us all. If only they would release this on DVD, I have a feeling there would be a lot of sales, perhaps someone could release it with the proceeds to go to the fight for cancer, there's a thought for someone. It's an inspirational movie that would be good not only for the cancer sufferer but for the family of the victim as well.
