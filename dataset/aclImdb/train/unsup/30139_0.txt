When Olivier Stone is dead and gone.When his films have been long buried somewhere in the forgotten vaults of history...one 3 minute film clip from all of Stone's work will stand tall,like a giant Redwood. What is this film clip ? The film clip of Leonard Cohen singing the words to the song FUTURE as the credits roll by...." GIVE ME CRACK AND ANAL SEX,TAKE THE TREE THAT'S LEFT,STUFF IT UP YOUR CULTURE,GIVE ME BACK THE BERLIN WALL,GIVE ME STALIN AND ST. PAUL,I'VE SEEN THE FUTURE,BROTHER,IT IS MURDER...." This segment may mark the end of the film,but will live forever.The movie dissolves into Cohen's lyrics and the lyrics dissolve into the black abyss. And you have found the song to play as you cut your wrists.
