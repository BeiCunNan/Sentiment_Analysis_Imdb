Absolutely great film, one of the best I have ever seen. Great director, great actors, great story, great music. But it s not film for everyone, as you can see in the rating. Lot of people gave it 10 or 9, but also lot of people gave it 1,2 or 3. One of the most controversial films ever, but everyone i have told about it, said it was super. It is a love story, it is action film, it is drama it is everything. Tommy Lee Jones stars like never before and Woody Harrelson with Juliette Lewis are also super. It s a film about violence, but against violence and it has a lot of hidden messages, so you must see it more times to understand it all. Personally i have seen it three times and it s not a final number.
