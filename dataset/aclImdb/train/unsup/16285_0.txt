I agree with others about elements of this story which seem anachronistic to Sherlock Holmes. The fingerprinting was definitely jarring. What makes Holmes so brilliant is that he was able to find criminals without the help of any technology. My only other real problem with this story was the incredibly terrible make-up job done on Holmes for his disguise! That was the only moment that was laughable and took me out of the story. Please! Who wouldn't know there was something weird about that face? Jeremy Brett had much more convincing disguises in the 1980s. Speaking of Jeremy Brett, he was so brilliant that it is difficult to see any other actor in the role of Holmes. However, Ruper Everett does a great job of creating his own kind of Holmes. He gives off a much younger energy (which also made the much later time frame seem odd), but definitely captures the aloofness & arrogance of Holmes. He was a pleasure to watch. Ian Hart was a hoot as Watson. The two actors play very well off each other and there were some quite funny scenes. The story wasn't bad. It didn't give anything away too soon like a lot of mysteries have been doing lately. The atmosphere was spooky and there was a tension throughout the story that kept your attention. This production was not particularly accurate with regards to the Holmes stories, but it was an enjoyable program and is worth watching.<br /><br />PS- I was very sad to read in another review that the BBC won't be doing any more Murder Rooms. Now THOSE are some great stories!
