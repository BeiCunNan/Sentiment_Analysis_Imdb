After watching another title in the Afterdark HorrorFest series and really enjoying it, I thought I would give Tooth and Nail a try. Now I have seen a lot of bad movies over the years, this has definitely got to be the worst. I am surprised Michael Madsen and Vinne Jones even agreed to appear in this turkey. I am thinking it must have been shot on a really tight budget as we were constantly shown the same shots from the outside, and also the same areas inside the building, despite the building being huge.<br /><br />There is no atmosphere, the acting is worse then terrible, there is no<br /><br />pace,and very little in the way of action.And the least scary 'bad guys' you are ever likely to see.<br /><br />A plot, which could have had a lot of potential, which was full of promise in the blurb,was truly worse then terrible. And when played out on screen it was so so so predictable. This movie should be avoided at all costs, as you will be cheated out of time you will never get back.
