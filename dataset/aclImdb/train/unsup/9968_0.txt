Joey (Embry) has it all (good job, beautiful wife, good house, etc) including a gambling problem that effects everyone in his life.<br /><br />Some people have the travel gene  they need to go everywhere; some people have the gambling gene  they need to put something on the line..they get a rush they say. And, some people don't understand those that have the travel and/or the gambling gene. Seems to me that once one has seen almost everything one might get tired of the things one must do to do all that traveling. Apparently not. They still go here and there at the drop of a hat. <br /><br />And, one would also think that those who gamble and do not win as often as they would like would get the message that things are really not going to get better, and in fact they can get a lot worse. That's what this movie is all about.<br /><br />However, if you are going to make a movie about the pitfalls of gambling, don't make the ending all nice like it was all worth it. It really is not worth it, and may give some gamblers false hope that all will be okay later on. That's my only beef with this movie, otherwise it is extremely good.<br /><br />Violence: Yes.
