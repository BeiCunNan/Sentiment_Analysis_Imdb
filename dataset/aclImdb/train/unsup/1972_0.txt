Two scientists are at frozen Arctic research station: one goes about his daily work routine, the other slowly goes off the deep end trying to figure out how the two men there before them died. <br /><br />Great obscure little made for TV movie, something like a hybrid between "The Thing" and "The Shining" (even though that movie was still several years away from being made). I've only ever seen this on TV once, it was back in 1995 or 1996, and it was under the name "A Cold Night's Death", but I've still got it on video.<br /><br />I hate to say this but I hope this movie isn't issued on video or DVD, the fact that it IS so rarely seen and it's more obscure and therefore a little more of a surprise when (if) you can see it. It would seem to lose some the suspense to it if you could just simply go into any corporate owned "Blockbuster" type of video store and rent it anytime you wanted to see it.<br /><br />The obscurity of this movie is also part of it's charm.<br /><br />*** out of ****
