I also saw this movie at a film festival in Philadelphia. I knew it was going to be bad when the presenter of the film described it as a "guilty pleasure." To me, a guilty pleasure is some awful movie you sit through just because one of the performers is hot. And I guess that's what happened here, except I didn't even really find the cowboy to be that hot with his fake southern accent. I think both he and the actress who played the wife are decent actors, but any actor, good or bad, would choke on the lines these poor actors were given... I wanted to walk out but had made the mistake of sitting in the middle of the row, and so to be polite to my neighbors, I sat through it all. As if the directing, writing, acting, music, sets, lighting, and cinematography all were not bad enough, this film actually adds insult to injury by introducing an unnecessary plot detail in the final moments that makes the already flimsy plot absolutely incomprehensible. Best I can say about this is that if you're in the mood for a stunningly amateur movie, this could be fun to mock, if you're not trapped in a darkened theater where you're expected to be respectful.
