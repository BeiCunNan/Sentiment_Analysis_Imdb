I was glad to see a movie where nothing explodes, no one gets shot, where the characters are well, regular people doing their best to keep it together...<br /><br />Lobster farm tells the story of a small business and the family that defines it. Or maybe it's the other way aroundÂ… As the plot and characters are introduced we begin to see how closely the identity of the individuals and of the family as a whole are tied to their small business.<br /><br />Through the day to day routines and an unusual string of events, we discover each person and a chance to see ourselves.<br /><br />One by one, we get both a comedic and quirky peek into their individual stories leading in to a more serious look at the gravity of what family business and the family are faced with.<br /><br />All in all , because of the story, the acting and the direction, Lobsterfarnm feels very real. It makes you laugh like your laughing with family. It makes you worry like you would about your own. Ultimately it paints a portrait of a family with all it's facets that is a real gem.
