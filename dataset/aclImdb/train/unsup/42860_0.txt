Considering all the praise this movie received, I was deeply disappointed. It doesn't look or feel like a star wars movie at all. I felt like I was watching some cheap 80's excuse of an action movie made in Mexico. One thing that really turned me off is the music. It's not even real music- it's like a midi alternative! I mean it comes up with STAR WARS and a midi sequence of the star wars song. How extremely cheap!<br /><br />The next thing is the characters. None of them were star wars like at all. The emperor's hand made me nauseous. She looked like some Gothic chick at a local high school. There is nothing to make her look like she is from the star wars galaxy. I know I sound sexist in this next comment but I'm really not. There are too many female roles in this film! Whoever made it must be really up on girl power or something. And the female roles are done poorly. In the star wars movies, they were mainly either politicians or Jedi, all dressed in a very star-warsish way, most of them some other form of aliens. None of them were wearing loads of makeup, kinky clothes, or anything like that. Plus how could you have a female play an evil sith? only a male character would properly fill that role. I don't have anything against women, but it just doesn't produce the right effect. Especially one of those hot-stuff, "I'm a girl with an attitude" kind of characters. They just don't exist in star wars. It's like trying to make a big burly guy play the role of a fairy princess, only without the humor.<br /><br />ANd there are too many human characters and not enough aliens. put some effort into costumes!<br /><br />Even Star Wars: Broken Allegience is a better fan-made film than this, and that one sucked too. At least Broken Allegience was pretty on-point as far as the star wars feeling is concerned, but it seemed more like a power-ranger episode as the show progressed. This one was no better.<br /><br />That was the biggest waste of 20,000 dollars to make it, people, and a waste of download time on my part.
