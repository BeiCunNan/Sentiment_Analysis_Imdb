Good job on all accounts. I do agree Kovalchuk was the weakest link in this production - she is just too young and inexperienced to play such a difficult part. Galibin was amazing as Master, his voice and movements are captivating. The rest of the cast was comprised of experienced and great performers, and they all worked very hard on the roles they were entrusted with. Dubbing instead of the recording during the shoot is actually an old technique used by great filmmakers in the past. It is very tedious and hard on actors but it ensures the best tone and intonation the actor can deliver for the particular moment and lines. It has nothing to do with Soviet era movies. If it sounds unnatural, it means the actor is not experienced in this craft and is not a good actor. Unfortunately, Ms. Kovalchuk completely failed that part, her tone and voice sounded very dull and unnatural. Other than that, I enjoyed watching this movie. Even my non-Russian speaking American husband watched the movie with a great deal of interest.
