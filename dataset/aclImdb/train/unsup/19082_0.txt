Not a bad action/thriller.<br /><br />A bit slow for a action movie, and not quite thrilling enough for a thriller. Still the action sequences were well done and some of the fighting sequences verged on excellent.<br /><br />The story was slightly far fetched and tho the writers tried for twists it was really very straight forward.<br /><br />Jean Reno was good as always and I thought Jocelyn Quivrin was excellent.<br /><br />This movie was like a cross between "the borne identity", "seven" and 100 average cop movies.<br /><br />Worth a watch id you like Jean Reno.
