Man...what can I say about this film? When I saw the cast included Richard Hatch, and the King Of B-Movies Tim Thomerson, I thought it had potential. I was wrong. Almost immediately, from the look of the film, I could see it was low-budget. Still I held out hope. Then I saw how cheesy the prop "artifacts" looked, I smelled trouble. Upon seeing how weak the monster effects were, I KNEW I was in trouble. Only some classic B-movie gratuitous nudity could redeem this film (hopefully from Cindy Pena, who plays a Native-American guide), but once again I was disappointed. If you see this film on the shelf at your local store, RUN. It has poor production, a weak plot, and generally poor acting performances...
