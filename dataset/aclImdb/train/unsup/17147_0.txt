Grendel, Grendel, Grendel is a truly fantastic animated film based on the monster Grendel in the ancient Beowolf legend. It is one of my all time favourite films. The film is viewed from the point of view of Grendel the monster. He's one of those big, burly, wise, innocent and doomed monsters that legends are made of. The film works on a variety of levels. The visuals are great - bold deep colours. The soundtrack is ultra lounge and very James Bond. The story is wonderful. It is entertaining and deep, funny and sad, and has wisdom and wit thrown in as well. It's never dull, cutesy or mundane. The depth of the story, its smooth and quite referencing to wider stories, legends and theories allows interesting interpretations from a range of perspectives - mythological, historical, or psychoanalytical. It is a feel good movie with depth, design and spark. If you ever get to see the film then make sure you do.
