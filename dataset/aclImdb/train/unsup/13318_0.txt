I saw this film last year and just knew it would be successful! I was very glad to see that it won some awards, it definitely deserves the attention. The storyline is so original, it makes you want to watch it more than once! I have never seen another film showing 2 different points of view to the same situation - very creative! The characters are very believable in each situation, and my favorite scene is when the black woman starts yelling in the parking lot - she is absolutely hysterical!! I laughed so hard I cried and I think I even heard my husband snort, although he denies it. KUDOS to the writer and director on such a wonderful short film! I will keep an eye out for other films done by these writers/directors. Congratulations on a winner.
