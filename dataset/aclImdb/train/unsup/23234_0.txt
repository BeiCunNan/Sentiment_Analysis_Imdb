Richard Rayond did a phenomenal job in the directing of "The Bridge." It is a FANTASTIC movie. Andrea Corr, the lead actress whom played Mary, is a force to be reckoned with, she is incredible, she portrays her character so well, she IS her!! This movie is a perfect mix of emotion and intrigue, compelling it's viewers into a new dimension. We give it a 10 out of 10 stars, it is PURE PERFECTION, an absolute masterpiece!! Anyone who gets the chance to see this wonderful short film, please do!!! You will be inspired from beginning to end, there is no stopping it. It was also the official selection at several film festivals. A+++++! Alisha & Lisa
