I enjoy People's Court, although I prefer Judge Judy's no-nonsense approach to the foolishness of so many of the litigants.<br /><br />So glad to see others commenting on Curt's behavior. I haven't really noticed the touching, but his ridiculous smart-alecky comments, akin to the old no-win question "So, have you stopped beating your wife?," are just childish and way beyond irritating. He's practically making faces and saying "I know you are but what am I?" like an eight-year old on the playground. Harvey's comments, while silly at times, at least have some measure of thought and truth behind them.<br /><br />It's absolutely jarring to go from Judge Milian's classy, professional courtroom session to the buffoonish antics out in the hallway. It cheapens the whole show, and he adds nothing at all to it. The show should follow the example of Judge Judy and Divorce Court - let the people make their own comments afterward. As we see every day, they make better fools out of themselves just by opening their mouths than Curt's curt comments ever could. The only one he makes look bad is himself.
