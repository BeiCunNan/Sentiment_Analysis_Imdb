People are reviewing this movie as if it was the John Woo masterpiece "Hardboiled". It is NOT. The cover art is misleading and so is the back. This movie is as some have pointed out a boring no action light hearted 80s HK cop film. There is almost no action and I don't think there are 2 guns in the movie let alone in his hands at one time. The movie HardBoiled that most people are referring to with the hospital gun battle, etc. is awesome. This movie is far from it and video stores should be ashamed as displaying this movie for anything other then it is. My friend rented it thinking it would be hardboiled, it of course wasn't, even though the clerk at the store assured him it was and said he had rented it before. IGNORE the high rating on this site ppl are reviewing the wrong movie. This one sucks bad, avoid at all costs.
