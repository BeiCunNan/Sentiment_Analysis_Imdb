I like Akshay Khanna. Thas was the only reason i decided to watch this film and i'm happy i did. "Shaadi Se Pehle" was a very pleasant surprise, and i usually don't like these kind of mindless comedy's. But the story is pretty original and unoriginal at the same time. A couple of jokes in the film are really hilarious, almost as if the great, late Mehmood himself wrote the script.<br /><br />Akshay Khanna is very good as usual. Although the wig he's wearing makes him look a little gay. Sunil Shetty is really a comedy actor, he should lay of the action flicks altogether. The two female leads look very pretty and do a OK job. Aftaab Shivdasani's acting was below average. I loved the special appearance by Gulshan Grover, him doing kind of a parody of his earlier "bad man"-character, though i'm not so sure if it was intentional or not.<br /><br />The songs are time-pass only. They should have cut of at least two of the songs and make the film a little shorter.<br /><br />7/10.. After Malamaal Weekly, this is the best Hindi comedy of the year so far!
