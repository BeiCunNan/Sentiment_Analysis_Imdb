When first saw Pet Cemetery II I wasn't expecting anything that would come close to the original, and I was right. First off the film isn't anything like the original the only thing remaining from the first film is the pet cemetery all other aspects of the first that made it good have been changed. The plot is basically a kid and his father move back to the town after the death of their mother/ex-wife, the kids makes friends with another kid who's dog dies and they bury it in the cemetery, well I think you know the rest. The predictability of the entire plot was just sad, I mean I could guess exactly what would happen next. The acting was average nothing horrible, nothing special. The film although directed by the person from the first was nothing like the first, whereas the first film used suspense and dark atmosphere with only very minor gore effects, The second film skips the suspense and atmosphere and goes straight for the gore, It seems like the director wanted to go in a different direction with this film in order to make it more action-packed, it really doesn't work. Overall this film ends up being everything the first wasn't, predictable, weak and just downright stupid. If your a fan of the original I wouldn't recommend this to you at all considering all the things you loved about the first have disappeared in this one.
