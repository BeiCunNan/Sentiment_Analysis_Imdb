Boy, can Jules Delorme turn crap into uber-crud or what? I'm guessing they cast him as a zombie on the misunderstanding he was acting, and when they swapped him to Ulysses and realised it wasn't an act... it was too late, the budget was blown.<br /><br />The film itself has a bunch of funny nods to the zombie flick tradition and with a decent lead it might have stood a chance. If you're tempted to see this film, just bang your head against a wall for ten minutes instead. You'll end up with that same ache behind the eyes and unanswered 'WHY LORD?!' and it'll have taken far less of your time to get there.<br /><br />Be warned.<br /><br />Mark
