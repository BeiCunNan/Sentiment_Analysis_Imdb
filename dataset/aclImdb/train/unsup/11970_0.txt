A dream of a kid? Remember the bum who sell manuals? If the story about Sing really happens, bum shall be some 20 years older than he first showed up when Sing was a small kid. But at the ending part, he looks the same age with before, trying to sell some "more powerful" kung fu manuals. There may be other explanations, but to read this part in a real-life way, it means he is the one who is selling dream manuals, and Sing is just like normal people who just bought one and then,made a dream.<br /><br />Most importantly, the changing age of adult Sing and the Deaf girl back to young kid at the ending part gave a huge hint that they still at their kid age throughout the movie. The Butt boy, Bucktooth Jane, tailor, landlord etc showed in the end also implies that they are not legendary guys in the movie, they are just normal people like u and me. All the stories are a dream done by young Sing. He has evil minds indeed, but he wishes to be a good guy, he wishes greater power will happen to him so that can save at least his girlfriend, and then if possible, save the world. This is a dream not only for him, it is a dream for all movie fans, and also a dream for people in normal life.<br /><br />We go to theatres so we also have dreams. This film is 10 out of 10, because it gives us many implications. One of them is: there are many ways to make a dream. Don't know how? Here is one!
