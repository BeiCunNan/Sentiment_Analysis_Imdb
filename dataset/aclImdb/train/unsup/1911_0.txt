All the people and every thing appeared in this movie, is going wild and freely on their own way,and having no care about anything bit. Calling Africa, Drivin'a Lift-Up car, Lobster, Nuclear- Shelter, Wedding party, Machine-Gun, Love, Race, Sound, T-Shirts, and Summer. This movie and O.C.and Stiggs DO everything!! And it's a kind of Rock'n Roll much more than ;Beavis& Butt-head;Wayne&Garth;Bill&Ted I love this. I write again.
