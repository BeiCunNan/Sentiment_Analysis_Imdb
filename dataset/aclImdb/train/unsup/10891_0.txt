Ignore the people drinking the Hatorade, this show is so quotable it almost hurts. I can't believe I missed it the first time around.<br /><br />Philby, you need to define your love of "British comedy". I mean, you end you end your critique with a bastardisation of a worn out catch phrase from an unfunny commercial by Telstra (the equivalent of British Telecom), and as such I advise readers to take such opinions with a grain of salt.<br /><br />The comedy writing here is top notch. As for comparisons with The Office or the Boosh, the fact that Steve and Julian appear in episodes might lead one to think that they were fans of the show as well, yes?
