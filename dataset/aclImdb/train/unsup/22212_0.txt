First of all, I don't quite understand why all these people have been saying this is a "lesser" film by Keaton! I think it's a fast energetic and hilarious film, that shows Keaton to be in fine form! Now, when I called this film my favorite by Keaton some might agrue, that's not the "correct" choice. One MUST say they love "The General" or "Sherlock Jr." While I do think both films are great and funny. But there's something about this one that I enjoy just a bit more. I like the film's spirit. As everyone mentions there are several funny moments in this film. If your a Keaton fan, you should definitely see this one. If you've never seen a Keaton film, I personally think this is a wonderful place to start. **** out of ****
