Jet Lag is a romantic comedy. It follows all the usual routes, but offers great acting and good humour all the way.<br /><br />Juliette Binoche is Rose, a thirtysomething who is finally taking control of her life and leaving her abusive boyfriend Sergio (Sergi Lopez).<br /><br />Jean Reno is Felix. A frazzled businessman on his way to re-kindle his romance with an old flame.<br /><br />However when a strike and fog halt all flights in Charles de Gaulle the two meet cute and end up spending the evening together. Of course we know they are made for each other, but thats not the point. Its not where they end up its how they get there.<br /><br />Jet Lag opens with huge energy and a real sense of airport chaos. It then focuses in on the duo in on a hotel room as they spend time together trading insults and exchanging banter. The dialogue is sparkling and the performances spot on.<br /><br />Then ineveitably their planes take off and they go their seperate ways... or do they?<br /><br />Thompsons film is a breath of fresh air with Juliette Binoche a revelation in a totally "un-binoche" role. She is cheap and common with a heart of gold. Reno is very much her comic foil, and glerefully allows her the lime light.<br /><br />Jet Lag is a refreshing take on an old format. It will not suffer on the small screen either so catch it on DVD!
