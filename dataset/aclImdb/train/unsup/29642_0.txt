In the updated reversed version of "Guess who's coming to dinner" Ashton Kutcher is the white man that his black girl brings home to her parents. Her father Percy Jones (Bernie Mac) is off put that she brought home this honky ass cracker, and precedes to goad Aston into telling off color jokes, go cart racing, and other things. This film was rather unfunny, didn't have anything profound to say like the previous version, in matter of fact, it doesn't do much of anything well at all. A better updated version of "Guess Who" would be to keep Ashton as the boyfriend, but replace the parents with Demi Moore & Bruce Willis (get rid of the girlfriend part). THAT I'd pay to see ( this I just caught on Encore). Yea i know, my hypothetical film as great as it would be would NEVER be made.. However with the success of "Brokedown Mountain" (critical NOT financial), I think I know what the next version of "Guess Who" is going to be and may god help us all. But I digress, back to this movie. This film is best summed up in two words: SUPREMELY forgettable.<br /><br />My Grade: D
