The Karate Kid, Part II (1986) was unavoidable. You know after the success of the first installment there was going to be a sequel. The cash cow franchise wasn't going to be denied this time around (eventually the kitty would run dry by Part Three). Oh well, here we go...<br /><br />Mr. Miyagi learns about an illness in his family and has to leave for his home island of Okinawa. Young (I use this term very loosely this time around) Danny can't bear to not be at his mentor's side and travels with him. While in Okinawa, we learn about the closet full of skeletons that Mr. Miyagi had left behind. His old friend/nemesis greets him upon his return. Sato (an Hawaiian playing a Japanese guy) is angry with him about something that happened to them many years ago (and I do mean many, I thought I can hold a long grudge). Not only that but Young Danny also happens to make a mean enemy (can't he ever get a break?). Will Danny and Mr. Miyagi over come the odds as they fight side by side? Will Sato takes something for that nasty constipation (watch the movie, you'll know what I mean)? You have to watch . The Karate Kid, Part II.<br /><br />Okay, here's my big gripe with this movie (and others like it). How come whenever two character are "speaking" to each other in a foreign language, why must they speak to each other in broken English? <br /><br />For Karate Kid fans only
