To put it simply: a lack of respect. GAME OF DEATH: THE ROBERT CLOUSE VERSION ranks (in two senses of the word) right alongside Ed Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. Clouse and Wood weren't the first graverobbers on the scene, to be sure, but they both came away from the boneyard with unclean hands. Like Burke and Hare, they was just lookin' to pocket some loose change. Which they did. Nor were they alone. Years after the fact, DRAGON: THE BRUCE LEE STORY (based, we're told, on Clouse's own book) would come along and reopen the old wound(s). Like most Bruce Lee fans, I suffered through the seemingly endless exploitation cycle that began the moment he died. It wasn't easy, because not a single one of the purported bioflix came anywhere near the Truth. DRAGON likewise created its own distorted "reality," with yet another wannabe look-alike choreographed through yet more over-the-top, badly done fight scenes that did nothing more than add yet another layer of tarnish to the memory of a man who deserves better. GAME OF DEATH is an insult to the intelligence. Now that we have BRUCE LEE: A WARRIOR'S JOURNEY, there's no need to even go back and revisit this one.
