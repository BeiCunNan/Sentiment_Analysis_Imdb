I saw this film on TV back in the early '80's. The fantasy-ography about the childhood of Hans Christian Anderson is a work done with the same level of attention that one would see in the works done by Walt Disney.<br /><br />The adventures and stories of the young boy are the only things that transcend the animation in this work. The film blends some of the story elements of Anderson's works with his childhood -- specifically THE RED SHOES -- and the selfish daughter of the town mayor. The score of this film is wonderfully moving -- equal to that of a genuine opera. The boy's telling of the final sequence -- THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL -- was so emotionally moving, that it brought tears to my eyes. Of all the films about Hans Christian Anderson, this one is without question, one of the best. It puts the Danny Kay version to shame by comparison. <br /><br />AT LAST! It's on DVD/video.
