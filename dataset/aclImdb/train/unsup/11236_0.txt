Asoka is tender story of a great emperor. what i love about it is beautiful, mystifying music. combination of good looking and professional actors is a good advantage of the movie. this movie is not like the rest of the hindi movies. usually, hindi movies target India and neighboring countries and gulf (arab) countries as well. since this one is VERY well done, I think this time the audience will include Europe (it was a great success in England) and USA (Shahrukh Khan himself came to NY). Shahrukh Khan was voted as the sexiest man in Asia and his partner is considered as the sexiest babe in India, a grandaughter of a dynasty of actors in India. if u like professionally made quality movies, if u like some chemistry, romance, love combined with action in battlefield, excellent music and hot actors in a meaningful movie, ASOKA is definitely yours. u gotta watch it for sure then. trust on my word.
