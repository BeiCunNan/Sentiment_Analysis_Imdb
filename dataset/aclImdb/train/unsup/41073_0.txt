"The Party" had some amusing moments in the beginning of the film but toward the end it degenerated into what Hollywood writers would call a mad-capped romp. It was a goofy, goofy ending with a sappy component. Towards the end the "young people" crash the party looking like they were dressed in fashions from Target. Most of the characters were cliches and Peter Sellers' portrayal of Hrundi V. Bakshi would be considered in todays political climate as racist. At the time he was considered funny and his character was cute. The music, dancing and ending were so goofy and portrayal of the "young people" almost insulting that it is no wonder an anti-establishment movement was flourishing at the time. The producers were clueless about what was happening around them and the portrayal of their generation in this movie was probably right on.
