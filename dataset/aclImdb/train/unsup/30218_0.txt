So it's 7am and I'm barely awake on a Monday morning and just flipping through the channels, minding my own business, when along comes this short that put me in the best frame of mind for the week. No spoilers, but I loved the turn-about on the old peep show theme. I was wondering how it would end and the surprise is definitely worth the nine minutes, but the entire short is hilarious. Check Cinemax listings for showing in August and September of 2000. Do not miss taping this one.
