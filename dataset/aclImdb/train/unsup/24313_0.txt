First, i'm a fan of stop motion because I grew up on Gumby and i have also experienced using it. It is some of the most time consuming film work I have ever used. It calls for more patience than I have, so the film was short.<br /><br />Second, the show is actually funny. It has it's moments of stupidity, but it is well done, has a low-budget look to it, though it is a very expensive show, and will spoof off of many shows no one under...oh, about 25 will get. I happen to get it because I grew up watching mostly re-runs of these shows. I recommend it to most people, but some won't like it. It is sort of edgy with it's humor, so you might be offended.<br /><br />But it did start with a TV-14 rating, and then shocked me with it's TV-MA rating. But, at times it does deserve it. Great show. ten out of ten
