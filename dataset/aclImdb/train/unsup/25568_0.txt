I swear I love Norm Macdonald I think he is a great comedic talent. Right up there with Denis Leary,but this movie (I will not call it a Film) was horrible. This was one of those movies like "Joe Dirt" where they had maybe one or two funny ideas and they built a whole movie around it. I really hope his next effort will be more thought out.
