For a small independent film musical about a cross-dresser, overweight girl with a wired jaw, cute but screwed up teen, OTT drama queen and a doormat femme fatale...CAMP is an overwhelmingly good film.<br /><br />The title aside, which may turn many people off the idea of watching the movie, the music is brilliant and after two months since I saw it I still cannot get one of the songs outta my head...Country Plant it's called.<br /><br />A wonderful host of newcomer talent who all deserve to have great careers ahead of them and ignore the title, the film is bloody funny!
