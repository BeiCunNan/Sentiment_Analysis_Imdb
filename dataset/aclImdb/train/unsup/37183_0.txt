I almost feel bad about writing something bad about this, considering the other comments made, but I feel I should carry on. No, I haven't seen this film but after watching the trailer for it, I think I have enough reason to hate it.<br /><br />Firstly, I have no recollection of this being set in America (in fact the first book in the series is set in Cornwall... ENGLAND.). I can understand why it is set in America, so 20th Century Fox can make it sell there and they can get more money. I don't care, that is the first thing that has ruined it for me.<br /><br />Secondly - and in relation to my first point - This is set in the country side, in a little village (again in England) which gives it that fantastic air to it, of seclusion and intensity. "Will is like any other boy" doesn't cut it. He goes to school in what looks like a big city, has stupid brothers who don't seem to care about him as they do in the book. Oh, and the part in the shopping mall? Stupid commercial idiots.<br /><br />All I can say is, that I don't want to go and see a film about a barley pubescent boy who "can barley talk to girls". That's not what the book is about. The only good thing to say about this film is, it has Christopher Eccleston in it, so maybe next time when they re-make it better, set in England with out the stupid commercial, American-ness they'll have him again.
