FANAA what can i say? this movie has never been done before! on the outside the package looks like a masala bollywood film but in reality it is truly a Hindi film. Romance laced with terrorist and blind girl, high end nuclear weapons, and a sweet child in the mix in the snow-caps of Poland (where the shooting took place). Pure genius of Indian cinema. Was never a big fan of Aamir Khan's until this film something about his portrayal as Rehan completely floored me as none of his other performances has! Kajol as usual is wonderful, sexy, and packs a punch with the emotion she excludes. Their son in the film is adorable and hope so see this child in more films! The director and producer have done an amazing job packaging this film and it's timing is relevant. When love always wins, the love b/w Rehan and Zooni wins only when a mortal sacrifice is made. Yashraj Films has definitely changed the face of romances with this one just as is did with DDLJ and Kajol's so-called comeback is smashing as her breakthrough in DDLJ! Best wishes to the team of Fanaa for a impactive film!
