I fell in love with this movie because of its brilliant actors, beautiful photography, intense atmosphere (ranging from serene to depressing) and last but not least because of the main musical theme. During the credits at the end there is an extra goody: THE song is performed once more - this time by Heather Nova. It has been released as a single cd in Germany, but I could not find it anywhere in the U.S.A. during my vacation. So now you know where you need to search.<br /><br />See this movie, you will not regret it!
