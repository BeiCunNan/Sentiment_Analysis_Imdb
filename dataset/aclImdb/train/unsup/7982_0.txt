This movie was atrocious. I got in for free and I walked out. This is one of those movies that would never have been made if the writer didn't know some famous people. Joe Pantoliano whines his way through the movie, spouting diatribes about what big losers he and his friends are. Of course he is a writer, a common conceit among the self-indulgent independent screenwriter/director crowd. He complains and complains about being a loser, despite the fact that his ex-wife and girlfriend are both hot, he has a bunch of friends, and has plenty of time to give out his diatribes, as well as an audience to listen to them. This self-indulgent trash was sickening and an insult to talented writers who can't get their films made because they don't have the ins with talented actors like Pantoliano. In fact, all the actors turn in fine performances, which is the only thing that comes close to saving this film. All things being equal though, go see something else.
