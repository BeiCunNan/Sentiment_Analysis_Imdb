Probably the worst of the 104 episodes aired during the four year run of the series; if not actually the worst it is a worthy contender. In many ways a recycling of the first season's "The Night of the Glowing Corpse" but without an interesting villain like "Ironfoot". <br /><br />Also inexplicably missing is any female eye candy, a device that could at least be counted on to serve as a pleasant distraction during other sub-par episodes of the series. Of course the series had incorporated an increasingly gay orientation by the final season.<br /><br />It's more diplomatic intrigue, this time a conspiring European embassy official; an underplaying Harvey Korman in a straight role with a sometimes Germanic sometimes Slavic accent. The idea is to embarrass President Grant with a faked Kinescope showing him signing a treaty with a Fu Manchu like character. <br /><br />Almost zero parody and an extremely lame and illogical collection of devices. These include the above-mentioned Kinescope, silhouettes of West and Gordon mounted on a moving toy train, the old moving wall and sloping floor trap, and the embassy's "safe" which is too silly to even bother describing.
