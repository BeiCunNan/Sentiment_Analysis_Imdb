This is not only a bad movie, it is yet another scary symptom of a sick society being pandered to by an exploitive and irresponsible film industry. The plot is idiotic. As happens again and again, it is based on corrupt, all powerful government. There is endless gun play (in which nobody ever seems to hit anything)and repeated gore. There is a totally gratuitous lesbian sex scene which has absolutely no bearing on the plot. If things aren't being riddled with bullets or pushed out of windows, they're blown up in fiery explosions. Why are the Brits able to do some real nail-biters without resorting to this sort of blam-blam sensationalism. And the Americans wonder why they have a firearms problem... I am a great believer that you get what you pay for in bargain bin movies at Walmart. But I keep hoping. I paid a buck fifty for this one and would consider myself ripped off except that by replacing the erase tab, I can re-use the tape. Almost anything I record on it will be better than this vulgar, violent cinematic vomit!
