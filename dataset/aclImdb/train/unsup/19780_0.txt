What do you get with a good story-line, an interesting cast, better than average special FX and apparently a pretty good budget?? Answer: a botched up horror/fantasy showing that there was definitely someone in charge who really didn't know what he was doing. It really is a shame because this film easily falls into the 'woulda - coulda - shoulda been' category. Not a total waste of time - but oh so disappointing...
