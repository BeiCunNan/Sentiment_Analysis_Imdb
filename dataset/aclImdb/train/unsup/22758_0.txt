"Two Killer has different ideals" is the main theme of this movie. More exactly it's the story of that book! After seeing this movie, it made me to read that book too. I like that movie because the actors can interpret what the character need them to act. Of course, the most important, the story line is quite good, moreover, it's not straight forward to give the movie theme to audience. We need to think after seeing it. To think the relationship between life and fate, to think about dreams of people, to know more about life of killer/Hit-man. May be in this movie owing to some limitation, like movie length, stars, etc, make audience sometimes confusing what's going on that as it's non-linear plot. Of course, movie cannot be describe so details as in book. After reading that book, it's really made me knowing the life of killer (Hit-man). More exciting and more details! Anyway, this movie is good although it's not easy to understand! Really recommend everyone to see it, of course, if possible, read the book!!
