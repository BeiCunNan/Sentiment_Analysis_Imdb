Nashville is awful. The songs are awful. The dialog is awful. This is a movie that only liberals in Hollywood could produce. It shows just how out of touch they are with real America. They don't understand country music and they think everyone loved the Kennedy's. The satire of this movie is so far off it makes sense only to the America haters. I am amazed that anyone could get through this sick attack on the South and good Americans. I liked MASH the movie, but the TV show sucked. I find nothing good about the point of view this movie takes. If you should happen see this movie in the TV listings, avoid it at all costs. This movie was an attempt to undermine conservative opinion of the time.
