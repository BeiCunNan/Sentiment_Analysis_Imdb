Julia Roberts is a one dimensional actress who was trying to take on a multi-dimensional role in this film and she failed miserably. She should have either stayed with the bad Irish accent or her natural dialogue because it drove me crazy as she went back and forth between the two. You could tell by looking at her face during the movie that she was way over her head. She was expressionless and emotionless throughout the film. This performance ranks right up there with Tinkerbelle as Julia's worst performance ever.<br /><br />John Malkovich was solid as Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde. He was not near as good as Fredric March in the 1931 version, but that is way too high of a measuring stick. I was somewhat districted from his performance by the awful job Julia Roberts was doing. I kept trying to guess if her next line would be an Irish or an American accent.<br /><br />The story could have been very interesting. It comes from a different point of view from the Robert Louis Stevenson novella. It tells the story of a woman who finds herself trying to choose between failing for the noble Dr. Jekyll or the infamous Mr. Hyde. It draws into a different side of human nature because a lot of women tend to be drawn to the dangerous type. Unfortunately, this movie called for a strong actress to play Mary Reilly and they were stuck with Julia Roberts.<br /><br />One other issue that some might have with this film is you really must see a traditional version of Jekyll and Hyde first. The movie would probably be fairly hard to follow if you didn't because the movie assumes that you know the Jekyll and Hyde background.<br /><br />Finally, I will leave on a positive note. The settings were nice and atmospheric.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend that you avoid this film and watch the Rouben Mamoulian classic instead.
