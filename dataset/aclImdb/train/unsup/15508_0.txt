How Mr. De Palma can go from sublime to ridiculous, from Masterful to Childish in just a few seconds is beyond me! Always luscious in his obsessive photography, a visual standard-bearer of 'americana', in this film, "The Untouchables" what most annoys about Mr. De Palma is his almost pathological need to arouse our applause at all costs and at all times! And this obsession seems to 'infect' his actors... De Niro in particular, who really 'hams' up Scarface Capone. His hand mimicry makes him resemble an Airline Hostess giving Emergency Exit Instructions more than the notorious Italo-American Gangster. Unintentionally Funny! The 'final' rooftop chase scene is awkwardly childish, the 'Potiomkin' re-make goofy... Are we in Scorsese/Coppola/Naked Gun land? 3 out of 10 may seem very mean for so much time, trouble money and genuine talent put to waste but... When will baby Brian grow up, and cater for grown ups?
