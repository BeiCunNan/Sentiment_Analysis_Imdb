Everyone in this film takes it too seriously. Its not tongue in cheek at all, it looks like it thinks it's a real movie, which is what makes it so terrible. The actors look like they actually think that there's a croc near this lake... When clearly, and I mean, clearly, this is not the case. It's very likely that there was as much money thrown at this as there was at the opening titles of Superman, which I also watched today (thought 'was much better', incidentally).<br /><br />Oh, look, a fluffy white bunny rabbit! What the hell is such a clean rabbit doing at a dirty lake anyway? Schnieder looking in surprise at his poking stick after its been bitten off... Right after a 40 foot croc eats the pig on the other end of it? What did he expect? Maybe he's shocked that he accepted this script! If the FX weren't so horribly bad (I assume they were made on a Commodore 64) it wouldn't be so horrible (the script still needs some work), but they are so amateur and dated that the film simply can't be taken seriously at all, making the performances seem ridiculously over acted, (the performances that is, not the 'actors' that turned up for one day of shooting to take their clothes off, stage some unconvincing scenes and swim in filthy lake). The glorious special FX of, say, Tarantula (1955), spring to mind.<br /><br />And cheap cheap cheap. Sometimes the croc doesn't even look like a croc (the dummy they actually hired (sometimes its not C64 animation, but not much), but more so a big pile of crap floating on the water. It's a paradox, they actually use the finished film as a prop on the movie Schnieder would be less annoying if he wasn't grinning like a lunatic for half the film (though he can recognize which of the teens is dead from his sneaker (cause there's only 7 in town)), but McMurray is kinda funny, however not enough to stop me from writing a scathing review whilst I actually watch it to make it more fun.<br /><br />It lacks pretty much everything the first one has, in fact, it pretty much lacks everything any film has, which is unfortunate as I have nothing else new to watch tonight.<br /><br />**SPOILER** The dog survives.<br /><br />Maybe *I* should've faked *my* own death!
