Started off really gay, with shots of children playing and families having a good old time in the neighborhood. Then there's this crazy guy. Another family moment, the girls follow their dad outside. Crazy guy goes off on little girl for being on his property. Dad says don't talk that way to my girl. Crazy guy, in a rage, goes back into his house and returns with a rifle. Shoots the dad. Okay I liked this part. It was shot in a very matter-of-fact way and thus the movie's gayness started to subside. But not for long. It becomes a gay action movie, then a gay horror movie, with a classic, is he behind the curtain?.....Nope. Then it gets even more dragged out, lots of sob moments for the ones shot, then some gay music at the end to wrap it all up.<br /><br />So overall very gay, I was honestly hoping that after the gay beginning it would start to redeem itself, and it did... but then it came back with heaps of gay that just plain ruined it.
