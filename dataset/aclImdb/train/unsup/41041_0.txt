This your typical T&A grade B horror 80s cheesefest, but it has the distinction of starring no less than THREE B movie T&A queens: Linnea Quigley, Michelle Bauer (McClellan), and Brinke Stevens, who show their assets throughout the film.<br /><br />This film is long out of print and very tough to find, but worth the effort for fans of 80s B movie cheese.
