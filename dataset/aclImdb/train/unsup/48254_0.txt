This has to be one of the worst films ever made. Plenty of Spencer Tracy shouts of "Men..do this" and "Men... do that". You can understand why there's a load of "pull together for King (Vidor) and Country" patriotic gibberish cos it was made during the war. But it doesn't excuse it anymore than you could excuse John Wayne's cringe fest that was The Green Berets - made during the Vietnam war. In essence, gung ho nonsense that could only ever appeal to white American males running about the New Jersey countryside playing at toy soldiers.
