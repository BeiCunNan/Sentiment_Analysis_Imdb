After being attacked and raped by a gang of hoodlums, an aerobics instructor named Sandy turns to her new friend Sam, a karate expert, for help. After some martial arts training, she and her newfound karate cohorts decide to bring their own brand of justice to these hoodlums since the police won't do anything about them. It should also be noted with regards to the plot that never ever, not even for one single moment, does it become convincing in its portrayal of events.<br /><br />I swear I could feel my brain cells literally melting away as I watched this cheese fest that is when it wasn't being utterly overwhelmed by the almost vomiting inducing level of political correctness constantly a presence in this film. Indeed, the gang is made up of members from nearly every different race (must not discriminate after all when it comes to male sleaze balls) and all the guys in the film who seem to be actually able to fight seem to also be totally ineffectual as males for the most part, wearing pink t-shirts or sweatshirts, doing aerobics and basically anything our leading lady Sandy asks them to do. It's interesting that only the effeminate men seemed to be portrayed in a positive light. Possibly as a means to appease all those male sleazes watching at home, the camera does seem to continuously leer at women as they work out to the point you honestly expect this to turn into a full blown porno film at any moment (the music even lends itself to this suggestion). However it never does. In fact, it doesn't even have any nudity.
