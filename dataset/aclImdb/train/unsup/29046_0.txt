Cowboy Bebop rocks it. Especially the last episode. After seeing<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />Spike fall and the credits roll, not only was I sad that the good guys suffered, but that it was over. Believe me, by the first few episodes I was hooked. I've read all the books and god, this is anime at it's best. The soundtrack is also one of the best I've ever heard.
