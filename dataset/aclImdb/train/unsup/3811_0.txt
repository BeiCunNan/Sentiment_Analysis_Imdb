spring break shark attack proved to be the superior CBS spring movie. i was thoroughly disappointed by this movie. the release of the locusts was weak to say the least. however the acting wasn't horrible. i wish axlerod would've been the bad guy because that is an awesome name for a villain.<br /><br />the humor attempted in the movie was god awful. they could've made it more suspenseful and eventually sold it to sci-fi. there is no way this movie will ever be on the sci-fi channel. it is that bad. i don't think anyone is truly scared by locusts after watching that film. <br /><br />they needed to explore the office love affair more deeply. that might have saved it.
