This movie got it all... as long as you understand swedish! Translations might be good but you always loose the words that is unspoken. The Movie got a mainpart which is the crime scene, a sub-part that is the competition at work (who should have the power...), and a sub-part wich contains the daily problems in the family of the main caracter.<br /><br />As a crime movie it has a great story wich really shows how the work of the police and the newspapers really are run! No stupid fictionary roles...
