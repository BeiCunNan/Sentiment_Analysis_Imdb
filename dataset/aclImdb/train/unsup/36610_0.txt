What is the meaning of writing all of those imaginary events to ascribe them to the legendary singer's last stage ?, did they want to say how the artist's life is just a truth in illusionary frame ? Or that any artiest has only one timed opportunity to be creative and after its end there will be no more ingenuity ??!!, or that love can destroy an artiest utterly (her love story with Onassis) ?, or that any attempt to ruminate the lost youth is impossible (the relationship between the agent and the painter, Callas and the young actor) ? Is it about how sincere (Callas) was when she refused to complete the hoax and demanded to terminate the movie within the movie ? So being that sincere to reality why rather they didn't terminate (Callas Forever) itself already ??? Well.. The real question which buzzes in my head all the time and maybe I'll sleep better if I found its answer is WHY did they make this whole absurd movie in the first place ???, what kind of possible concept could be expressed through this story which never happened ?! I have no idea ! All what I'm having is just tons of confusion and even more tons of disgust not only because of me being that ignorant, but also because of me being that patient to stand all of this antipathetic movie till it ended !! I didn't hate it because it's not understandable...I hate it because it doesn't want to be understandable, and I've always thought that when you finish watching a movie then give it a lot of thinking to discover totally nothing about its own meaning or its special message, so this is the definition of a "Bad" movie ! long story short : I'm sorry to whom reads right now because you'll find nothing more than questions, and I'm sorry that you've watched it too as it's not Callas Forever it's Silliness Forever !
