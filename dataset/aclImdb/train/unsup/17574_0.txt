I am not a sports fan. I remember watching this film growing up. I remember the great Walter Mathau as the grumpy coach and Tatum O'Neal as the female pitcher. I enjoyed the relationship he had with the team especially Amanda. I also loved the theme music in the movie. The movie was well-regarded for many reasons particularly it's smart writing, great acting, and direction. I enjoy classic and this one is certainly a classic to be remembered. It's funny yet realistic and touching as the former major league player becomes the most unlikely coach of a losing baseball team. Mathau was perfect for this role. O'Neal shows how she won an Academy Award and the cast is well memorable as well. The film would come up with a series that didn't last as long because the magic just wasn't there.
