I admit it -- I am a sucker for a certain type of Steve Martin movie ("The Jerk," "L.A. Story," and of course "My Blue Heaven") -- the days when he was choosing to make stuff that was wonderful mix of funny and sweet. In this movie, Martin and Rick Moranis have a nice chemistry as a semi-reformed mob guy and the FBI agent assigned to protect him. There are some incredible one-liners, sight gags, and a great cast of character actors showing up as various old-time wise guys. As usual, Joan Cusack is terrific as the love interest who manages to make Moranis softer and more tough at the same time. It's also a movie that makes you sad that you don't see Melanie Mayron more. And the dancing scene on the beach -- completely charming.
