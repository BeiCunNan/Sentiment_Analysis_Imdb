I must say that I find refuge in foreign films. I tend to watch Korean, Japanese, Spanish, etc. movies because since they do not have the budget for big explosions and special effects, they spend time making movies that make you think, movies with soul, movies worth watching and remembering.<br /><br />Sadly, this Valley of the Wolves - Iraq could have been a chance for Turkey to make an excellent movie from their perspective. We do not have to agree that the United States of America is always going to be portrayed as the hero or the champion. We are a country like many others with people from all walks of life serving in the armed forces of our nation. With this, come intelligence, wisdom, stupidity and ignorance, and the complete range in between.<br /><br />Turkey decided to make a movie that would sell tickets, not portray the truth. We as a nation have committed many mistakes. We mistreated prisoners, we disrespected customs and traditions, and we could have made a heck of a lot better job that what we have done up until now.<br /><br />And the Turkish public has a right to the fantasy that is being sold by this movie. They have the right to be isolated from the EU, by not accepting the Armenian Genocide, and they have the right to not allow us use of their ports to invade a country that has most of the strategic oil that we need as a superpower to survive. They have the right to insert Turkish Special Forces and be confused with irregular forces from Iraq. They have the right to fight against the Kurdish Separatist Movement that is so prevalent in Northern Iraq.<br /><br />They have the right to make a pathetic movie that stirs emotions and does not portray the United States Military for what it really is. We do this in Hollywood all the time.<br /><br />So congratulations to Turkey, for making a crass, sensational movie. Hopefully in 20 to 50 years, they will join the real world and make movies that stir the heart, not the penis.<br /><br />Respectfully, a US Soldier who saw the reality in Iraq, and it is nothing like this sad pathetic movie.<br /><br />The Turkish
