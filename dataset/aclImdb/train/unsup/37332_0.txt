Except the horrible cast, the ridiculous script & the lousy dialogues:<br /><br />Did the author only read ONE scientistic book about climatic structure, tectonic plates, or just physics? <br /><br />Never saw a more ridiculous movie.<br /><br />Better to spend the money for renting to me. :-)<br /><br />Why is it not possible to vote zero?<br /><br />No movie in the last years would deserve it more!<br /><br />AND: Which drugs are necessary to write a script like these? Which people are financing this waste of time?<br /><br />Worst movie of the last years!
