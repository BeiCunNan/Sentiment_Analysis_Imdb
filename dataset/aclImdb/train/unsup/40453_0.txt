DICE RULES is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It isn't even a movie. I don't like Andrew Dice Clay as a comedian. He is not clever, funny, interesting, creative, or daring. He just picks on different groups of minorities. He obviously hates women. He doesn't seem to see them as anything other than servants and sex tools. Why is this considered funny? I think George Carlin and Lenny Bruce are funny as hell. Why doesn't Andrew Dice Clay work? Because he is exploitative, mean spirited, and doesn't understand why what he is saying is simply wrong. He seems to hate everybody but himself. The audience of his skits are scary as hell. They look like an army of criminals with their fists thrusting upward and chanting his name as if they had practiced to chant it in perfect succession beforehand. This is one of the depressing films I've ever seen and I definitely don't recommend this film to anybody. I don't even want to meet somebody who finds this to be funny, although I already have numerous times. DICE RULES is complete crap.<br /><br />Pros: <br /><br />-none <br /><br />Cons: <br /><br />-bad comedy <br /><br />-crude <br /><br />-rude <br /><br />-mean-spirited
