I don't know what Gena Gershon's problem is, but oh my god it royally annoyed me during every second of this terrible movie.<br /><br />I find that in general, up-and-coming rock group movies leave a bit to be desired: The tale of "The Commitments" (1991) rapid rise to glory may have been watchable, but was just not plausible. "Satisfaction" (1988) was neither, and was just superficial to the core. "That Thing You Do" (1996) tried so hard only to achieve saccharine, dorky, false-rock results. But I'm sorry, "Prey For Rock And Roll" absolutely takes last place. It just sucks.<br /><br />Gena Gershon portrays a girl on the "ragged edge" of rock and roll, caterwauling for over an hour and a half in this movie. Her band plays the most painful, self-important, hook-less, uninteresting music heard in any of the above movies. Her performance is incredibly over-dramatic and overwrought in every way. And despite the volume of her voice, she is not a vocalist. If I saw this band live I would leave. It was so bad that I don't think I can ever look at this woman (in any movie) the same way again.<br /><br />Perhaps, some say, it was her character's personal anguish that led her to such tortured artistry. But don't be fooled - it is only the viewer who is tortured. I say perhaps she should have taken to visual art or maybe pantomime instead. Anything to avoid witnessing a primadonna, non-rock trainwreck like this. Abysmal performances and music throughout make this a pure headache. Yuck.<br /><br />The good news for rock group movie lovers is that "The Buddy Holly Story" (1978) is excellent, and "Cotton Candy" (also 1978) is so bad that it's good. Seek these out instead, at any price.
