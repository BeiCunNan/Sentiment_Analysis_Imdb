I saw this movie in Bal√ßova, Izmir in a theater with a very bad sound and screen quality! So, i highly recommend you to watch this movie in a better theater! While watching the movie, i realized that 7 or 8 couples left the cinema because of its irritating violent scenes which reminded me Haneke's "Funny Games" but Barda is really bloody and realistic. As far as i know, this is one of the most hardest Turkish film with its hardcore torture scenes and vulgar, parental advisory language . So, that's the first reason for you to watch this movie. But, what disappoints me is its very poor final. Because it was completely unnecessary to give people "moral lessons or any misleading thoughts" by making the tortures killed in jail. If the director would have finalized the film without showing us the revenge, this could have been one of the "cult" movie ever made!!! When the torturers were killed in the jail (by zeki demirkubuz..etc), some people in the theater applauded as a reaction of convenience. That was because of moral catharsis that the director made his fatal error by finalizing the film like this. But it is still very promising and unforgettable movie that should be really seen by any cinema lovers! But, don't go with your sweetheart!!!!!
