This is one of the most underrated sitcoms ever. Ryan Reynolds is a comedy genius. It has Nathan "Cpt Mal Reynolds" Fillion in it. The story lines are interesting, like the characters, and the comedy is intelligent.<br /><br />The way Pete and Berg play off one another, and the relationship that they have is brilliant. My room mate and I have taped the series' off Trouble, and not a week goes by when we don't watch it.<br /><br />Every episode makes me laugh. Deserved at least a 5th season, but i guess thats how the idiot networks do things these days.<br /><br />I don't really need to plug it anymore, as it does that itself. Watch it, and you'll see what I mean.
