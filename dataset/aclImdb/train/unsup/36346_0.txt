After the Big Fat Greek wedding (that I liked), this was awful... got the feeling that the Greek tourist agency paid a lot to 'force' them to make this movie..... resulting in this uninspired 'movie'..... in fact I would not call this a real movie.... it's more a far too long commercial for Greece...... but it's worse than that because you get a strange impression of the country and I can't imagine that the Greek tourist agency had this intention... what a waste of time an energy....... I was expecting a feel-good movie of the BFG-Wedding caliber....... maybe that was the reason that this was disappointing.... after the BFGW which was simply very good this could only be worse
