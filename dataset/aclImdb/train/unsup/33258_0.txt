Jim Wynorski directed some extremely watchable B-movies in the beginning of his career. Deathstalker 2, Chopping Mall, Sorority House Massacre 2, to name a few. While all cheesy, they were all fun. This film, however, is not among his bests by a long shot. (it IS however writer R.J. Robertson's best, but compared to House 4, Munchie strikes back, or Beastmaster 2, that's not particularly a ringing endorsement) Dexter accompanies Marisa to Transylvania in order to get to her uncle's funeral and subsequent viewing of the video will. She stands to inherit the family mansion, but sinister Byron, her other uncle (played by Robert Vaughn, who must have needed money in a bad way). The jokes and so-called 'parodies' are lame, obvious, extremely unoriginal, and more likely to produce a groan than anything even remotely resembling a laugh. If you're a maschocist rent this along with the equally atrocious Transylvania 6-5000 for the completely laughing double feature from hell.<br /><br />My Grade: D-
