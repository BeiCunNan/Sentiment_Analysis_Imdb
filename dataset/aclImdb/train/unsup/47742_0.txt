OK i've seen worse, by school kids =D this is utter sh*t. one point for the sounds that somebody normalized, and used OK mics. otherwise this film is done on dvcam, with lots of hand-held shots that look like my mother was on her holiday doing a little tourist filming.<br /><br />at points the music sounds like shopping TV stuff... it's that bad really, and it's not even funny.<br /><br />i didn't watch the whole film for apparent reasons... and did a lot of fast forwarding. ha ha... i've done quite a bit of filming, and i can tell you that me, and my beer buddies could do the same easily. when that is true then the movie can't be great =D=D=D (not to dis myself, but to be honest) stay away from this crap.
