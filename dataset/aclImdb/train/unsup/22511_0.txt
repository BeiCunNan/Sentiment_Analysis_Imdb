crap...my fianc√© fell asleep.... bad acting, predictable, nothing to waste your time on. REALLY don't waste your time or $$$.Even the gore scenes aren't that gory. The main character is a wannabe Rachel Ray I guess and the end result just disgusts at the small attempt at a twist ending.LAME LAME LAME. This movie didn't even satisfy my B horror movie cravings and I can deal with even cheese with gore but they were actually serious when attempting to create a "HORROR" movie. The cover art doesn't even have ANYthig to do with the movie. NOthing to do with the movie and technically there is NO steel trap so inaccurate title also. TOO bad it may have had potential.
