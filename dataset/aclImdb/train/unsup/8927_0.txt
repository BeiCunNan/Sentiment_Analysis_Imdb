I saw this at Tribeca Film Festival and had a great time. This is a great example of low budget film-making at its best. The first half hour establishes the protagonists, which are all a nice mix of "real" New Yorkers who are under threat of eviction. This is due to the major gentrification of the city, which is slowly causing it to lose its soul. Film deftly conveys how NYC is becoming a city just for the wealthy. A rat plague begins turning people into zombies. The film drags a bit and then picks up steam in the final half hour. There's one shot in the front seat of a car involving the reunion of two characters and the elimination of another. It's one of the best scenes I've see in a horror film in quite sometime. Filmmakers should be commended for not selling out on the bleakness of this apocalyptic post 9/11 gem.
