Being a fan of Jude Law was essentially the incentive to go and watch this film. Before the film actually started i was unaware of the overt plot. Set in the outskirts and center of King's Cross, with modern architecture and two 'families' with contrasting backgrounds seem to intrigue me. Without detailing the film too much, the concept seem simple, and common. Yet it seemed to be so well crafted and intricately devised. Jude Law gave a very honest and truthful and convincing performance alongside Robin Wright Penn, the sleep deprived worn girlfriend. Penn gave a delicate yet fierce performance particularly at the end, when she lashes out at Will for all the preceding predicaments that he had caused. Juliette Binonche, a french actor with a wide range of persona skills depict the sense of solemness to a high degree. Her accent was very realistic and above all her presence was credible. <br /><br />Though this film has the intentions of establishing a dramatically intense atmosphere, the tension breaks with a touch of crude humour when the prostitute appears. Although strictly speaking this would normally be facetious, it works perfectly well. <br /><br />With the film's score weaved in the background, it creates a 5 star film. The actors give an almost impeccable performance, and will ensure a string of credits to their name.
