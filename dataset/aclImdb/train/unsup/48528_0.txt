look, i rented this because Jim from the office is in it and i love him. but this movie is awful and pointless. everything this stoner chick does makes things even worse and in the end there's no resolution. it starts with her screwing herself over and ends with her more screwed over. in fact i tried getting high half way through this to see if that would make it funnier. nope. not even then with the addition of grade a cannabis did this movie get enjoyable. i wish i could get my time and money back. anyone who says they really enjoyed this most be one hell of a hardcore stoner. even the box is deceptive. from what the back of the movie said it sounded like this sweet innocent blonde thing accidentally eats some pot cupcakes and shenanigans ensue. and in that case i thought it be interesting and funny to see a sweet girl trying to buy pot for the first time. and on a side note the drug dealers hair was ridiculous. but thats not the case, its just a stoner who gets high and then gets more high. one up side to this movie is the amount of awesome cameos. but even with all that star power the script was weak. the only joke that i found funny was when she said she had her masters in econ. but even then they don't explain why that didn't work out or why shes such a loser.
