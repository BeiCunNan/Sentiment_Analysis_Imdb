Lightweight romantic comedy, but Sir Ralph Richardson's last film and the only movie featuring BOTH Sir John Gielgud and Sir Ralph Richardson. Plus, Susan Brooks is adorable as the girl. I'm usually unaffected by romantic comedy, but I really enjoyed this film when I caught it late night many years ago on a cable channel. An American college student is invited to his rich English roommate's wedding and of course falls in love with the prospective bride. Cleverly written and well-acted. Amazingly, this movie doesn't appear in any of the film reference books, I've seen and it is doubtless not available on home video...
