I would rate this show a 9 if it wasn't for last season. The family edition three seasons ago and the one after that with the hippies were awesome. I loved every episode of those. <br /><br />But last season I stopped watching after the 4th or 5th episode. I don't remember seeing a show in which I didn't like a single contestant. They either had no personality or were too bitchy. TAR's aim for diversity produced some of the most ridiculous array of contestants that I've seen. We had an equal helping of Muslims, handicapped, Indians, homos, and ho's. I hope they have better characters next season.
