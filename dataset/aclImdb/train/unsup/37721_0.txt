The movie doesn't build up the main characters at all, They are just presented to you. No view into the main characters life at all.<br /><br />Your perspective from the beginning of the film is that the Paul character is your stereotypical movie 'bad guy'. His character lacks substance and meaning throughout the entire film.<br /><br />No insight into why the murders are taking place. No insight into his past, Nothing at all.<br /><br />He is so stereotypical that he snugs his chin into his chest before going in for the kill, A typical horror film clich√©. It used bleak lighting, typical music, and on top of that you have the AWFUL acting. <br /><br />Unfortunately the acting is so bad that it kills any originality that could have been.<br /><br />Maintenance completely lacks originality and substance even though the storyline could very well of worked out with a better cast of characters and better direction.
