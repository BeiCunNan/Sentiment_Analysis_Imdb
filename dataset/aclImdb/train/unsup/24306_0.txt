Seth Green and Matt Senreich have invented something absolutely hilarious! This old-school stop-frame animation is a welcome departure from normal animated comedies. Totally fresh and with sick twists included everywhere, 'Robot Chicken' raises the bar for other new comedies. Action figures find new life as players in this frenetic sketch-comedy and the results are hilarious. Celebrities are satirized and pulverized, stereotypes are taken further than ever before, and TV shows/Films play the central role in creating what I think is possibly one of the best shows around (along with 'Family Guy' and 'American Dad') If anyone has any other shows that are in the same vain, please tell me.
