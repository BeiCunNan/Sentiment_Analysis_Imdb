I bought The Cutter in a bargain bin at a place her called Rogers Video for 5$. Chuck has never been known for his acting ability,but I am a fan of his action movies,so I decided to give it a chance. 85% of the time, I was bored by the lack of action,there are barely any fights,the story isn't very interesting and even Chuck himself looked bored. You have two great legit Martial Artist's in Chuck Norris and Dainel Bernhardt,why not give the fans a special fight,instead of giving us the crap they did. I was just so disappointed in it all,how on earth could they screw that one up?. The story itself is routine and unimaginative,Diamonds??..We've seen this story too many times before and done better at that. Did Chuck need a decent paycheck that badly?..this sure looked like a paycheck film,I didn't see the point of this film being made what so ever. I really should stop watching all these DTV action films,but every once in a while you find a surprising gem in a batch,however The Cutler is definitely not one of them. If you wanna see some good Chuck films,perhaps you should go back to his glory days and start there.<br /><br />Performances. Chuck Norris looks asleep for the most part of the film. Why did he make this film,if he didn't care about it?. He looked so bored half the time,only showing up for a couple of fight scenes. The charisma is non existent,his dialog is awful..what happened Chuck?. Joanna Pacula is OK. She's pretty but not much else. Daniel Bernhardt is a well known martial artist, But he plays it much too over the top as the villain. He was wooden and his potentially classic showdown with Chuck is never delivered,what a shame.<br /><br />Bottom Line. The Cutter is yet,another terrible DTV Action film. No thrills,no excitement,boring dialog and amateurish acting. Not recommended unless you want to cure your insomnia.<br /><br />3/10
