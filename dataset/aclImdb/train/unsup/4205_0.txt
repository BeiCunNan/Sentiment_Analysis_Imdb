Having seen this movie again on TV, I realized how enjoyable it was - the casting of Errol Flynn and the gorgeous Olivia de Havilland is a major factor, for they both played their parts superbly. Action was non-stop, and the brawl scene is now remembered as one of the best in early movies. Westerns can be very boring, but not this one. The supporting cast was excellent, but I would have liked to see more made of the Ann Sheridan role - Victor Jory, of course, was a great villain, along with Bruce Cabot. Fiction of course, but a good story of the founding of a great western town.<br /><br />Some of the cameo roles as played by Alan Hale, Guinn Williams, John Litel, William Lundigan and Douglas Fowley added to the fun, and I thought Henry Travers small role was a gem. It proved though what a great combination Errol & Olivia were, and would prove to be many times.
