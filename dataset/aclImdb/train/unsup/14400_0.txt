Spoilers- Our story begins where Daffy Duck feels like he's been in the comedy game for too long and tries to convince a Hollywood exec that he can do a more serious performance, so he reads him a million page script that he wrote himself. In a parody of Emmurska Orczy's The Scarlett Pimpernel The Scarlett Pumpernickel( Daffy) is getting on the lord high chamber land( Porky Pig)'s nerves, but has captured the heart of the fair Melissa. The Lord High Chamberland gets this wicked idea to marry his daughter the fair Melissa to the Grand Duek( Sylvestor) just to lead the Scarlett Pumpnickel so they can obliterate him. So naturally Scarlett shows up, crashes the wedding and Melissa saves them both and they hid in a small structure. Whiel Scarlett goes a way for a while, leaving Melissa there in the open the Grand Duke arrives to refresh himself, only to find Melissa. Just before he sneaks his way laughing like a mad man Scarlett comes in and they sword fight to the death. The sad part is, Daffy can't seem to finish the story, except, well, I shouldn't reveal a thing. *Winks*<br /><br />This short is so beautifully random and of course, hilarious! <br /><br />See it now!
