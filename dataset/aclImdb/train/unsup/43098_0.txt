Poorly written, poorly plotted, poorly acted, poorly filmed. As a matter of fact, one of the few redeeming qualities was the quality of the body-double (though the transition from actress's face to the body-double was also poorly done). I felt like I was watching some sort of corporate training video: same overall quality...same overall message.
