Just saw this movie tonight at the European Movie Week. While I am not a movie freak like my darling wife, it is simply the best movie I have seen in perhaps 10 years! Come on! I can't believe I am actually online looking for how to buy this movie. I have NEVER been bothered before to even look at the cast in a movie, not to talk of looking a movie up online. With zero violence or nudity, I find the simple manner of presentation of the plot highly intellectual. I hope to get it on DVD and perhaps, distribute. It has definitely changed my perception of European movies. My son is musically talented and this movie has positively impacted on my thinking about raising him.
