I have given this movie a vote of 1. This is because I have voted using the same criteria for all of my other votes. This truly is a terrible film if somebody sits down and takes it seriously. However, the majority of people who watch this film watch it for its comic value. This is not a film that you laugh at because it contains good jokes or satire, this is a film that you laugh at! It is so cheaply made and the cheesiest thing ever! The highlight of the film is definitely when Hercules (Arnie) dukes it out with a "600 pound Grizzly bear". Hmmmmmm, well this grizzly bear must be a kick boxing one because i swear he puts up his guard ready to take on the mighty Hercules! Other highlights include the traffic noises and aeroplane noises in the heavenly land of Olympus! Oh and when a god that can fly chooses to ride in a helicopter, classic! I recommend that this film be watched if you fancy a right good laugh or you are seriously drunk!
