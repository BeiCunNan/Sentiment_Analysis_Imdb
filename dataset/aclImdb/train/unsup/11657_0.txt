I have seen a lot of TV, some bad, some good, but nothing compares to this TV series from DR (Danmarks Radio = danish state television).<br /><br />When Matador was shown the first time on TV, the streets of Denmark lay empty. Approximately 50-60% of the country's population was inside watching the fascinating history of the imaginary town "Korsbaek" and its inhabitants unfold and evolve.<br /><br />The DVD box set has been purchased by over 1.000.000 people in Denmark (which only has a population of approx. 5.200.000)!!!<br /><br />Now nearly 30 years later, I have not seen any TV series that can top this one. It has been sold to approx. 20 countries and is currently repeated on DR for the fourth or fifth time.<br /><br />This is as good as it gets!
