I was surprised actually. Eddie Murphy always seems to create those "family fun-way-to-cliché" type movies. And yet-I liked this one. And yes- it was cliché, but it was cute and funny. The little girl was quite the little actress as well! The soundtrack was also all Beatles so what's not to like? Though I do not like the updated versions they chose, it added a lot to the flick. The'bad guy' or I suppose antagonist is an overly stereotyped Native American, but come on people-don't be so defensive. Besides, we find out later that he is a very small percent of Indian and is, in fact, just a jerk. It had moral value and sweet moments. Worth a rental I'd say.
