Chris O'Donnell plays a young handsome man who is (sigh) afraid of getting married. But he's been dating Renee Zellweger for three years and she wants to get married. He tries to propose but fails. Then his obnoxious grandfather dies and leaves him 100 million dollars...IF he gets married before his 30th birthday. But his 30th birthday is one day away, Zellweger has left town and he frantically races around town asking all the women he's dated in the past to marry him.<br /><br />O'Donnell doing comedy was a BAD mistake. For starters he can't act. Also this guy is handsome but he's so bland it's annoying. Doing a remake of Buster Keaton's hilarious classic "Seven Chances" was another stupid mistake. The script is unfunny and full of lines that are just groaners. Old pros Hal Holbrook, Edward Asner and James Cromwell are in this and manage to get a few chuckles despite their lines. The view of women is this film (especially at the end) is deplorable and there's a HUGE amount of swearing for a PG-13 film. Still it DOES have its good points (that's why I'm giving it a 4). O'Donnell's first proposal to Zellweger (and her reaction) is very funny. There's a good cast (save O'Donnell) and Zellweger is just great. There's also a cool soundtrack. Also Brooke Shields (almost unrecognizable) is hysterical in a segment towards the end. But, all in all, this was a REAL unwise career choice for O'Donnell. This movie bombed badly and got O'Donnell some of the worst reviews of his career. Hopefully this will steer him clear of ever trying comedy again. I give this a 4.
