This film manages to tell the story of European imperialism among Native Americans without glorifying or demonizing any of its subjects or characters. There are no clear cut good guys or bad guys and the only real demon here is misguided faith. The genius of this movie is that it makes it easy for us to view the story from both the Native American and the French Jesuit point of view. The lack of Hollywood stereotypes and minimalist dialogue help make the characters seem more real, making the climax subtle, yet surprisingly powerful. The incredible landscape and the excellent score only add to the proceedings. If you are looking to gain a better understanding about one of the more tragic and overlooked chapters in American history, skip Dances With Wolves and go with Black Robe instead.
