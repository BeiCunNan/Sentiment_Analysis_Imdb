It was refreshing to see a funny movie for the 40+ crowd. If profuse profanity and graphic sex conversations bother you, don't see this movie. No doubt some of the scenes are over the top. Mother's vulgar language was way out of line. In fact, it should have been cut and laid out on the editor's floor. But the midlife relationship crisis', I thought, were pretty accurate for the most part. Things look and are so different in ones mind when you reach 50 yrs on God's green earth. But I want a comedy to be first, funny in a real life way, which this is, and secondly entertaining, which this definitely was. After all was said and done, I came away from this movie feeling good and that's what its all about.
