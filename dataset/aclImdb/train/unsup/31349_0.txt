NCIS is a skillful balance of humor and serious drama. None of the major characters is static, i.e. there is depth. Every week, we discover more about the characters, who they are, where they are coming from, why they do what they do. But the show does not sacrifice the plot for the sake of the characters. Stories are well thought-out and believable. The cast is superb, with Mark Harman leading the ensemble. What a complex character, that Leroy Jethro Gibbs! At first, I did not like Tony; I thought he was an ego-centric, male chauvinist pig, but there's more in there than the id-controlled Mr. DiNozzo, I'm discovering. Then there's Abby--I just adore Abby! The mix of scientist, alternative lifestyle, street smarts and just a touch of naivet√©. Tim McGee started out like a puppy, willing to please. Well, that puppy's growing up, folks, and watch out! The two new characters, Ziva & Jenn are intriguing as well. I love the sexual tension between the director and Gibbs. And Ziva is more than a match for Tony. The vulnerability we saw in Hiatus was great, too. And Ducky: I save him for last for many reasons. A David McCallum fan for more years than I care to numerate, I can easily say that this is probably his best role (Colditz was his second best--check it out if you can).<br /><br />All in all, I look forward to the 4th season to show the same excellence of craft as the last three have accomplished.
