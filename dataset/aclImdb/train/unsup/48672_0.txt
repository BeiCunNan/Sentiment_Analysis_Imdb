Ok. I do respect movies. At least I always do what I can to see films also from other point of views.<br /><br />BUT.<br /><br />This is not a movie. It's really a piece of crap. Actually I myself have made better films than this one. I guess the point in this was to make a funny film, but actually nobody in the film crew or actors were interested about it.<br /><br />I got the feeling that the camera men (if there even were any) were asleep behind the camera. Directing is something .. yes and music and graphics too. Actors couldn't care less about anything. Leslie Nielsen is infact the only guy even trying to do something of it, but I guess he stopped trying at some point.<br /><br />Wait.<br /><br />I remember some laughters.. Yes, when the keycode of a door made some familiar beeps and the other one was when Nielsen was evasing asteroids or something. But that's it. The rest wasn't even entertaining.<br /><br />So everybody should cut the crap about "This is the worst movie I've ever seen". They actually haven't seen any movies if they say something like that about modern movies. To them I'll have to say: see this.<br /><br />Actually the funniest thing was that the cover said that this film was released in 1994 and also that: After "Naked Guns" and "Spy Hard" Leslie Nielsen takes you to the funniest space trip you have ever experienced.<br /><br />Geez. Do these guys ever watch what's in there...
