I didn't think so, LOL!!! Are you kidding me? Combat Shock is hands down, the most depressing movie I have ever seen, yet laughing just kind of came natural, but I would imagine you would need a rather dark sense of humor to see any humor in this at all, but believe me, it is totally there, it's just that it's overshadowed by the morbid, nightmarish, grittiness of it all. Never has the portrayal of the effects of war and poverty come off so devastatingly hopeless. Not only dealing with memories of war and other atrocities, but having to live in filthy Staten Island, having to support a freakish infant who will apparently never get strong enough to grow or even age and a wife with a nagging voice and repulsive physical appearance, not to mention bills, along with debts to a guy who wants to kill you, no food, no work and zero money, never mind the fact that your'e "this close" to going insane. To me, Combat shock is funny in a Blood Sucking Freaks kind of way, just a little more subtle, or maybe it's the soundtrack that makes you feel like you're watching something humorous, almost like the cheap-sounding repetitive theme song is taunting the shell-shocked Vietnam vet as he walks up and down Staten Island looking for something... anything positive.<br /><br />Just to break it down, Combat Shock makes Taxi Driver look like Mr. Deeds. Troma really struck gold with this one. Recommended to anyone looking for a depressing nightmare of a swell time. If you're looking for something more upbeat and redeeming, try out Eddie Murphy's next project. I'm sure it'll be cute. Even though I feel they could have taken the shock value just a tad further. I give Combat Shock 9 stars, for possibly being one of the top 5 most powerful films of all time.
