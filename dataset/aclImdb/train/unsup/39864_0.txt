Oh you`re calling me a liar and saying I`ve just made up the plot for this film . No , I`m not , that`s the plot of TIME SERVED .

Do you like bloody stupid films with lots of plot holes ? Do you like to see once respected actors like Bo Hopkins and Louise Fletcher make fools of themselves ? Do you like cliches ? Then you will love TIME SERVED <br /><br />I hated this movie
