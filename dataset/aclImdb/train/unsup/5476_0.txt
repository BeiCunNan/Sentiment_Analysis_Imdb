Hello dude, salute from the Glorious Germen's cine club. This movie is like a dream come true, or a nightmare come true, its phenomenal and very very very espa√±olada. You can see in this master piece the vision of Alex about de Armageddon (a very bad movie, don't see it), this vision its a latin vision, whit no heros, no muscle guy beating Satan, no, this movie it's about a priest who discover the day and the place where the evil will come, and whit the help of a fat heavy metal and a false exorciser tv showman KILL A BABY, a baby named Satan. This movie have a very goods gags, like the priest killing her friend family by error, and others. This movie it's excellent. Good bye and good killing.
