Many people say they love someone. That they love their family, their children, anything. But true love for a family can be seen in the sacrifices that Gracie, a teenage girl, shows for her family. With an unreliable mother, and ailing grandmother, the burden of her family is left squarely on her shoulders, and we see the lengths and sacrifices she has to give up to keep her family together. Kristen Bell's performance is heart breaking and one that will keep you hooked, especially in scenes featuring Anne Heche, another fantastic performer. The little boys in this movie will break your heart as you can see the struggles in their eyes when they are torn between being loyal to the mother that gave birth to them, and the mother they have always known. One to watch, without a doubt.
