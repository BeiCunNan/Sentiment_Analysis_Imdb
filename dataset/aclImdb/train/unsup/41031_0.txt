If you have seen this movie, you'll notice the side of the high school that was used as the front of the high school for the movie shots. That was the entrance used by the student parking lot. Well, that no longer exists as the high school has greatly expanded.<br /><br />I always wonder why they didn't use the front of the school (could have covered up the school name) because the view from across the street would have been nice.<br /><br />Rancocas Valley is a beautiful school and this movie reminds me of how it used to be (class of '96)<br /><br />If you are a Mount Holly native or graduated from RV, check out this movie.
