Repeat viewings of "Buck Privates" deliver a warm nostalgia for a time gone by when things were simpler and patriotism was a cherished ideal. After a supporting role in their first movie "One Night in the Tropics", Abbott and Costello scored in a big way in this 1941 film, and Universal Studios had a comedy machine on their hands. The boys jump right into their comic bits including a crap game, a money change routine and a military rifle drill, all with flawless comic timing. <br /><br />And there's a lot going on around them as well. There's a love triangle involving socialite Randy Parker (Lee Bowman), his ex-chauffeur Bob Martin (Alan Curtis) and Judy Gray (Jane Frazee). Nat Pendleton serves as comic foil, first as a cop on the beat and later as the hapless sergeant who can't control Costello's antics. Shemp Howard is also on hand in a comic mess scene. But the real entertainment is provided by the joyous Andrews Sisters, showcasing an array of popular tunes including "You're a Lucky Fellow Mr. Smith", "I'll Be With You in Apple Blossom Time", and their signature song - "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy".<br /><br />The "Buck Privates" theme worked so well that Abbott and Costello eventually found their way into other branches of the military, their next film was "In the Navy", followed by "Keep 'Em Flying" and "Buck Privates Come Home" a few years later. <br /><br />Jane Frazee proved to be a versatile entertainer, doing a song of her own in this film - "Gee But I Wish You Were Here". She made movies in a number of different genres including Westerns, along with five Roy Rogers titles in the late 1940's.<br /><br />"Buck Privates" is a great starting point whether you're just getting familiar with Abbott and Costello, or a long time fan wishing to relive their memory. If your tastes go for the classic Universal horror characters, their best offering is "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein". Whatever the venue, the boys always entertain, and remain one of the best and most successful comedy teams of all time.
