Except for Kim Basinger's performance in this movie there is little to recommend it. The story is biographical but it is somewhat pointless and goes no where as well as being disjointed. The time period is never clear but a lot happens in Kenya during this period and somehow the story never relates to it.<br /><br /> I have never considered Kim Basinger to be an actress, just a sex kitten, but she did show some acting ability in this flick. The tragedy of this movie is that she needlessly appears half nude from a less than revealing angle and it really detracts from the any value the picture had.<br /><br />But this is a story that should have been left untold. It is a waste of time.
