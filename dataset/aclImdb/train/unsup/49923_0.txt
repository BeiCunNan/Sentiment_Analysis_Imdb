I love watching a James Bond. It's not very intellectual, granted, but it's fun. I know the basic difference between each James Bond are the bad guy, the girl and the bad guy's HQ which always blows up at the end(don't tell me this is a spoiler). But in this, the producers had a new idea for James Bond: he will be on a personal vendetta... The idea was bad and so is the final product. Timothy Dalton is terrible. He was okay in "The Living Daylights" but this time, he is just awful. Everything about his Bond is wrong. He tries to be like Sean Connery, but never comes close to the Great One. I will add that the bad guy is just a crazy maniac that kills everyone in "original" ways. Bad, bad, bad... In fact, it is the worse James Bond, for now.<br /><br />If you want to see a James Bond today, don't watch this one. 4/10...
