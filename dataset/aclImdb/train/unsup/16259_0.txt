This episode was simply exhilarating. It has been a long time since we last had some insight into John Locke's character. We finally learn how he ended up in that wheelchair and we figure out that he and Ben have many connections and similar feelings about the island. In addition, the ending is amazing and it foreshadows more interesting things to come. Also, in this episode, we witness Locke in a mood which we have never seen before. He is frustrated and has a goal to reach. He also feels very frustrated that Ben can guess his thoughts. This improves this episode's plot. I highly recommend any one who has not yet watched this episode to watch it.
