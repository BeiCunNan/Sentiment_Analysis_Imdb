OK. To begin with, I just watched all of Buffy recently. I never watched it on TV because when the Buffy movie came out, I hated it (of course, a lot has changed since then). That being said, I gotta admit that I was very stunned to find out how enjoyable it actually was. I even began to get Willow-y when I talked at times haha. Season 7 was much darker than all the others, but I liked the way it was going, especially in the final few leading up to the finale. You can tell that the writers had practically given up by this episode or run out of ideas or something. The weren't giving nearly as much as they had for all of the others. I had a lot of problems with this episode, but one thing I did like was the Spike and Buffy scene (even though I never wanted them together, esp after he turned stalker-y and built a mannequin and a sex-bot, sniffing her undies...etc) I didn't understand why the spell had to turn all potentials worldwide into all out slayers when the major battle was in the school. Which also brings up another question... Why did the spell have to be performed at the school? Why not have done it at home instead of putting Willow and her girl in danger? I didn't think about it til today, but someone brought up another good point on this message board... Buffy was nearly killed by the uber-vamp two or three times... and she's got 8 years or so experience on the "new slayers", but they were killing the slayers with no problem. I was also rooting for her sis to be a potential which could've led to a very different ending, probably even better, a lot better. Its not that we are criticizing the show for it being the finale. All of the other endings were far better (even the one with the dream sequence). 5 was the best ending when they planned to end it the first time. What happened?
