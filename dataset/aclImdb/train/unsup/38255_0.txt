I have only seen the 7 minute version, so I may be missing out on a lot. Anyway, here is the rundown of events in "Rabbit's Moon". Somebody dressed in a clown suit is standing outside looking at the moon. A rabbit appears. Then a court jester appears and does a mime routine. Finally, a woman appears and does a terrible dance. The End.<br /><br /> Maybe I am just too stupid to understand the artistic integrity of this short. All I know is that it is boring and, in my humble opinion, a waste of celluloid and talent.
