Who gave the information of this biography? this looked to be very doubtful, and the Cubans may easily argue that this is what they simply call a 'folleton'. The Artemisa man Sandoval is a person that, within the time living in a Cuban system, understood that it was not good for his future and life of his family, but to put him as a 'contra' when he was a young man is doubtful. I saw the first half of the film then gave up because this looked to me DOUBTFUL. If you read the book of another Cuban musician Paquito D' Rivera, 'Mi vida Saxual', you will note that Sandoval was friendly with Paquito but not to share the same political ideas during the 70s as it is shown in the film. It is also a non sense to show the people from the Ministry of Culture in Cuba not knowing the musician Chano Pozo at all, and letting Arturo take away Gillespie (without official authorization)in his 'car' once he arrived in Cuba. The only part, which looked to me real was the the talk between Arturo and the American officer at the USA Embassy in London when Arturo wanted to leave Cuba because the officer raised the right questions.
