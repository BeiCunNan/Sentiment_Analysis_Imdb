Poor Danielle (Cerina Vincent). While she waits to return to the house on Haunted Hill, she is stuck in a ranger tower in the woods of British Columbia. Maybe she can pass the time with that weed they are famous for up there.<br /><br />But no, she takes solace in a bottle of vodka and agonizes about driving drunk and killing her friend. In the meantime, there is an alien-like creature stalking the wood killing people.<br /><br />We get lots of screaming and heavy breathing from Danielle while the creature attacks her. But It never kills her as it does every other person. Why? Who knows? The best aspect of this film is the scenery. I have to admit that it was absolutely beautiful. But, I wanted a horror movie, not a nature film.
