For the third Crow outing, I was left feeling rather skeptical of watching this considering the disaster with City of Angels? <br /><br />I actually purchased this film on DVD in May last year and regrettably passed on to a friend considering I wasn't going to watch this too often as much as the original. <br /><br />This time around it seems to have learnt from the mistakes from the 2nd part by sticking very closely with the themes of the original.<br /><br />Eric Mabius was a surprise indeed for the lead with Kirstin Dunst on hand in a supporting role. Parts of the film did lack in places but was still exceptional viewing nevertheless. <br /><br />I wasn't too sure about the villainy, as I thought the police being behind the murderous cover-up of Alex Corvis's (Eric Mabius) girlfriend (played by Jodie-Lynn O'Keefe) was little cheesy not mention repetitive with the idea of the police being the bad guys.<br /><br />Visually it does resemble the original a lot and thumbs up Eric Mabius as well as he does pay homage to Brandon Lee very well.<br /><br />I thought Fed Ward wasn't as menacing as he appeared to be, but was decent attempt.<br /><br />Not bad, but please tell Miramax/Dimension to stop panning out any further Crow sequels as they really should have learnt their lesson with the last outing.
