I watched this when they first showed the series on TV. At the time I was studying Jane Eyre for O Level English literature exam.<br /><br />This became a favourite book of mine for all time and I have read it many times since.<br /><br />I loved this series. The characters were just as I imagine and they followed the original text very closely. Knowing it well, I was able to quote sections along with the actors.<br /><br />I always remember enjoying this production and would love to own it on Video or DVD. I have not enjoyed another production of Jane Eyre as much as this.
