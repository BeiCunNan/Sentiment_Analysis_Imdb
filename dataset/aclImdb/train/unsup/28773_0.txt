<br /><br />The only good thing that I can think to say about this movie is at least it wasn't worse than 28 Days Later. Boy was that torture or what?! That being said, there now only remains an onslaught of negative opinion.<br /><br />This movie reeks of an amateurism that only a group of silly teens would take interest in. It has your bizarre, ditsy, nude-babe material that's a must for any sleep-over (yawn). I mostly felt sorry for the film because you can see how hard the director is trying to make a good movie, but just misses the boat completely. This seems to be so prevalent nowadays that I have come up with a theory about it. <br /><br />The target market for all new horror films is mindless teenagers. This is the audience the movie has been created for and the one that it is designed to attract. For an old man like me, we are out of the picture. Not even considered. Because why in the world would they want to go through the trouble of making a REAL horror film? One that involves great skill, attention to detail, and solid construction. Who wants to go through all that trouble? Nah, making a cheap and quick infantile flick and marketing it to a simple audience is much easier. That way old men like me are stuck continuing to gripe about how there aren't any serious horror films anymore. <br /><br />Where have all the cowgirls gone (sigh)?
