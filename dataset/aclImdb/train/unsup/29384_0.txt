I don't believe it! 5.3 is score for this movie? In my opinion this is one of the best movies in which Costner acted. OK,it's not some masterpiece,but it is far,far away from being a bad movie. <br /><br />I admit, I never liked Whitney too much and I would really loved if they picked another singer to act here, but directing, acting and everything in this movie was great. Here on IMDb I've seen some overrated movies,and in the other hand I've seen a lot of underrated movies - but after something like this I'm not sure I will pay to much attention on reviews on IMDb in the future. Yes,very often I really asked myself: Why Whitney?....but OK, her acting was pretty good and that's enough for me.<br /><br />So don't look at this hilarious 5.3 rating,and if you haven't already, go and watch this movie because it really deserves your attention. In my opinion this is the movie for 8.5/10 grade,but after this incredibly stupid 5.3 I'll give it 10!
