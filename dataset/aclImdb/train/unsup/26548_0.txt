Douglas Fairbanks was a peerless action star and in 1924 was at the top of his form. Raoul Walsh was one of our greatest action directors and paces THIEF very nicely. The special effects are mostly quite impressive, only a couple of them are so dated as to appear a bit silly. The art direction of Cedric Gibbons is astounding. The sets are either gorgeous or bizarre, and often both. The 20's was the golden age of pop culture in America and this film is one of the proofs.
