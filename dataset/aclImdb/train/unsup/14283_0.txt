Well I like it more than most it would seem, it's central theme of hypnosis as a weapon is a very good one and it plays out as an interesting story right up to the finale. Gene Tierney doesn't have to do much here, she is asked to portray confusion and delivers well enough, whilst Jos√© Ferrer is more than adequate for the dastardly role of David Korvo. I see a simple and effective noirish drama that although the ending is never really in doubt, the film has enough mystery about it to keep the viewer hanging in there for the final reel. The final scene may be a tad too contrived for some but it pays off well enough and as the credits rolled I was more than satisfied with what I had just watched.<br /><br />A very solid 7/10.
