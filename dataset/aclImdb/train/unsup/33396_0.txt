This being director David Keith's first directorial effort I was willing to be a little forgiving in it's production. After viewing the film I now understand while he has gone on to only direct one other movie, he's not very good. Even so, The Curse needs a lot of fixing up in both direction and editing just to get to mediocrity. The biggest problem is the flow of the movie, its feel is very rough as it jumps from scene to scene. This could be fixed with establishing shots.<br /><br />For example when Wil Wheaton's character views the Orb on the second night. We have a shot of Wil looking out his window, cut to a shot of the Orb outside, cut to a shot of Wil outside, looking at the Orb. How did he get there so fast?? A way to fix this is to have Wil looking at the Orb, get up to leave the room (to establish that he's going to go look at the Orb) and then cut to the scene of the orb, then cut to him looking at it. Doing little things like establishing shots can make a movie look a lot more professional.<br /><br />But as I said even if this was done the film would only be mediocre. Claude Akins and Wil Wheaton do as much as they can with the script they are giving. In my opinion only Cooper Huckabee performs above expectations and Kathleen Jordan Gregory gives a fine, if a bit over the top, performance as the mother, the first person to be infected. The rest of the cast ham it up way too much. This was probably done so people wouldn't take the film to seriously and therefore they wouldn't notice how bad it was, but they end up just being distracting. John Schnieder is in the movie for his name only, he has very little screen time and isn't very integral to the plot.<br /><br />The movie does have a couple of good moments, mostly dealing with the mother as she slowly turns into a hideous creature. But they are too few and far between to alleviate the boredom that sets in beforehand.<br /><br />It is also obvious that the movie ran out of money before it could be completed (or I hope it did) as the ending doesn't tie in very well with the prologue. Granted it doesn't have a "Hollywood type" ending and I give it credit for that but it needed to be done much better.<br /><br />Overall The Curse is a pretty dull movie and rates a mere 2 out of 10.
