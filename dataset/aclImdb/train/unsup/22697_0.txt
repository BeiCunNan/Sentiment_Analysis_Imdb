Up and coming star Sonny Westwood (Silvio Pollio who wrote, directed and everything else) is convinced by a producer that the only way to get ahead in the business is to kill the producers partners. He does it and films the attacks as his next movie. Its a comedy folks, a really bad comedy where the audience laughs at the ineptitude. Looking good, but the pits on every other level, this is full of falling stars (tome Sizemore,Gary Busey,Joe Estevez,James Russo, Roddy Piper) working for a paycheck. Its one of the worst films of the year hands down and destined to become something bad movie lovers watch and everyone else flees. Lets hope Pollio shuts up after this and never shoots another movie.<br /><br />2 out of 10 for the unintentional laughs
