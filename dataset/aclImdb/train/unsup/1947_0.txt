I haven't seen Jaws 3 in about seven years. Its one of those movies whether sequel or original film dates very quickly. the last time i saw the movie i noticed how bad the print looked (mind you it was a twenty year old VHS copy i viewed) and how i could not care less for what happened to any of the characters.<br /><br />The Great White Shark when it finally appears (this time its around thirty feet long) is laugh out loud fake and cheap. <br /><br />Chunks of rubber is a better description for the whole movie.<br /><br />Awful.<br /><br />Bloody Awful.
