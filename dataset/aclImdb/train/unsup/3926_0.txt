Nowhere is a great movie about drugs, the party scene, and a group of people, who I might want to add are in *COLLEGE*, not high school. Come on now people, some of the characters portray high school characteristics in their personalities but they are obviously more intelligent than that. It's too bad a movie like this doesn't get higher ratings or more reviews. This movie was well put together, and I was surprised to see so many big names in it compared to the Doom Generation. I think Greg Araki is very talented and has a complex mind in film.. and as you can see by the contents of this film, many other things. It's too bad Dark had to be so f****d in this movie, his girlfriend could have been a little more understanding too his needs :) Anyways, I've seen this movie well over twenty times and I could ramble on about it. Either way I voted this movie a 10, my vote would have been higher if I could vote higher. Thank you for your time :)
