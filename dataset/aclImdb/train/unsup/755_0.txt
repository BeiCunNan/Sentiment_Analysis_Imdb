I`m in two minds about THE EMERALD FOREST . Part of me admires it for its hard edged eco message coupled with its violent action packed adventure elements while part of me hates it for its convienent mystical mumbo jumbo when the script requires Tomme and the invisible people to escape from a tight spot . Is it an action adventure or is it a mystical fantasy ? It`s both and it`s neither if you know what I mean .<br /><br />Hold on , it`s an admirable film despite the flaws , in many ways THE EMARALD FOREST is the type of film Steven Seagal would have made if he had any talent , it`s a film that doesn`t talk down to the audience unlike nearly every eco-thriller made and does make the point that when everyone you love and everything you survey is in mortal peril then violence is the only way you can defend yourself . Compare this to the pacifist stance of the modern environmental movement and I think you`ll find it`s not a film that`d be too popular with Greenpeace
