It could be a nice film, but it was too predictable. The script was shouting it was made for TV. It might be a true story, but at some points it seemed too much that a lot of events were put together just for the dramatical effect of them, and it came out too unrealistic. It was a good thing watching Anna Chlumsky in a more mature role, but I thought that role was tailor-made exactly for that purpose. It was also a surprize seeing the final guest star, playing himself, and in fact a reason for searching IMDb for this movie!
