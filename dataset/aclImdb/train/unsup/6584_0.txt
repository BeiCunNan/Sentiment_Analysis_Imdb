The best movie I have seen in a long time, Deadbolt succeeds with an interesting plot, it's cleverness and the great performance of Adam Baldwin as the killer room-mate. Baldwin pulls off a performance which lets you take this stranger into your heart and your mind...bad mistake! You realize this as the story flows and gasp as you see the ease with which your life can be ended without dying. Some may say it's a rip-off of such films as Single White Female and Misery, while it is true it takes inspiration from these films, it really does stand on it's own two feet and if I may say...knocks the socks off Single White Female. This movie is ONE TO WATCH so as the tagline says... MAKE UP THE GUESTROOM, YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE HAS ARRIVED!
