Well, for 99p I could have made a better film than this. Cut a square out of the side of a cardboard box, place a small child inside the box, sit back and watch for an hour and a half. There will be more drama, excitement, satisfaction and better acting watching that child in the box than ever watching "Champion Killer." I saw it in the 99p shop once when I was looking for wrapping paper and on a whim I purchased it. Nothing could prepare you for such a dull experience. Made on what looks like the worst/cheapest camera available in the shop, with actors the director seemingly chose because they live next door/didn't demand payment, "Champion Killer" fails to deliver on any meaningful level. It's difficult just to recall how bleak an experience this was. I could waffle on about plot, setting, cast, camera work, lighting, sound and a whole host of other production values but there really is no point. They were all lost on this "film."
