I won't get into the computer game style of the movie, maybe its different, maybe its just a cheap excuse for bad 3d graphics and lack of budget for Effects. I sure watched this movie too late at night and since the pacing is slooooow (and thats still a compliment) it got hard to focus on the plot. Basically St Johns Wort is about some kids designing computer games. 2 of them delve into the story for a new one which is based on a house the graphics girl inherited. So the girl and a guy go there and move through the old abandoned house unfolding the "shocking" history of her father who was also a painter. All that done in a mixture of computer game dialog, finding keys for hidden rooms and Blair Witch Handycam storytelling.<br /><br />I think up to today i have never seen a movie that tried on the computer game-story and succeeded. Most are just ridiculous and except for the nice coloring St Johns Wort fails too. At first you get an eerie surveillance cam atmosphere which reminded me of "my little eye" but they just take it too far. I might have missed one or two details but i doubt that saves the movie. If you are out for a plot twist or something making the 90 minutes worth being spent... forget it, the finale is just plain idiotic. So altogether a waste of some nice visual ideas on a pretty stupid script.
