Forget Jackie Chan,Jet Li,Steven Seagal and Van Damme.The star of this movie,Gary Daniels is the best martial artist working in movies today.This London born action star always gives 110% in his fight scenes and is constantly improving as an actor as CITY OF FEAR shows.This tightly plotted little movie is no masterpiece and its lack of a decent budget is evident from time to time but nevertheless is a worthy entry in Gary's impressive filmography. Set in Sofia,Bulgaria the action in this movie takes place in fresh locations and is enjoyable for every one of its 90 minutes;the supporting cast is nothing to write home about but you won't be watching them,you'll be watching Gary Daniels and if you consider yourself an afficionado of martial arts movies and don't recognise his name I suggest you hot foot it to your local video store and put matters right straight away.Soon you'll be saying:"Jackie Chan? Who he?"
