(2/10). Let me start by saying that I had low, I mean really low expectations on this movie and it was worse. With the expectations I had I didn't of course pay to see this crap. Now I wouldn't see it ever again unless I got payed at least 10$, maybe even more. A real stinker and why not 1/10, because I've actually seen worse, can you believe it!
