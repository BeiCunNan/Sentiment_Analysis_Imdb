Yes, this remake is funnier than the original, but hasn't anybody noticed how the producer's decision to change the personality of certain characters actually changes the whole story??? In the original version, Betty is an incredibly smart girl, and gets really nervous around people, obviously because her father kept her from socializing..ever. But over all those nerves, you could see her intelligence, there was no doubt about that. But this version just changed the whole thing. Angelica Vale makes the character sound childish, instead of nervous. That goofy laugh doesn't help. Betty's laugh made her seem geeky, which was the whole point, but Letty's laugh makes her seem stupid. Honestly, seeing Lety act so ignorant makes it impossible to see her as a smart girl. I love Angelica Vale, by the way, and I blame the producers and directors for this one. Same thing with Lety's mom...the original version made it clear that Betty acted like her father and got her features from his side of the family including her laugh, and Julia, her mom was the normal one, which, believe it or not, helped the story a lot, but making Julieta, Lety's mom, the goofy one in this version just doesn't make it. The story is funny, but I just don't buy it. By the way, adding kids to the story-bad idea.
