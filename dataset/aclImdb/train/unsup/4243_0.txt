This first screenplay by Robert Desiderio is very commendable,<br /><br />He is from TV & so are all of the other actors.<br /><br />Judith Light & Stephen Lang are devout Christians, They run Genesis House, a home to help homosexuals be saved by the love of Jesus. A few years back her own son killed himself because he was gay, & this one of the reasons they run Genesis House, We are concerned with 2 of the guys. Robert Gant (he was Ben in Queer as Folk) & Chad Allen (many TV shows) Judith Light & Stephen Lang are TV Veterans of many years,<br /><br />Miss Lights role is not that of a bigot,it is one of a devout Christian misguided but definitely not a true bigot.<br /><br />This excellent performance & the roles done by Allen & Gant, make this a love story to be seen & discussed.<br /><br />It does have many clich√©s as one would expect, they are well handled<br /><br />This is another film made in New Mexico & the scenery is superb.<br /><br />It had a few month run in only a handful of theatres this fall.It should of had a better run.<br /><br />There is only one very short sex scene at the beginning & a few uses of the 'F' word.<br /><br />I recommend SAVE MR for lovers of good love stories.<br /><br />I am glad I saw this film.<br /><br />Ratings *** (out of 4) 87points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
