This is an awesome TV movie. It contained the return of Brian Austin Green. The music featured in the film was great. It also brought out old bad memories from middle school. That one crush that had a girl-friend that went out of her way to make my life hell. But then they broke up. I ended up being stalked by him and now we rarely speak. Back to the movie. It just shows that you should not judge people by who they were when they were younger but who they are now. You never know who you will fall for. He/she could be someone from your past that you over-looked. Or the evil person that made your life miserable for many years. p.s. Name calling in school is rude, i.e. Pissy Missy
