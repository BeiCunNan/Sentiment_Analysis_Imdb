What can I say?<br /><br />Starts off fine and dandy, the usual story, a BRAVE STORY! Downtrodden hero got some family problems make him want to run and hide and make things better. Kid meets kid, second kid has some problems too and a way of making things better. Cue the fantasy world! Real world is tough, fantasy world is tough too but there you have a goal, a reason for being, people to help, quests to fulfill and dark demons to vanquish. Same old same old but done well enough.<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />What were they thinking with the end of this film? What message are they trying to give? Where were they coming from? I was left dumbfounded! My mental ability is not something I brag about so it's possible there are people other than the writers who have a clue about this finale.<br /><br />On TV they showed people leaving the cinema crying after watching this, I think I know why!
