Despite being gruesome and gory (and not for the faint hearted) this movie is a political piece of art and a beautiful representation of love. Give or take slight exaggeration, it portrays a clear example of the media's influences of mindless western masses to an immoral act that the majority of human instinct should be able to over power. I do believe killing is a natural animal instinct that as an evolutionary species, most humans should be able to distinguish as wrong. Yet when these 'natural born killers' create these anomalies of the human being, through media their faults can be praised and cheered, as the decreasing presence of morals, values and individuality of western society become history. But maybe all is not lost in western society. It is uplifting to see a couple truly devoted to each other. However, as this film appears slightly exaggerated in some respects, maybe by removing the rose tinted glasses, it would end in divorce.
