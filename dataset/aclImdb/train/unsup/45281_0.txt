I really cannot understand why films like "Kill Bill" which are based on so much blood and gore are so popular... "Kill Bill" in particular, is 90% ugly scenes and 10% anything else. What is exactly interesting or artful in watching a comatose girl being raped, and then seeing her bite the tongue out of her rapist's mouth?<br /><br />In order to be fair, I must accept that the direction of the film is good. But what difference does this make, when the film in itself is completely unwatchable? I don't object to bloody scenes being shown in a film, provided that they serve some purpose in the plot, and they do not constitute the film's purpose instead (as it happens here).<br /><br />In brief, I find Tarantino completely overrated; what's more, in this film he goes way too low even by his standards. If "Kill Bill" wasn't directed by him, and no stars appeared in it, it would be a typical B-movie. Needless to say, I won't even think about watching Vol. 2. Verdict: 3/10.
