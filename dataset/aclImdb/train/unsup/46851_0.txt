First of all, this made-for-TV film is a sequel. Believe it or not, Guttenburg et al made one of these for the previous Christmas.<br /><br />Well, that on-set experience must have been a good one for them to agree to a second outing. And, in fairness, there's a warmth to the slapstick, seasonal comedy and chintziness which one can laugh along with. Neither is the conceit (i.e. Santa needs a Mrs to get the magic to work) straight out of the stockroom.<br /><br />But, my goodness is it cheap! The North Pole set looks like it was constructed as a one-off for John Stewart's Daily Show while chez Bernard is Texan soap-leased. As are the hairdos. The script IS stockroom, and dusty with it. Guttenburg... well, he's a chirpy chap, but the bags under his eyes make him look as weary as the whole exercise. For all the novelties that got it green-lit in the first place the final half hour is obsequious, indigestive bleurgh. 2/10
