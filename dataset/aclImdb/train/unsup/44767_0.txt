I like the idea behind the plot, but the execution is terrible! To give an example: The main character hurts his foot badly in one scene at the beach -- and right afterwards he runs energetically up the stairs. The script is flawed and non-engaging... The "bad guys" are awful actors, especially the boss. You never get to see him but you can hear his mean evil voice, like this was some kind of Batman movie.<br /><br />=SPOILER= And what about this code? All you hear is some old rabbi mumbling about how important it is, you never get to actually see any of it. Ridiculous. And this secret agency never thought of the idea that the CD may have been copied and distributed? Enough said.
