I've been a fan of Crash since I was 7 and when I was 13 and saw this game I thought it was going to be a breath of fresh air ever since Naughty Dog no longer was in production of this game. When I started playing this game I (at first) liked it but as I continued onward I realized I was wrong. The game-play is common sense like, not challenging but can be at times aggravating because it can get hard and repetitive. The music was catchy the first two or three times you listen to it but can also be repetitive and annoying after a while. The plot is stupid, I learned that Corty and bandiman should NEVER work together. This game is really not for kids due to the adult references it make sometimes but most of the dialogue is stupid tedious retarded bathroom and cheesy pop culture references which you sometimes HAVE to sit watch since they won't let you click off it. Another thing that annoyed me was the fact that Aku Aku SUX at protecting you he's says he will but when you walk into those TNT/Nitro boxes (even if you have three masks) you will DIE!!! Which is stupid, I don't ever recall any Crash game doing that. In other words you can EASILY die in this game!!!! The Characters suck!! Crash-Nothing more than a silent retarded unaware idiot Cortex-He really convinced me that he was some scary cross-dressing gay idiot! The Niece-They seriously jumped the shark when they introduced her to the game!! I hate her that stupid creepy emo brat!!! That's as far as I want to go into these characters I don't want to talk about the rest!! The only thing I like about the game is the graphics. That's IT!!!<br /><br />People if you come across this game avoid it and walk away.... R.I.P. Crash Bandicoot 1996-?2001/2004(by the way the crash series may be dead again once they release Crash of the Titans!)
