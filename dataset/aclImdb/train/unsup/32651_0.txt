I had some expectations that this film would be at least tolerable. However, shortly into the film, which I only paid $4 to see, the disappointments began to appear on the screen. I enjoy Kal Penn, and was hoping that he'd be able to continue his humorous Taj character from the first film. In this movie, there may have been a couple humorous parts that I chuckled at, but the minimal laughter that I expressed was usually directed at the complete absurdity of the plot. The plot was very, very similar to the first film. The few differences that I noticed were that it was in a different location, and the prime players of the film were altered. I would further explain the similarities, but do not wish to ruin it for anyone who still has the desire to view this film for some reason. The jokes seemed forced, the plot was unoriginal, as stated prior, and the movie overall had no purpose in being released to the theaters. The film, also, has little reason to ever be released to DVD; however, inevitably when it is, a price of more than $1.05 is too expensive. The one somewhat positive aspect of the film was that there were attractive females throughout, but I still was very upset that I paid to see this film.
