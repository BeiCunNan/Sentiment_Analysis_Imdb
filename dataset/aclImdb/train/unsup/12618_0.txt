This,the fourth and last of the Matt Helm movies has a lot to recommend it and has serious credentials to be one of the most interesting films of the 60s and that is for a variety of reasons.One of these is the appearance of the late Sharon Tate who gives a very appealing comic performance in her final movie.The attractive 60s star Dahlia Lavi makes a good villainess and is a fine foil for Nigel Greene a respected English actor (who was later to die tragically) as the evil Count Contini.He had played a similar role in the earlier British spy thriller DEADLIER THAN THE MALE.Nancy Kwan also appears and so does Chuck Norris in a "blink and you'll miss him"screen debut.The reason Norris was in it at all was because of the movies' fight choreographer,none other than the legendary Bruce Lee himself and he does sterling work giving the many hand to hand combat scenes in THE WRECKING CREW a zest that was rare in action movies of the period that featured martial arts. All of this does not make THE WRECKING CREW a great movie but it is a highly enjoyable one and certainly the best of the Helm movies.Dean Martin seemed to be having fun as he always seemed to in this role and pound for pound this as good a spoof of the 007 movies as anything in the Austin Powers films.This is as Hollywood 60s as it is possible to get.As relevant to its era as "California Dreamin'."I'm proud to have it in my collection.
