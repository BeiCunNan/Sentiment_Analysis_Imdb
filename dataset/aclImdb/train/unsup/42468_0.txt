One word should be all I need for this review: rubbish. This has to be the most pointless, unfunny, plot less, awful films I have ever seen in my life. It wasn't exciting, the jokes were groan-worthy (although after a while I even gave up groaning), the plot was.. well there didn't seem to be one, being more a selection of scenes thrown together with no reason behind them. I've never seen the original series (didn't even know that there was one), but the TV spots made it look like good fun. How wrong they were... All in all I think the comment from the wife summed it up: "That's an hour and a half of my life that I'll never get back"... enough said!
