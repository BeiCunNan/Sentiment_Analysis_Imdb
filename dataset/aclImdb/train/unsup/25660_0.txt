While you may think that this is a silly concept; Aliens crash land on earth, adapt to the culture, and eventually succeed and prosper, all the while averting capture and deportation by diligent and determined civil serpents of the renowned INS, only to be suddenly rescued by their own kind and returned to their home planet where Beldar is tried and convicted for losing his space ship. <br /><br />Alas, all is not for naught. Using his obviously over-sized brain, Beldar "successfully knarfles the Garthok", using the things he learned and the skills he picked up on earth. <br /><br />In this story there is a life lesson: no matter how difficult the project, how dark the hour, or how vocal one's detractors, one can overcome by putting the old noodle to work and meeting the challenge head-on, just as Beldar did.
