This film is wow. Just wow! I don't know how to describe ?, but its like nothing I've ever seen in Canada or during my vacations to the US.<br /><br />Its funny as hell, but outrageous. It might disgust you. It might shock you. Or it might make you think a lot. It made me do all three.<br /><br />This is no date movie that's for sure and not one for your grandparents or younger sister.<br /><br />I was captivated by the live scenes. They seemed a little different at first, but then they seemed just right by making their points to the story. I loved these twists to the film. Definitely unique and one of a kind.<br /><br />Anyone who wants to laugh at something different has to see ?. Buy, rent or borrow it as soon as you get a chance, but beware!
