In opposition to the previous reviewer (what the hell were you watching - a rerun of Dawsons' or a home video??)<br /><br />Anyways, Popular is without a doubt one of THE best teen tv shows to hit screen in the US/UK.<br /><br />The show has just the right mix of comedy and drama which is reminiscent of Heathers. Even the music used with the show sounds like the same music that was used in Heathers.<br /><br />Yes, the show spoofs 'teen issues' but, also adds its own unique take on them. <br /><br />I think you just have to be able to know when to take it seriously and when to laugh - take note previous reviewer! You need a BRAIN.<br /><br />Anyway - just wish they'd get on with it and put it on DVD. It's the least they could do since they unceremoniously ended the series without a proper resolution (b*****ds!)
