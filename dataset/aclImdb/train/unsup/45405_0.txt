Average crime drama movie that could have been a classic if the ending was not as idiotic as presented here.Great cast with good all around production.There most probably was a FEDERAL censorship issue here which forced the producers to create the idiotic Hollywood ending.See it if only you are a big crime drama movie fan who understands movie production politics.If not,you may regret the time you spent watching this almost great but ruined movie.Fans of the lead actors will enjoy this one as well......
