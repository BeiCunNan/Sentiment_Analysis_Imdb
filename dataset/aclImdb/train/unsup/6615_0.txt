I usually have higher tolerance with sequels since we both know how hard it is to make a good sequel,but this one is TOO AWFUL TO TOLERATE under any circumstances. <br /><br />If you can't have your original cast in a sequel,at least find someone as good as the old one.I find myself picking at the new Paige's over-acting and gaudy appearance all the time.The original Paige was very smart and confident,who's so determined and brave about what she really wants.That's so lovable and inspiring for the audience.Julia Stiles does know how to portray these characters as a civilian queen-to-be. <br /><br />On the other hand,the new Paige has no personality at all.She has nothing for the audience.I don't feel sorry for her at all when she's struggling in this relationship cause I don't even think they're in love,even just a little bit.Persuading the audience is one of the essential parts of acting!!!!!! <br /><br />Apparently,Kam Heskin doesn't know how to be Paige.She's not special or gorgeous enough for the audience to accept her as Paige,especially Julia Stiles made such an excellent precedent.So,maybe I should go easy on her cause I think she might be pretty regretful as well.Just look at her hairstyle and the wedding dress!Looks extremely cheap and low budget!I'll never believe a queen will wear stuff like that!I just don't buy it! <br /><br />If you ever watched Prince&I and very found of it,I strongly recommend you not to watch this sequel.Cause you might die from over disappointed! If you never watched Prince&I,you really should do whatever you can think of instead of watching this.
