I hate Frasier. It is without a doubt the most annoying sitcom ever made. It is proof that a spin off series can never work. Cheers was good and didn't deserve to have Frasier besmirch its memory.<br /><br />I hate it when American sitcoms show characters who have such an easy life. I know sitcoms don't have to be ultra realistic, but come on, no one is like Frasier or Niles.<br /><br />And what the hell is up with Daphne? I've been to Manchester and no Mancunian sounds like her. And she is nothing like any English person who ever lived.<br /><br />The only good character is Eddie the dog. He should have had a series to himself.
