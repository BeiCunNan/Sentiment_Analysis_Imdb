I'm glad to see that some people agree with my 1st review. Its getting harder and harder to find a good zombie movie. Now I just got done watching 28 Days Later, which zombie diaries claims to be better than, and I'll watch it again in about a month or so. Zombie Diaries can remain in the trash can I threw it in. I wanted to pull my eyes out with a cork screw the first time I watched it. Pellet guns, come on. How did this movie even get on DVD? Not even all of John Travolta's movies got on DVD. The Experts, remember that one? At least that one was funny. But, yeah I said but, don't stop trying. How many times did Thomas Edison screw up his whole light bulb thing before it actually worked? Then again he was an American:) I'm just kidding! I'm sure they'll do better next time.
