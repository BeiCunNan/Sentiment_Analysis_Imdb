This was most likely the worst movie I have ever seen. The recipe of putting a monkey named 'Minky', and old lady who can't fit into her leather suit, a stupid bad guy, and an old man spy creates a horrific gumbo of unfunny jokes and 'humorous' actions that aren't even funny to children. I will say, however, that it is a fun movie to watch if you need something to make fun of. The pitiful acting and poor filming make this movie a travesty to modern day movies. Even the extras just make you laugh at their completely unprofessional acting and painful imitations of Japanese people. The plot line is this: super smart girl gets an opportunity to go to a special conference to show her amazing laser. Shock, shock, as it ends up she does not go to any conference, but ends up having to help an evil doctor recreate the impossible 'oxygen laser'. Her father, an ex-spy, finds out and goes to rescue her from the doctor, enlisting the help of his good friend 'Minky' the monkey. Unfunny plot points such as the one in Jamaica in which the monkey speaks in Jamaican to a guy he's is beating up, are all to common. Do not see this movie with the intention of laughing with it. See it with every intention of laughing AT it.
