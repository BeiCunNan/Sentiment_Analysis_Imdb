This movie scared the crap out of me when I was a little boy of just 8 years. My mother had to come into my bedroom and check under the bed every night for at least a week. The plot was unique too. I mean, a gangster (where was Edward G. when they made this?) employing a crazed/mad scientist (I guess there were a lot of them left over from the Los Alamos days) to make nasty looking dead old men crawl through tunnels made of industrial plastic wrap and go kill people. The fact that the scientist could talk to the 'dead guys' and make them do his bidding was the thing that scared me most (Kinda like conglomerate broadcasting of today). These guys were real 'working stiffs' and walked like it too. Excellent blank stares, unsuspecting victims, the 50s-ish people... I guess looking at this movie now, it would seem kind of funny, but in those days, it was a horror movie!
