this movie is absolutely terrible. the script is horribly written, the plot is so weak it caves in on itself, and even the acting doesn't save it. you'd think with a handful of good actors that it would at least be enjoyable. well, it's not. i found myself watching it in fast forward towards the end, because the it just would not end. all of the characters, except maybe malkovich, were unlikable and annoying. you know something is wrong when you get done watching a movie, and you find yourself saying, "oh that malkovich guy did a really good job." this movie tries desperately to be "the big chill", so if you're in the mood for that sort of thing, then rent the big chill, even if you've already seen it a thousand times. 2/10
