The opening sequence is a failure. A closer contact between Jason and the victim could have drawn us into the movie much better. The old formula of sex/nudity + a slasher doesn't appeal anymore. The camera technique, editing, and sound don't work together to keep its audience at the edge of their seats. After the first sequence, you'll know that there is nothing much to expect in this film. For a horror flick to work, the opening sequence should say it all and must entice the audience that this film will scare them to death till the end).<br /><br />This last installment of the Friday the 13th series simply doesn't have "it" to make you want to finish the film. It doesn't bother with the story anymore. It felt like its only goal is to be more brutal than the previous killings. It introduces new characters every after a killing which further alienates the viewers from the film. No depth; no emotional tie up with the characters; each character is simply another object awaiting their gory mutilation. Unless you have a penchant for murders and brutality then this movie isn't just worth your while. Or even if you have a thing for gore, this movie has nothing new to offer--it's a been there, done that kind of thing. So uninteresting.<br /><br />I don't understand why the producers of this series, knowing that this is the last, would not put much thought on how to end Jason's classic plight. OR maybe, it's just that the series have exhausted all there is to exhaust of Jason and this movie hasn't got enough juice to quench the audience for an hour and a half of the worn out, dried up Jason story.
