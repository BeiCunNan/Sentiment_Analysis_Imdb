This is a curious film. Abbott and Costello were only a bit beyond their prime, ready to do the first year of their still beloved television series. Someone, apparently at Warner Brothers, suggested this movie, a low-budget musical comedy filmed in a wretched color process that all but killed the project in itself. Hiring Charles Laughton to do slapstick and Hillary Brooke, quite a talent in herself, must have taken more of the budget than anticipated. The toy ships, the cheap sets, the dreadful choreography, and the forgettable music do little to enhance the low comedy. What an interesting choice for the singing lead: big band singer Fran Warren. She couldn't act worth a lick, but oh those pipes! The song "Speak to me of the Tall Pines" is actually not bad. Her romantic relationship in the film with the totally forgettable tenor is awkward at best. Still, three cheers for Laughton. He steals every scene he's in. But in this crummy film, that isn't saying much.
