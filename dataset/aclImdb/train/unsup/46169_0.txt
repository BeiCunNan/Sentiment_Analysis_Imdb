Please note that this film is almost universally acclaimed so feel free to disregard my comments:<br /><br />2046 is the story of a man who is haunted by a great unconsummated love in his past. It has eaten away at him and he is left unhappy and soulless. He engages in a series of meaningless sexual affairs to try to free himself from his memories or perhaps to find a similar love.<br /><br />The film took 5 years and many revisions to make and this shows. The circular meandering plot is frustrating. The action moves back and forward in time and one place is as empty and soulless as the other. Nothing seems to happen in this overly long film, which ultimately disappoints.<br /><br />Dáithí
