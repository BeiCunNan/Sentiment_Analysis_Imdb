The only reason I would waste time in reviewing this movie is to warn you, the viewer, to avoid it. If you see a clip anywhere, run for the nearest exit. Even I, a die-hard Lana fan, found it boring, lackluster, and downright awful. The only saving grace is more Lana than you've ever seen in any other picture, in costumes of the time that reveal more than it covers. If you're looking for a complex, intelligent, interesting, and faithful adaptation of a biblical story, turn the station or better yet, just read the Bible! I only give it a 2, because of Lana's presence in it. This should be punishment for somebody! If I were Lana and MGM or the studio told me to make this turkey, I would have sued. Did I mention I don't like this movie?
