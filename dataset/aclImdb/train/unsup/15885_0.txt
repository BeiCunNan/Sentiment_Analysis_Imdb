Now let me start out by saying this movie by no stretch of the imagination is a masterpiece, but it is much better than people seem to give it credit for. This is not a movie for the unobservant, if you need the joke to come up and smack you in the face you'll be bored. Some may wonder how anyone can say a movie with a ten minute fart joke could have subtle humor, but it does. The man that owns the Fortune Cookie company having a stereotypically Jewish name and later Ronald Mack(Maurice Patton) asking Mr. Lee(Pat Morita) if there's any Chinese Jews that bit was great and would have received huge laughs if it would have been slipped into an episode of Family Guy. But an example of the most subtle jokes and semi-racial(but they took shots at everyone so who cares) was placing Maurice Patton(who is African-American) directly in front of a Watermelon during the training scenes and makes you feel semi-guilty about laughing at it. Political correctness was very much the enemy of this film.<br /><br />James Lew did a great job poking fun at his career and the fact that despite being a huge cornerstone figure in martial arts cinema being practically unknown by fans of his work and the fact that a fair amount of his contributions have been uncredited. The jokes run the gambit from subtle to direct, a great movie for fans of Kung-Fu or for the highly observant who are not above laughing at a fart joke.
