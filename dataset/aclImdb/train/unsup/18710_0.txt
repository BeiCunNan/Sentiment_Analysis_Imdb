Very, very bad film. Entertainment value is sparse, except for derisive laughter. Racist plot centers around lost tribe of Aryans with ludicrous medallions to identify themselves with. Decent full size paper dinosaurs. I dig Yor hangliding on a pterodactyl, and the fact that the rockin' soundtrack song ("Yor swore he's their man!") only booms out of the movie when something REALLY exciting is happening (which is twice).<br /><br />Star Wars/Conan crossbreeding just didn't work.<br /><br />p.s. that comment was from 2002. Here's my new comment:<br /><br />"Yor" is one of those films that it's really hard to honestly rate on IMDb's 1-10 film scale. I don't really think that the directors were trying to make a film that was poor in the way that this film is poor. For one thing, I've seen more than one film with the name "Anthony Dawson" on the credits, so I know that a lot of his films aren't even this amusing (though a handful are even moreso). Nevertheless, a uniquely entertaining film emerged. <br /><br />Yor (Reb Brown) is a mighty pre-historic hunter who rescues a beautiful woman (Corinne Clery) and her guardian-uncle Paq (Luciano Pigozzi) from a dinosaur and ends up taking them on a long journey to find his homeland (where all the other blonde haired Aryan types hang out, I guess). Along the way he finds the opportunity to hang-glide into caves using a dead pterodactyl (hang-gliding barbarians seem to be normal in these types of film), briefly fall in love with a blonde gal who might be his sister for all he knows, and basically bring about the destruction of each village he visits. Eventually he finds himself on a futuristic island where it's revealed that Yor is the descendant of a rebel leader (sound familiar, Star Wars fans?) who was spirited away from the island to save him from "The Overlord" (John Steiner). All the prehistoric lands Yor has wandered through are the result of a nuclear holocaust (apparently radiation also causes dinosaurs to return to the Earth). <br /><br />Mere words cannot salvage the mess of this film  recycled story "twists" taken from "Planet of the Apes" (which in turn took them from Roger Corman's "Teenage Caveman", a film that more closely resembles this one), questionable racial undertones, papier-mache monsters (and a villain who's barely more substantial than they are), lovely cavegals in cover-girl makeup, an incredible and undiscipherable soundtrack (sounds to me like someone who doesn't speak English trying to phonetically sound out the words "Yor Swore He's Their Man!") which kicks in just at the film's most exciting parts<br /><br />Oh the heck with it, I should just admit that I love this film! I've seen it probably 10 times since I was 14 or 15. I can't even imagine anyone ever taking this film seriously. Except that it's certainly not "campy", so somebody must have thought it would be good. Anyway, speaking of the "most exciting parts", I have to say that the scene with Paq swinging across that chasm on electrical cord (remember I said this one would give you déjà vu, Star Wars fans) hanging from his knees is the greatest thing I've ever seen. Congratulations to you Anthony Dawson, or Antonio Margheriti, or whatever your name is this week  you're the man! But Yor swore  he's our man!
