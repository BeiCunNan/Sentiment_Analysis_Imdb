I love this movie, like most norwegians. Still after all these years watching this movie again and again I still can barely believe it's norwegian! It's just TOO good to be true! Without a doubt one the greatest animated movies in the international history of movies! Too bad it contains so many internal references to norwegian characters and surroundings as these jokes then will be somewhat lost to foreigners, but there's still lots and lots left. This also has my favorite movie-line ever: "Jasså, døk sitt og glor?" :) (it looses a lot when translated)<br /><br />It was sooo sad when Ivo Caprino died, who created this. Maybe, just maybe his son will be crazy enough to make a sequel 30 years later??? I wish!
