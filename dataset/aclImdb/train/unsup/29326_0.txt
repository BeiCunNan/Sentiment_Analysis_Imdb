This is the BEST ROMANIAN MOVIE ever made!!! I laughed for 90 minutes non stop. It's impeccably well directed and it has that Hollywood magic touch. The plot is so unpredictable you can't get bored, and the actors are very good, especially Mugur who plays 2 characters and he transforms himself from stupid policeman into greedy peasant woman, and the roles fit him like a glove. I saw this movie in a theater and everybody was laughing and really enjoying all the gags. It has a lot of visual humor and it's not meant for dull people or for those who lost their sense of humor.<br /><br />IT'S A COMEDY! The BEST Romanian one to date! Alexandra Mutu is just perfect (skin, make-up, clothes...she just sparkles) my favorite scene is a night scene with her and the stupid policeman(played by Mugur)... so perfectly directed...sweet and funny and also a little vulgar...I just could not stop laughing. CONGRATULATIONS to VACANTA MARE! Finally a breath of fresh air in the Romanian filmmaking business!<br /><br />Guys you should go watch this movie if you haven't already! It's worth it!<br /><br />
