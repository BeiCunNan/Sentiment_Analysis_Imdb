In this historical series, there are lots of inaccuracies, as such: While talking to Wosley, the french cardinal says that Pope Alexander is about to die. Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia) died in 1503. Henry VIII didn't became king until 1509. Thomas More says to Cardinal Wosley that he is sorry to hear for the Cardinal Orsini's as Pope. There was actually several Orsini's elected as Pope, but none during Henry VIII reign. The last one before that was Nicholas III (1277) and after that only in 1724 Pietro Francesco Orsini would become Benedict XIII. Several historical sources refer specifically Anne Boleyn's dark eyes, as they were rare in the English court during the 16th century. In the series, Anne Boleyn (Natalie Dormer) has light blue eyes. Henry VIII sends his sister Margaret to marry the King of Portugal. In fact, Margaret Tudor was married to James IV of Scotland. Later she married the Earl of Angus and after that Lord Methwen, Henry Stewart. In 1525 (the year that Charles V armies capture Francis in Pavia, which occurs at the same time in the episode) Portugal didn't have a sick old king. John III was only 23 years old and he married Catherine, Charles V sister, precisely in 1525. It was Mary, Henry's younger sister, not Margaret, who was in love (and later became his wife) to Charles Brandon and was sent abroad to marry a feeble old king. This king was Louis XII, king of France, not king of Portugal. He died 10 years before king Francis was captured in Pavia by Charles V armies (not at the same time, as we are shown in the 4th episode).
