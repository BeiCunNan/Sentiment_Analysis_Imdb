When I heard that this film was a German Black Comedy I was very interested in it, cause I like both German Comedy and Black Comedy. But the combination of them both doesn't work: "Undertaker's Paradise" is surely one of the most boring films I saw this year, not funny and not "black" at all. I liked the Welsh nature you could see in this film, for this I'll give it 3 out of 10, but forget about the rest.
