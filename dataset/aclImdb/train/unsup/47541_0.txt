Women-in-prison flick involving an innocent American tourist in West Germany who is mistaken for a spy, grilled until exhaustion sets in, and sent to jail without a word to her soldier-fianc√©. After publicly nixing her hit "Chained Heat" on just about every talk show of the 1980s, it's amazing that star Linda Blair would even think of doing another jailhouse underachiever. This one, filmed in chilly blues and grays, is just as seedy and depressing. The roster comes complete with a decadently lascivious guard (gaunt, kinky Sylvia Kristel), a terrified blonde, a friendly butch, and lots of malicious broads. And yet the direction is fairly tight, the locales are interesting, and the movie is engrossing almost in spite of itself. As for Blair, she keeps her dignity and has a few strong scenes, including being interrogated and collapsing under the pressure or standing up to the review board with a firm "f*** you!" ** from ****
