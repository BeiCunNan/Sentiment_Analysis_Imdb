Viewed this at a film festival here in Daytona. Anyone who rated this higher than 5 stars were definitely involved in the making of the film. The fact that one of them was from Orlando should tell you something considering that is where the filmmaker is from. The lead role couldn't have been worse. I saw a comment say Zen Gessner was flawless....my god it was just terrible. Zen should never be allowed to have more than a line or two. In fact until this movie and since I don't think he has. The idea was good, but the acting and script were lacking. Avoid this unless you see it in a dollar bin at WalMart and even then you might want to pass.
