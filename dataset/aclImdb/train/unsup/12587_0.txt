this was apparently Warners last big Budget swashbuckler with Errol Flynn, and Don Juan must have clothed him to a T! so to say! After 1925 there was Anna Q Nilsson, Greta Garbo, Ingrid Bergman Signe Hasso, and Marta Thoren and Mai Zetterling! And so it was very fun to see Viveca Lindfors in such a lavish big budget movie! In glorious Technicolor!!! The movie in itself is just such an old matin√©e movie that some TV-channels just show in early morning hours. It's just a fun filled 100 minutes, not to be taken serious! It was directed by Vincent Sherman! much later known for Young Philadephians with Paul Newman in 1959! When did they let Erroll slip their contract?????
