I can't believe people were actually paid for this film. I have never laughed so hard throughout a film. Billy Parrish, the guy who played Joey, where was he found? And the rest of the cast, did the director go out the day of shooting and ask random people on the street... "Hey do you want to be in a movie... no just wear what you are wearing right now that's fine... no, there's no script, just say whatever you want." Also, was the special effects guy paid? Because I'm sure you could have found someone who would have done it for free, then again, you'd have to pay me to add my name to that film. And the camera shots made me feel as if I was watching a soup opera movie. My friends and I want to make the sequel, we plan on using my hand-held camcorder (which I'm convinced the director for this movie used). So does anyone actually own the rights to this film, because I can't imagine anyone would want to.
