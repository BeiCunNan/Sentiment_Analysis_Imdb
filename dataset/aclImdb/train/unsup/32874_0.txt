I love horror movies. I love gore movies. I love movies that make you jump in your seat and make your heart flutter and make you cringe with fear.<br /><br />This movie couldn't possibly be considered anything but a waste of time.<br /><br />It wasn't scary. It had gore - I'll give it that...but it was more dead-bloated-woman-being-mutilated gore than Freddy Kruger or Scream gore.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, I took offense to many parts of the movie. I think it is possible to make a movie about a serial killer that mutilates and humiliates women without doing so on screen. This movie went way beyond the norm and showed graphics and images that most do not want to see. Even those who enjoy horror.<br /><br />I think the only people that enjoyed this move are the kind of people that would actually take pleasure in committing the crimes that occurred in the movie.<br /><br />Do not waste your time.
