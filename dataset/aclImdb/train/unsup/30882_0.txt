Dubbed and low-budget, this horror movie is long, boring, and not particularly interesting except for the parapsychologist whose presence and storyline is wasted, Kevin McCarthy completed wasted, and a plot premise that held promise but wasn't fully utilized by a script that seemed to wander. Fortunately Mr. McCarthy gets to continue to perform in contemporary roles even now, particularly SLIPSTREAM (2007). Michael Moriarity is also not given sufficient opportunity to shine in this movie either. And Mr. Moriarity continues to gain better recognition since this movie. A disappointing movie that really doesn't present anything that isn't better done elsewhere.
