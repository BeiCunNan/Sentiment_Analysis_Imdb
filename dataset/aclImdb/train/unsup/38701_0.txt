Documentary about celebrities who utilize hyperboles (like they should die in a fire while eating a sand hamburger) to describe their critics so you feel sorry for them. The point of this documentary is for you to feel sorry for a celebrity. You should feel sorry. Very sorry. You friggin' sinner. You should go to hell. Maybe not. Still, you should be ashamed of yourself. How could you? Celebrities are like saints and they have feelings. They cry. They complain. They complain a lot. I mean, they complain until the cows come home. Even those who look really, really tough, like they could beat you up, cry and moan. You should know, they would never, and I mean never, criticize you (e.g. they would never criticize your cooking). In conclusion, celebrities are not hypocrites.
