The only other documentary I've seen that is comparable is Gates of Heaven. I love both and I hope more documentaries are available that go beyond the obvious and "documentable" as these do. The voice of god narration and the feeling that you the viewer are being patronized cheapens even most well composed documentaries for me.<br /><br />I&I Rastafari!
