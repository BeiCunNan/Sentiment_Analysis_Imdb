I'm sure many millions were spent making this, but they really shouldn't have bothered.<br /><br />The acting wasn't bad, with Keanu Reeves playing his role well enough. Similarly the CGI was okay, although nothing to be particularly proud of. Where this film is really let down is in the storyline and the dialogue. Its appalling.<br /><br />This is clear right from the start, where leading scientists are gathered to do what appears to be nothing, except of course discuss the end of the world with limp scientific terminology. However, this is nothing compared to the end, and frankly the less said the better, which ironically seemed to be the director's view as well. The fact we are supposed to accept that after planning to wipe out human kind for many years, one alien changes his mind after seeing an upset child and step-mum, is absurd! This film is poor and predictable, and certainly not worth a second look.
