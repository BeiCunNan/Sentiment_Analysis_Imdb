This game is simply fantastic. It catches the unusual feeling of the best dinosaur movies, and by letting us actually play the dinosaurs, it gives us the possibility to go deeply into the story. Player can explore every aspect of The Lost World and see the story from different perspectives - as humans and dinosaurs! But the greatest thing about this game is that by playing it we're actually there, on Isla Sorna. This isn't a game already - this is an ADVENTURE! Great graphics and unforgettable music makes this feeling even stronger. Of course, there are some flaws - the game is extremely difficult at some moments, but despite of this, i guarantee that you won't be able to simply turn off the console and walk away. I recommend TLW to anyone, who loved the movies. It's really, really great.
