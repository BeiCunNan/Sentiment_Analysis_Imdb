Do you know what was Mr. Kubrick's big problem? He just couldn't make a crap movie. He is the only filmmaker who's films had such a quality. So if in my opinion he's a master filmmaker and one of his best films (if not THE best, it is hard to say) is ACO I think a 10 is what this movie should have. And next time you all see this movie don't take it TOO seriously, just try to relax and enjoy it passing by all the possible meanings this movie could have. After all if Kubrick wanted us to know what it is all about we would know!
