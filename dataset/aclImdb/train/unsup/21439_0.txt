This sequel is very well done. There are a few scenes that are a bit choppy because the movie mixes science and horror, but some of the other scenes are just so disturbing and effective, they make up for the mad-science scenes. The acting is once again of good quality. If you liked Ring, Ring 2 is a must-see. Also recommended is the prequel, Ring 0. But before you watch it, purge yourself of all scary expectations.<br /><br />P.S.: My (completely re-designed and re-edited) Asian Cinema website can be found at: www.
