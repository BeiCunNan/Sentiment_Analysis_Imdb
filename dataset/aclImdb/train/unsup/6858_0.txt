Shadow of the Colossus is by far one of the most exhilarating and breath-taking games ever created. It isn't your everyday common shooter, or a repetitive RPG.. no, it's something much different and unique.<br /><br />I played this game when it first came out to the UK in 2005, and rented it from a local movie store. And at first, it was a very challenging game, and I thought the lack of dialogue might have been a disadvantage.<br /><br />But no, I was wrong. It was an amazing and epic game. The designs of the colossi are exhilarating, the vast land was fun to explore, the music was incredibly beautiful, the graphics back than were top-notch, the battles were brilliant and fun, and the story was probably the best...<br /><br />It's a mysterious and quite a sad story, and the ending was unexpectedly tearful, yet wonderfully great! It's left for interpretations, though, but that doesn't bother me one bit.<br /><br />Of course, the only downfall was the camera and the controlling of Agro haha. Otherwise, perfect. :] This game is one of my most treasured games I own, and probably one of the greatest games I've ever played (And I've played hundreds).<br /><br />And so, I give it a 9 1/2 of 10. I recommend anyone to play this game, you might even come to love it!
