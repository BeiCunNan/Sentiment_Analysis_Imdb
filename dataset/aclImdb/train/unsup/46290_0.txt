I love the Inheritance series, but the movie didn't come close. It was done badly. To many key parts were cut out,the "Razack" look like something out of a horror movie, the "urgals" just look like large men, i didn't even know there were dwarfs until someone told me; the twins, Solembum, and Katrina weren't even mentioned. It just wasn't done to it's full potential. I think it was lame and corny. ex: "I'm a princess", "When will i see you again?" And the ending was all wrong. It was just bad in my opinion. My suggestion is to just stick with the books, they are so much, well, more. More complex and the characters are more developed, and the story is fuller. There is more to it than the movie shows. I hope the Eragon is redone in the near future and is done better, and it would be great if the characters look how the are described in the book.For example Aray's looks don't fit her personality, which was also changed.
