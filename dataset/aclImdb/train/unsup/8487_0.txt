Batman (voiced by Kevin Conroy) has been accused of the murder of several mafia members. The former love of his life Andrea Beaumont with her father comes back to Gotham as Bruce Wayne falls for her again, however there's trouble stirring in town as an unknown and mysterious villain called The Phantasm is killing off gangster members one-by-one and The Joker (voiced by Mark Hamil) is next on his list as Batman must find this mystery killer or still be romancing his love.<br /><br />This is in my humble opinion the second best "Batman" movie next to "Begins" which is number one for me while "Batman (1989)" is number 3, this is one of the best animated movies of all time and truly captures the dark essence of the character from his DC comics roots. Bruce Timm (Executive producer, writer and director of the Batman Animated Series) has made the Dark Knight the way he was meant to be in on film but only in animated form as he crafted Bob Kane's famous comic creation into a very special animated movie. It's not just for kids but it's more for older children, teens and adults due to some dark themes, elements and some violence much like the popular animated series, Andrea is a total animated babe and really reflects what Bruce's inner-frustrations lead to once she left him originally.<br /><br />A wonderfully animated and brilliant animated motion picture to captivate both adults and kids alike even the most hardcore Batman fan.
