And this is one of the best that I have ever seen...<br /><br />The portrail of Steven and John are unique and GREAT! I can not think of any better acting for Steven's role as a gay lad who still has to hide from the "bullies" in his school.<br /><br />I really loved the line from John: "Don't leave me." when he was crying on Steven's shoulder in the bed room (if you do not know you should watch the movie).<br /><br />The only thing that I find a prob with it is that it is the typical "coming-out" story. Boy meets and falls for boy but does not get to keep him. I think that this standard needs to be changed.<br /><br />~S
