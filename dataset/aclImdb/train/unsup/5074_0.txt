Pedro Aldomovar is seen as a real genius and personally I think that one film is better than the other but this movie from 1997 certainly belong to the best the Spanish infant terrible has made. In 1970 a woman bears a child in a bus and it's that boy, Victor (Liberto Rabal), who we are going to follow. Victor is an ordinary guy but due to circumstances his whole life will be twisted up as he's the victim from two policemen who are arguing. Like so many other movies by Aldomovar it would be a real spoiler to reveal things as the magic of the movie is to be found in its surprising storytelling that at first doesn't make that much sense but develops itself into a perfect, surprising story. Aldomovar is becoming the master of telling the little things in life and it's in that we can found so much beauty. Also nice to see Penelope Cruz as special guest star, even if she's in it for about 5 minutes. "Live Flesh" certainly is one of Aldomovar's easier movies as for once he gives all the answer even if you have to wait till the end of the movie. A tip!
