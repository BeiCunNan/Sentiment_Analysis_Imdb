If you are one of those who watch with child-like eyes and accept what you see without really demanding believable acting, stunts, story and script, then this movie is for you. The message of the movie was delivered, but it's been delivered many times before and much better. It left me wondering how a good-looking policewoman would get involved with a vagrant? He dresses, acts and lives like a loser and yet--unlike her colleagues who are rightfully wary of him--she becomes involved with him. All of this after a totally unbelievable scene where she is rescued by him after he comes out of nowhere to overpower an armed and dangerous killer who was about to blow her away...I didn't believe it any more than I believed her manhandling several 6 foot 2 inch 200 lb thugs throwing them against the car and handcuffing them like they were match sticks. Boy is she strong!! This movie is not worthy of taking up theatre time and space. 4 out of 10
