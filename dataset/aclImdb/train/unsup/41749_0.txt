This film can't decide how to use the the cast it has. John Cleese is unconvincing as a Sheriff, Danny Glover misses Mel Gibson as a funny Man, and Kevin Kline demonstrates yet again he does not have as broad a range of talent as his press releases suggest.<br /><br />Kevin Costner hams it up, and the film would have been better directed by Mel Brooks. Its far too long and pointless.
