This is based upon the Special Edition. I've been wanting to watch this for years, and I was not disappointed in the least. In fact, I could not take my eyes off this for a second. This takes place in the future, in a post-apocalyptic time where natural food is so difficult to come by, it's used as currency. A butcher decides to take on this problem with a very hands-on solution... cannibalism. The story is well-told. Editing and cinematography is amazing, and this has some unforgettable images and sequences. The black comedy is hilarious, and hardly any joke or gag falls flat or feels forced. Characters are well-developed and interesting. Everyone is well-cast, including Pinon, who keeps getting hired, and with good reason, by Jeunet(whose efforts I continue to follow with great anticipation for every production of his that I get to view). The acting is flawless, even the kids are convincing. This has a great pace, and is not boring for a second. I don't know enough to say if the concept is completely original, but it didn't remind me of anything I've seen or read before(I hear that at least one aspect is similar to Brazil, though). This is immensely creative and imaginative. The script contains plenty of surprises. This builds atmosphere impeccably well, and is rather exciting when it goes for that. Parts of this are rather surreal. Not speaking enough French to judge it, I can only comment on the understanding of the dialog that I got from the English subtitles; a lot of it is quite clever. There is a little strong language, a couple of hints at sexuality and several instances of disturbing content. The DVD comes with an excellent director's commentary(albeit sans Caro, since he does not care for them), two featurettes that I will review on their individual pages here on the site, a teaser, a trailer and a photo gallery. I recommend this to any fan of this style of humor, dystopian settings and/or the duo of Jean-Pierre and Marc. 8/10
