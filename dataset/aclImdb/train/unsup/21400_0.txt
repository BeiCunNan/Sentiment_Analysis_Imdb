"Angus" is one of the most true to life, humorous and dramatic films I've seen in a long time. Talbert did a very good job portraying Angus and so did Kathy Bates and George C. Scott as Angus' mother and Grandfather. It was good to see Ariana Richards in a movie besides "Jurassic Park" and "Tremors." I have no clue on why she doesn't do more acting. She did a very good job. <br /><br />All in all, the film was wonderful.
