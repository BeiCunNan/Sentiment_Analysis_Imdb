I thought this movie was an excellent change of pace from the over-acted, glossy big studio releases. The characters are interesting and the plot is not just another stock rerun. It even managed to pull off an upbeat ending without coming off as sappy. Its definitely a light hearted movie without any massive conflict to work through or ground breaking issues to explore. It has a very laid back, slice of life, feel. Great movie to rest your mind on.<br /><br />
