'The Wolf Man' is a likable but completely unremarkable addition to the Universal horror stable. With such transparent effects as pentagram scars drawn on with pencil crayon and werewolf transformations that simply dissolve from a pair of bare legs to a pair of hairy ones, this isn't exactly the most sophisticated movie, even for its time. It lays on the werewolf mythology pretty thickly, in particular the unconvincing dictionary definition of lycanthropy that opens the movie, and the poem that several characters repeat boringly throughout. There's not much chemistry between the actors: Lon Chaney Jr. and Evelyn Ankers don't convince as a possible couple, and Chaney and Claude Rains don't convince as father and son. It's all very run of the mill. I think my favourite part was the completely irony-free bit where a priest tells an old pagan gypsy woman: "Fighting superstition is as hard as fighting Satan himself!"
