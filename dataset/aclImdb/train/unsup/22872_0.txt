I saw this movie on TV in the 70's and it had a tremendous impact on me. It was brilliantly acted and the chemistry between Christina Raines and Cliff De Young made their on-screen relationship very convincing and very tender. A real tear-jerker! I bought John Denver's album just for the songs 'Lady' and 'Sunshine' which featured in the movie and were used in a very poignant way to show the wonderful love that Cliff De Young's character had for his wife. Her smile as he sang 'Lady' was captivating! I can see it now in my mind after all these years. My sister and I recorded ourselves singing 'Sunshine' and 'Lady' for fun after seeing the movie only to discover just weeks later that she too had a terminal illness and died very soon after. I still have the audio cassette, which is a constant reminder to me of the film. I've tried to find this movie on video or DVD but to no avail. How can we get someone to put this excellent movie onto DVD? It needs to be 'out there' or at least repeated on TV or Sky so we can record it! One of the most memorable little movies I've ever seen.
