I just saw this movie- in fact its still going on- at the Miami Film Festival and it is another movie about people making movies in Hollywood. It's just slow and boring and the character interactions are on the level that you could find in your own household. It drama over money and families and who cares, its mundane and not very interesting. I'd say of the 42 people that showed up, 10 have left already. The story is about a couple trying to make it in the film industry and failing at it, so now they have to decide if they are gonna try to keep working on movies or if they are going to begin their real life with their child. There go two more people from the theater.
