when people ask you about Christmas films, what do bring up? The Grinch, the Rankin-Bass stuff, a Christmas carol, Santa clause 3? this is obviously the most boring film i ever saw (folowing Bee movie and Pinocchio 3000). the series is about adding laws to Santa Claus (exciting enough!) this one adds in Jack frost (played by Martin short) trying to take Santa's place. he does this using the "escape Clause". how does it work? simply make Santa touch a snowglobe and say "i wish i was never Santa". what makes a film worse than a boring story? actors who don't give a $#!t. Peter Boyle (Young Frankenstein, everybody loves Raymond) died after this movie! P.S i recommend Scrooged over this! (every one would)
