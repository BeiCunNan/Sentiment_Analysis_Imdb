Salman's comedy films like HELLO BROTHER, MAINE PYAAR KYUN KIYAA are terrible But this film is even worse A remake of BRUCE ALMIGHTY, but a bad one It's boring and keeps getting worse First few reels between Salman- Priyanka and Salman- Anupam are as boring as ever and Salman's shouting worsens And if this isn't worse Enters Sohail Khan trying to do a Akshay in MSK and the film gets even worse, unbearable their scenes together are so bad, that you will surely get a headache the twist in the tale too seems illogical and the second half gets even more childish The lie detector is okay but the way the film ends it's even more stupid<br /><br />Rumi Jaffrey seems inspired by his mentor David Dhawan and follows his Style too much but sadly fails in handling the film Music is outdated SFX too is bad<br /><br />Performances are mediocre Salman is unbearable in first half, he shouts too much and his dial delivery is also bad, in second half he is better but sadly nothing even good enough Sohail is even worse, he is bad Priyanka Chopra doesn't have anything to do Dalip Tahil, Anupam Kher are average Amitabh seems to have walked out of a Rein and Taylor ad and just moves around with a know it all smile but his presence does uplift some scenes
