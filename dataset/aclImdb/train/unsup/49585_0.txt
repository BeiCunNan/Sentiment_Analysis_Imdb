Detective Porhowski (Sarah-Jane Redmond) is trying to find out what's happening in her town. Ryan James (Michael Eklund) says he was in a nightmarish place where some supernatural evil was killing people based on sins they've committed. As she delves deeper into this crazy story, the more she realizes that it might not be as crazy as she once thought it was.<br /><br />Supposedly this was based on a true story due to some priests' notes or something like that. Basically it's their way of saying, 'this could possibly happen, so we'll say it did happen and make people believe it happened, even though it never really did happen.' Yea, they tried to manipulate the general audience, to little avail.
