Take a look at the biography of Paul Laverty on this site . A truly remarkable and gifted individual who has led a very interesting life . What a pity then that he didn't sacrifice some of his lust for life by reading up on what makes a good story . Sorry if I'm sounding bitter or personal towards Mr Laverty but is there any type of market for this movie ?<br /><br />BREAD AND ROSES is the story of Maya , an illegal immigrant from Mexico whose sister Rosa gets her a job as a janitor . Being a non union service the work supervisor can hire and fire people on a whim so Maya with some others organizes " A Justice For Janitors " campaign <br /><br />I do concede that not every movie can be LORD OF THE RINGS in epic scope , technical ability or just plain excitement but really who is going to stand out a cinema in the pouring rain wanting to buy a ticket for something like this ? One things for certain - There won't be a long queue in front of you if you do decide to see it <br /><br />I do concede that Ken Loach directed movies are very popular . But only with people obsessed with " social realism " and once again Loach directs a movie with zero commercial appeal . Anyone who has attended any worthy film class will realise there is no longer ( If there ever was ) any type of market for this type of film . Of course some very privileged people who are professional socialists will scream that we need film makers like Loach and Laverty in order to point out the grave injustices of the socio economic divide but I suggest that India , a country that personifies the injustice between the haves and have nots , has perhaps the most successful film industry in the universe and there's no such thing as " social realism " in a Bollywood movie <br /><br />The bottom line for Loach and Laverty is : If you want to send a message try Western Union
