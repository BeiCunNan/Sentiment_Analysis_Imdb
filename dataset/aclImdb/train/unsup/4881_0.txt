I saw the play, the one-woman show years ago, and went to see Julie Harris (from Grosse Pointe) in her dressing room, after the show. I had to tell her how moved I was, and how amazed that she had BECOME Emily Dickinson.<br /><br />Years later, as I watched the video, I was riveted to the screen and many times moved to tears to actually experience the tenderness, passion and acerbic wit of the great poet. I regaled in her joys and suffered her frustrations and disappointments. She showed the world what a person can do with loneliness and spinsterhood. Dickinson had a unique talent and will go down in history as one of America's finest poets, and Julie Harris made the person vivid and believable. The range of her acting talent was remarkable, as she went freely from light humor and delight to deep passion and excruciating emotional pain. And she relished in the fact that she was a nonconformist who disturbed the gossips around her.
