This show is probably my all-time favorite episode of any television show I've ever watched. I'm a retired Marine and this episode never fails to move me to tears. The loneliness of Corporal Yost and what it has done to him is one of the reasons. When they are reading the Medal of Honor Citation and pan onto Charles Durning as he shuffles along the hallway always brings tears to my eyes. The last scene in the Sushi Bar is another one that I find touching... especially the last lines. I can't think of "Begin the Beguine" without seeing Ernie and Kate dancing. Just a marvelous piece of writing and acting. Thanks to the cast and crew for a wonderful and touching performance. It doesn't surprise me at all that the writer of this episode worked on "Moonlighting" and "Hill Street Blues". Thanks, Roger Director for a great story. Thanks, Don Bellisario... from another Marine for this episode and this show.
