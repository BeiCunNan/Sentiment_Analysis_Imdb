If you remember the first movie at all, and you approach this movie with an open mind, you will find OblIVion quite satisfying. Though not as atmospheric as the first movie, there are several creepy scenes scattered throughout, including the opening scene and a dream sequence involving Reggie. In addition, there are several scenes from Phantasm (I) cleverly woven into the storyline creating continuity between the two films. Some, but not all questions are cryptically answered, which steadfastly adheres to the "nothing is as it seems",non linear flow to the movies. It definitely leaves room for one last movie. Maybe the last movie can spell it out (or at least somewhat) for "phans" needing closure.<br /><br />In conclusion, if your not a fan of the Phantasm movies, or are just randomly renting movies out of boredom, I strongly suggest you don't bother and keep your cynicism to yourself. But if your willing to at least watch the first film, or if your addicted to Phantasm I, Phantasm IV will clearly keep you wanting more.
