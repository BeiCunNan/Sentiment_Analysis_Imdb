I'm a sucker every time for Hollywood video's 4 for $20 sales, meaning I find two I really want and then have to find two that might not be TOO bad but I'm generally WRONG about that. And here is one of my two rejects, "One of Them", some low budget ca-ca about some teens that were on their way to see where one of them grew up and crash after a bug invasion. I guess they find themselves at this college or university, The School of Hard Knocks, I reckon, as that's about what they're going to get as they run away from other dead teenagers or SOMETHING, it's not often that I watch movies that are this incoherent. So incoherent was it that I declined to watch the whole thing and instead wasted still more time watching "Shadows of the Dead" so if you like you can read my review on that hunk-o-junk too. 1 out of 10, and only because the numbers go no lower than 1. Abysmal.
