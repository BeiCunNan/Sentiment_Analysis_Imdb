Mario Bava's TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE (aka BAY OF BLOOD) is often noted as one of the main influences of the more modern "slasher" film, including Friday THE 13TH and many others. It's influence is obvious in these new films, and Bava's film, though older, is just as strong, if not more so than it's numerous followers.<br /><br />The film starts with an aging land-owner (or bay-owner, to be more precise...) who is murdered in the first scene. Her killer is then murdered right after - putting the wheels in motion for 11 more grisly deaths. It seems that there is great dispute over who owns the bay and what is to be done with the property, and all those that try to "gain" from it are brutally dispatched...<br /><br />TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE is a fine "classic" slasher that gets lost in it's own storyline. As the killer/killers are hashed-out, the story begins to lose some momentum in trying to reconcile itself. Regardless - slasher fans will probably pop a boner for this one, as most of the deaths are pretty twisted, even by today's slasher-standards. Definitely a must-see for the genre fan...8.5/10
