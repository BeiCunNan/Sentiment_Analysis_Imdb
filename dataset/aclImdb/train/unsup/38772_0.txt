This could have been a good movie , not a brilliant one mind you.Sadly the cutting of this movie makes you go ...Hang on a minute why is he ..or how is that ...oh i give up. A Vin Diesel movie always show great action at least you say ,well....Not this time who ever filmed most of the fights must have been on some form of medication since the cuts are so fast it made for painful watching, At times i felt motion sickness set in.To bad that this movie that could have gotten a solid 8 instead of a 4 was not better put together. I for one cant recommend it to anyone,I will how ever try to get my hands on the longer version that is supposed to exist and see if they manage to salvage the promise this movie almost showed.
