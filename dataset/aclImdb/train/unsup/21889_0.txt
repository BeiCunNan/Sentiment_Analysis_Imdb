Words can't describe my feelings after I saw the story of Elephant Man - I cried almost the whole movie. As I know the whole story is true - there is almost no fiction in it (as in Braveheart for example). John Merrick is simply beautiful. This is the most touching story ever filmed and it changed me a lot. I highly recommend it to everyone. 10 out of 10.
