Only this and the Bourne Identity have a car chase that I rate this high, the fact that it was filmed in Paris actually added to the authenticity of the chase.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and aside from the car chase, I still get 'tingles' when watching the fight scene with the tall and short guys in the office, the soundtrack playing during this scene works very well with it.<br /><br />This is Jet Li at his best, without too much fighting, which (although I love it) can sometimes become a bit tiresome if you just get fight scene after fight scene.<br /><br />Excellent use of the soundtrack, blistering stuff, which I can't rate less than 10!
