I thoroughly enjoyed this hard-to-find short. I bought mine from ebay, which is the only place I could find it playable in North America. I agree that the dialogue seems a bit "off". I think it sounds like a poem. As usual, D'onofrio brings the film to a whole new level with his brilliant delivery and extreme "likeability". The film had a surreal quality to it, sort of like a dream, and I liked the lighting effects. The snake scene had to be one of my favorites. Oh, the kissing in the hot tub as well, so hard to choose. D'onofrio keeps you glued to the screen, and may I add he is tooooo hot for words in this, I kept wishing the nude scenes would include him moving that sheet! Yes, I am a perv:)
