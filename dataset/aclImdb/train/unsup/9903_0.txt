The tension in "Lighthouse" is pretty unbearable. In fact, you don't even have to like or care for any of the characters (phew) to feel the danger as much as they do. I mean, this killer is just really creepy, for once I didn't want him to finish the job, he's not the funny, playful mass murderer like Jason is. There are whole bunches of exciting scenes in this movie, it's not exactly Hitchcock but it'll do. We get lots of typical scenes: the standard fat guy sequence, people splitting up for really vague reasons, the supposedly highly-educated stupid woman being stupid and annoying all over the place, a lot of fire, the works, filmed to perfection. Not written to perfection but it's a slasher, nobody cares.<br /><br />The only thing that's really too bad is that the killer stopped being mysterious by the end. He was just like a Bond-villain after a while, even with the idiotic laughter and everything. That really spoiled things. I suppose I shouldn't make a big deal out of it but I do.
