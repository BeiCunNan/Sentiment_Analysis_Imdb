Over the top John Woo action flick that works with Travolta as a devious villain, but fails miserably because of the obvious miscasting of Slater as an action star. Mathis is also way off as a park ranger, or something like a park ranger. Maybe she was looking for the set where they were filming the latest Yogi Bear movie.
