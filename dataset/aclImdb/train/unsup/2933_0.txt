When I first read the story, I thought it would be fun to see an ordinary thief change into a legendary general! But what I have seen is more than just a comedy! It is truly an epic on small scale! And a comment on the political situation of North and South Korea! The excellent combination of humor,drama,a little bit of science fiction and a lot of action makes this a movie not to miss! The cast is great and the story is wonderful! It never get's boring! Before you know it the movie is over! The beautiful cinematography and some nice cgi effects make the viewing experience even more intense and pleasurable! I know that some viewers will be put off by the time travel aspect in the story! It is only used as a tool! The focus is on the characters and their actions! The spectacular finale is truly a heroic bloodshed! I enjoyed "Heaven's Soldiers" immensely and I think that it certainly deserves a higher rating than it got! Trust me this is an amazing movie!
