I'm not exaggerating when I say that after the first half of this movie, the whole film was a big letdown. The movie took a decidedly dark turn, especially when Christopher Walken revealed himself as the Angel of Death. I mean, c'mon! You go from farting in David Hasselhoff's face to this dramatic turn. It just didn't fit.<br /><br />Plus, you could tell in the second half of the movie that the writers tried desperately to throw in funny parts during the really dramatic scenes to remind the viewers that this was a comedy. But the funny parts really just collapsed under the weight of the heavy drama.<br /><br />I'm a really big fan of Adam Sandler, but this movie didn't do it for me the way his earlier films did. Sandler's really funny in comedies like "Happy Gilmore" and "The Waterboy". He can also do drama really well, as the underrated "Punch Drunk Love" and "Spanglish" showed. However, the movie makers tried to mix the two in this movie, and it really didn't work.<br /><br />What upset me even more was the cop-out ending when Adam Sandler wakes up in Bed, Bath & Beyond realizing the whole experience was a dream. Did this ending remind anyone of the awful Elijah Wood vehicle, "North"? That's exactly how that movie ended, and I was astounded an Adam Sandler movie would stoop to end that way.<br /><br />Additionally, his troubled times come when he fast forwards through waiting for his promotion after months of working on a project. The whole time I was sitting in the movie theater, I was thinking, "Why didn't he just push 'pause' and do a majority of the work? That would have made a whole lot more sense, not to mention given him more time." He said he didn't have enough time to do things, so why did he want to fast forward?<br /><br />Well, it's complicated, but I think the movie could have been much better in a lot of ways. For one, it was advertised as a comedy and it should have stayed that way throughout. There should have been a few dramatic points to make the film at least a little bit legitimate, but when it got heavily dramatic, that's when the film really jumped the shark.<br /><br />Oh, and one other thing. Kate Beckensale is a decent actress, but she doesn't look like a woman who has had two kids. That's all.
