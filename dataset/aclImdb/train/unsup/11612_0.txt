This is the most enjoyable movie I have ever seen: hilarious situations, unforgettable lines, car chases, characters you care for, and even a dramatic scene that makes me cry every time. A real American classic: call it a road movie, action comedy, buddy film, whatever---it's a beautiful script, professionally executed. What a country, huh? What a country!<br /><br />My friends and I rented this movie to celebrate a reunion after 12 years, and we were rolling with laughter in five minutes. Don't watch the TV version if it's got the f-words edited out---they are very important to the experience.<br /><br />I can't believe: (a) this movie didn't get an Oscar, (b) it's not well known even in the U.S., and (c) there's no DVD version available any more. I want to buy it! Why don't they want to sell it???<br /><br />
