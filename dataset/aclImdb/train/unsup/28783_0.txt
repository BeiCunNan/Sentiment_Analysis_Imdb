Before i geared up to watch this movie, I hadn't expected much (which perhaps fuelled my enjoyment even more) as other reviews on the internet promised bad fighting sequences and flat acting. I beg to differ, however. The korean lead brings with him a series of quirky expressions and is very likable, and Shu qi's stoic attitude makes his wild expressions stand out all the more.<br /><br />Despite not knowing each other's mother tongue, it is altogether believable that their marriage would work out, given Shu qi's entourage's quirky mistranslations that turn anything they say into sweet nothings. (Think about it, they would never have the chance to argue!) I entirely recommend watching this, as it had me rolling around in laughter. The first 5 minutes or so may be a bit of a drag, though-however, it is well worth enduring.<br /><br />My advice for anyone who has yet to watch it? Don't take it too seriously!
