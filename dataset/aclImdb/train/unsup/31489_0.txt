Greatest movie ever seen on the big screen!!The performances are nothing short of fantastic .Hrithik Roshan becomes Akbar and not once do you feel you are watching Hrithik on the screen. He is beyond brilliant and carries the film on his broad shoulders throughout. The way he emotes and delivers his lines shows that he is a super performer. This easily has to rank as the best performance of his career.<br /><br />Aishwarya Rai Bachchan matches Hrithik and delivers a wonderful performance as well. she looks ethereal Â— a compliment she has heard a trillion times before. What's new in that? But watch her emote in this film. Although she does not have as many lines to deliver or have as much screen time, she still makes you sit up and take notice of her through her extremely expressive eyes. She emotes superbly with them and it only enhances her performance. This will go down as one of her career best performances. Also, the Hrithik and Aishwarya chemistry is as flawless as ever. They sizzle every scene they are in together.<br /><br />My advice to the audience is to not miss Jodhaa Akbar because doing so would be a huge mistake. It is a masterpiece and a definite must see. Don't miss it!
