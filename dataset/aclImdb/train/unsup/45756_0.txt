Jennifer Marsh (Diane Lane) is cyberspecialist working for the FBI countering hackers and other cyberscum. Typically low-key stuff like cornering geeks trying to steal bank details or closing down kiddie porn sites. But this time around it's a whole different shenanigan - a brilliant hacker sets up a website, where he kills people and the website popularity determines how quickly the victim dies. Stuff gets bloody, while Jennifer has no clue how to intercept or capture the perpetrator. Meanwhile the death-toll rises and the clicks skyrocket...<br /><br />My main gist with the movie is that it tries so hard to be tech savvy and to some extent it is (most of the tech lingo and solutions are perfectly fine and most of the iffy parts are passable for pure cinematic purposes). But after letting us know how brilliant the FBI team is we quickly find out how incompetent they really are. For example it is quickly discovered that the hacker has his DNS server in Russia. Given this isn't the middle of the Cold War and that a person is being killed online I would think that the Russian authorities would be normal enough to close down such a site at the FBI's request... c'mon! Add to that various extremely stupid character behaviours topped off with our hero falling for a trap that is so obvious, that only a senile mental facility patient could fall for...<br /><br />Other weaknesses - I didn't really feel any build-up and the online killing theme seems underused for dramatic purposes (millions of people watching and we get no feedback as to how the general public is reacting to it).<br /><br />That and I hate torture porn. Why did I watch the movie? Guess I decided to torture myself with a crap picture on a Saturday evening...
