I'm not going to do a very deep review for this. I'll be honest, I saw this movie in a $3.99 bin at a grocery store and read the synopsis, and I had to buy it to see if it was as ridiculous as it sounded. Basically, Freedom Deep is the story of Liam, who, under the guidance of his mentor "Kurt Cobain" (yes, THE Kurt Cobain. The heroine addict lead singer of Nirvana who killed himself), begins to create a new religion based on his teachings. The story follows Liam simultaneously through the year 1998 as a 10 year old kid and in the year 2018 as a friggin idiot. As a kid Liam is shown beat up and neglected. He and has a revelation one night as he hallucinates the image of "Kurt Cobain" (!) at a hippy party. From that moment on Liam knows his purpose in life, though I'm kind of glad he didn't really share it with the audience. In 2018, the world has gone through an apocalypse and Liam is ready to journey to the last remains of civilization to spread the word of Kurt Cobain. And through facing difficult obstacles he does just that! Go Liam! The music is trippy, the acting is great considering there's no dialog, and the film processing attempted to have a fresh hip look, but ended up being annoying. I didn't even get the laugh I was hoping for.
