Having Vinnie Jones star in this movie was indeed the one and only redeeming quality of this one. But even he could not save this film...and I use the term film loosely. Should go with cartoon! I'm a huge Vinnie Jones fan and his character didn't disappoint, but everything else did. Movie was about Vinnie vs "Baby Ruth" man from the Goonies! So lame, we laughed like it was a good Seth Rogan flick! Vinnie just couldn't carry the lameness of the Baby Ruth guy. You just couldn't take the protagonist seriously at all. Please don't disappoint us again Jones. Also we were robbed out of a boob shot with the hot chic in the shower, and thats just not cool at all. Every horror/suspense flick is required to have a boob shot of a hot chic! It's just a manditory thing.
