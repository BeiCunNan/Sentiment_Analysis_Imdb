The third film in the Dirty Harry series is more of a regular action film than a Dirty Harry movie. It has a plot so basic it was probably thought up in 5 minutes. Still, that does not make it a bad movie. Harry still focuses mostly on tracking down the bad guys so there's plenty of good action. I liked SUDDEN IMPACT more but this is definitely better than THE DEAD POOL. If you are either an action fan or an Eastwood fan, go out and pick this, its a fun movie. 4/5
