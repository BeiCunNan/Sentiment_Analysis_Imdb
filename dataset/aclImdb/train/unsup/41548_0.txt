THE BREED could have been a good movie, or at least an average movie. The result, alas, is quite poor. Adrian Paul plays a vampire who, it seems, has been living under a rock because he seems unaware of all the contemporary slangs used by his human partner (who is also a cop). The duo are chasing a vampire serial killer, but there's a conspiracy they aren't prepared for going on in the background.<br /><br />As a vampire movie, THE BREED borrows heavily from BLADE in look and vibe. The East European setting, with the old buildings and whatnot, provides the movie with its only plus -- it's very nice to look at, even if the fog machine gets a rather strong workout. <br /><br />As for story, THE BREED attempts to be BRAZIL, and provides allegory to Nazi Germany. There's very little subtlety, and Nazi-inspired signs abound. The filmmakers are so blatant with pushing the whole allegory motif that it becomes rather irritating. Yes, we get it. GET ON WITH THE MOVIE.<br /><br />3 out of 10<br /><br />(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie and reviews of other genre and Indie films)
