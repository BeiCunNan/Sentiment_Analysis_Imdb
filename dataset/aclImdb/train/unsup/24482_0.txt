Remo Williams was the pilot episode for a TV series which was never filmed. It was only seen by viewers in some US cities, as a major speech by President Reagan at the Republican National Convention pre-empted it in most areas. I suspect that most viewers out West who did see it were so numbed by its dullness that they've forgotten.<br /><br />The writers stuffed every stereotype, every stock character, and every banality they could fit into the pilot. Every tired joke is played out; every move is telegraphed. Even McDowell and Meek couldn't do much about the stale dialogue and poor directing.<br /><br />Sadly, the depth of character, original humor and slight moral ambiguity of the original movie and the books on which it was based were erased in a weak attempt to cater to the lowest common denominator. It didn't work.
