This film defines the term "watchable average" ,,, Forget the critics ,, It slowly goes no where with its Pretty Boy Heath Ledger,Kneau Reeves guilt ridden Depressant ,, and Geof Danniels is the only person who manages to deliver. Its a 3 out of 10 and I seriously think those pretentious American sycofants in Rotten Tomoatoes who give it high marks have been watching too much Jerry Springer ,, Sam Raimi's Simple Plan delivers far greater punch or the much underrated 'The Score'. Seriously the plot has some incredulous turns and is ridden with 'Cliches' and drags on and on and on and on !. This youngster belongs in an American teen drama.. And the most annoying 'Night Rider esqu ' Soundtrack is straight out of an 80's Nightclub.. If you reach the end of this contrived nonsense without asking the question can 'someone Lookout for the Director and give him a slap' I will buy you a banana sandwich and glass of milk <br /><br />Seriously avoid at all costs <br /><br />Watch the Australian Classic ' The Noise !!!
