I actually enjoyed the first Cheetah Girls Movie. But The Cheetah Girls 2 was promoted so much, it made me sick. Then when I actually watched it, it was worse. The plot is exactly like the first movie, with Galleria becoming controlling and the others go off and do other things. Then they all make up and everything is great. They all play spolied brats who cant sing. They make decisions too fast and the movie is rushed. Its hard to follow. Now I'm not against Raven's weight or anything (not all stars should be a size 3) but she has gained a few pounds in the last 2 years. Her hair looks like a mess too. Raven is a pretty person, they could make her look better than they did. The lines in the movie are fake and too rehearsed. The morals are pretty boring and stupid too. No one actually lives their life like that.
