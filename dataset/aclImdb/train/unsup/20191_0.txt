I'll be brief, though the length of this video film is everything but short. The director announced that he was influenced by the works of fassbinder, Solondz and Waters. Now I love Fassbinder, I also admire the work of Solondz, About Waters who's not one of my favourits I can say he's naughty, wickedly naughty(in a way I guess it's a compliment as well). But I didn't see a trace of these in Spencer's film. It's far from being sharp as Solondz' work, It's far from being daring, amazing, heart breaking and visually stunning as any of the Fassbinder films. It's an ugly film, most of the time written and acted badly, photographed poorly and I'm not talking on video problems. The ugliest Dogma film looks better then this. It's a waste of time and the composer had a nerve to try to create emotion with his music. I wish I could say something about the story, the characters, anything-good or bad but I can't, nothing left. I find bad films much more interesting then good ones, because u can understand what the director meant and see were he got lost. But here-absolutely nothing.<br /><br />on the other hand this film won 3 awards ! So I guess it's either my problem or someone else's Sorry, but being daring I guess is far from doin' good.
