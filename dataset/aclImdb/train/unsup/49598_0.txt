I never had such a good time making fun of a movie until this feature-length Hercules episode came along. Everything seemed to have been fished from the bottom drawer: lame flaming swords (gosh, could those be their attempts at light-sabres?), scrap-metal artifacts, second-rate hell-beasts, and an ensemble of clowns. All thrown in with that wannabe fantasy-epic intro. My friend and I were left with eyes watering and bellies aching from almost non-stop laughter. One of those flicks which are so bad they're actually good.
