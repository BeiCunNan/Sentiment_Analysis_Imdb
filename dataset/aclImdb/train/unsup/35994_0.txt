Lucy Lawless must have needed a payday very badly to sign up for this opus.<br /><br />Genetically enhanced locust (created by the evil military) are terrorizing the countryside, and the evil military only seem to want to consider chemical or nuclear options to fix it.<br /><br />The plot is moronic, the characters wooden, the acting bad, and the special effects look cheap.<br /><br />This is the worst piece of drivel I've seen in years. There is nothing to recommend it. Avoid at all costs.<br /><br />Xena, where are you when we need you?
