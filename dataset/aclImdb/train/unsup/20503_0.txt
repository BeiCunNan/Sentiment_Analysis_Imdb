This movie is only the shadow of the original. Nice girls (except one:) but nothing else- no new ideas, it's just a boring English remake with cheaper artists. Neither they just didn't looked for a fat enough stunt... I do NOT recommend this movie, except if you didn't seen the french version. Maybe it's too difficult to realize a Luc Besson movie without Luc Besson. The American artists at this level are simply not enough talented to even make me laugh. Also, the screenplay (re)writer tried to not copy the original, and his tries was funny- Brazilian girls instead of German men, female taxi driver with loving boyfriend instead of male driver with hot girlfriend - the writer tried to use the negative of everything, but it's not a remake, it's the style of a child who copies his friends lesson. Bad movie!
