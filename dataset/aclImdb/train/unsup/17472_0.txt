"To Hell and Back" is a good war movie, but it would have been better if Audie Murphy narrated the movie instead. He should have had a younger actor play his part. When Murphy went into the war he was seventeen years old and looked like fourteen. When he made the movie, it was over ten years later where he looked older so the story was less believable. In real life, the men Murphy served with gave him a hard time because he looked like a kid. The older Murphy in the movie did not look inexperienced, innocent, scared, or young enough. Murphy was too mature to play himself a decade later. The point of the movie was how a kid became a military leader in the Army.<br /><br />However, the story is still good. Even better, the casting was superb. Many of those actors became recognizable faces from television years later. It is the only movie where those actors were given good film roles. It's fun to watch those guys doing good work.
