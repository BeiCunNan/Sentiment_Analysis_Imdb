We must live in a really sick and deranged world if this tripe ranks at 7,9 out of 10!! ...and then we wonder how on Earth something like the Columbine High School Massacre could happen? Well, that's one of the answers - teach a kid that violence is fun and decapitations of cutesy cartoon characters are actually quite cool and wait for the results. Mentally challenged animals with their limbs chopped off, impaled ad nausea, their heads rolling around garnished with blood splattering all over - wheew, isn't that just great? Bloody mess and violence galore without any substance - that's what this show is all about. <br /><br />I guess all the fans who enjoy watching this crap are also into snuff flicks and consider the complete collections of the Al Qaeda hostage beheadings in full length a must.
