This well known movie could produce a p*nese overdose. <br /><br />The main concept is fair but somehow distorted with bad taste. <br /><br />Anyway some scenes will fit perfectly in any film anthology.<br /><br />The plot is simplistic, the porn is too raw, and the parody is weak. <br /><br />The ridiculous subreal ambient created is the most hilarious thing in the movie.<br /><br />The movie is creative in some ways, indeed, and has an artisctical and conceptual value, but the average is mediocre for me.<br /><br />If yo are looking for something sexy, do not look this movie <br /><br />(I wonder if sexiness could be found in any porn movie).
