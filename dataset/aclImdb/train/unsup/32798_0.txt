While not totally awful, it's certainly a very far cry from being a good Stooge comedy. And that's really too bad because despite the fact that Joe Besser refused to take any of the traditional pokes and slaps that Moe used to hand out to Curly and Shemp, he was otherwise a fine comedian. Check him out in Abbott & Costello's "Africa Screams" where Joe actually has some screen time with Shemp. At this time Colombia Pictures was obviously trying to "wind up" the Stooges contract so the writing and direction are just not there for them. A sad commentary on the state of affairs for the comics at this time in the late 1950's. If you have absolutely nothing else to do, then do watch this short and you'll see automatically how things had declined for this type of comedy during the "cold war" rock and roll era of the late 50's.
