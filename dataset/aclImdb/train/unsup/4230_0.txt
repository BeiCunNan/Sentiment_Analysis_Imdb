This is a really neat episode, but it has an annoying lack of answers atypical of the X-Files. For example, what about all the things Shannon says have happened to her? Is it all completely made up? And if so, why? If it is true, why don't they show an investigation into it or something? Finding THAT evidence would have made for a pretty powerful sequence. And the agents clearly couldn't just ignore it all, they would have to look into it at some point, and the episode ends so early that we don't get to see what they find out. I get the sense that they might have run out of time while making this episode and had to cut things out, since a lot of plot threads are abandoned. And aside from this episode, the X-Files normally seems to cater to the curious type of audience that wants to actually find out what's going on. It is an investigation show after all. I wish this was a "to be continued" episode, because as much as I hate those, this is an interesting story and they could have gone a lot deeper into it.
