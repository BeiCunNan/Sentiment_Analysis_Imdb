If cinematography and period settings were not present, this film wouldn't be able to get any attention. Why? OK, here I go. First thing, above all others, is that when anybody attempts to make a popcorn flick outside of the States, the product will fail, for sure. <br /><br />Second, the idea is good, but the rendering of it came out pretty lame with the thankful exceptions of a few shots, especially when Leo (the younger Jaquou) is present. But, all in all, it's a very predictable, un-original and so-so film.<br /><br />Third, it's an action film so full of clich√©s that, with a grain of imagination, it turns out to be as dull as a Big Mac.<br /><br />French films, when they're true to their origin, are usually reflective, deep, difficult, full of drama and demanding for most audiences. But, in this particular occasion, joining some other flops, enormous amounts of money went down the drain -literally, if you've already seen this film.<br /><br />Olivier Gourmet, one of the most talented actors in France, could make some people, like me, watch this film. Please, if you like Olivier's previous work, don't. He's, to say the least, sketchy.
