I like Hudson Leick as much as the next guy (and probably more than most of the next guys), but even for her, this movie is just not worth watching. It's just plain terrible from start to finish. Sure, Hudson looks great if that's your interest -- not hard for her to look good in any case -- but even fast-forwarding and just watching her scenes, this one is just a real crapper. Even if you really like Hudson, avoid it.
