Awful awful awful.<br /><br />I kept wondering if this movie wasn't made in 1928, not 1958.<br /><br />War of the Worlds was made in 1953 and is like Star Wars compared to this movie.<br /><br />I could make this movie in my backyard with a camcorder and a $1000 budget. Okay, maybe not.<br /><br />Sound editing was crappy, special effects (if you can call them that) were bad, acting was pretty bland. The storyline was bad.<br /><br />The costumes were okay, that's about it.<br /><br />I saw it on Turner Classic Movies, but I still want my money back.
