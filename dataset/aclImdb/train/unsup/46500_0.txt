Awful TV show. Cheap cheesy effects and the dumbest most repetitive plots in all of TVdom. Can't hold a candle to any of the movie versions all of which are far, far better. Perhaps the only draw of this show is the fact that in the first season it featured a little bit of nudity. Nice gimmick, didn't ABC do that years ago?
