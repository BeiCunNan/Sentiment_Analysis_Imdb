Humans have fled the evil force that now rules the known galaxy, yet some living in a neo-primitive society (a hybrid of Conan the Barbarian and power rangers) fight back.<br /><br />There is just no way for this harmless summary to convey the wild mediocrity of this film. Comparing it to even the worst heroic-fantasy has to offer doesn't do it justice, because while those films are merely poor, this film's badness is extreme. Not content on featuring a ludicrously complicated plot, "Turkish Star Wars" boasts action scenes and characters that would make the worst Power Rangers/Xenia hybrid you could imagine look like Lord of the Rings. This is before you even consider the petrifying inclusion of shots stolen from Star Wars (particularly one shot of a TIE fighter exploding before the FAlcon, which reappears at least 10 times in the film) in the wrong aspect ratio and the shocking inclusion of music from Indiana Jones.<br /><br />Yet this film is a marvel because you'll be spellbound, either horrified and unable to move or laughing yourself into a coma. Subtitles are hardly necessary, because as a visual feast of ludicrousness, the film delivers. But see it translated and you're in for one hell of a headache...<br /><br />What makes this film a cult classic is that you can't overcome that sneaking suspicion that the makers were doing this intentionally. If so, they are geniuses to rival Kubrick.
