I got this DVD and hoped it might entertain me on an average level and that my friends would love it. I think I realized from the start this was a sex monster plot and designed to attack the wankie teen audience. It is the male aged 10-15 I think must be the top raters of this rather sad attempt at cinema.<br /><br />What did I like? Well, the fight between the female Medusa aliens was cool. The sex and more sex scenes very low rated. Perhaps a 50 year old man has as his fantasy being raped by an aggressive female monster, but Somehow this just left me cold.<br /><br />The plot was cheese and full of holes. The acting was so bad, I could have thought I deserve an Academy now.<br /><br />But, I being a sci-fi buff of sorts, had to keep wondering, after the lab burns, how many more of those things are out there.<br /><br />Having some mercy on their audience, they didn't pan to a million other morphing monsters, just ready to breed.<br /><br />We can rest assured they are dead, until the next grade D sci-fi- clone of Species is produced.
