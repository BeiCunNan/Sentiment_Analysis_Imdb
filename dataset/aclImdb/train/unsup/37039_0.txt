After watching "Memento", the Hollywood original, i was expecting a good remake of the same with an added Indian masala pinch from Ghajini.<br /><br />The film started off well but lost its touch after fifteen minutes as itloses its way gradually and one can expect only the worse as the movie progresses. The love story plot in the movie Drags a lot. I did not understand the need for such an exaggerated and a gruesome monotonous plot of romance. The director did not even care about the lag as his art of storuy telling sucks. The climax scene was the worst i have seen i my entire life. It had nothing to do with the story. I had gone to see this movie with ten friends and all of them hated the movie to the core. The Performances: 1. Asin did acommendable job and so did the other actress. 2. Surya tries too much and too hard only to fall short of even a decent performance. i would recommend kakka Kakka instead of this movie. 3. Only Pratap Rawat was the saving grace of what can be duly called a FLOP SHOW To conclude i must say -> that this film would be loved only by ardent Surya fans and those who really don't care to bother much about the Movie as Mr. Murgadoss had deviated from the path completely. SO the movie in my opinion is a big NO. Lets see what AAmir Khan would do when he does the remake. so, Mr. Murgadoss, i would suggest that you take up manual for directing movies as your last two ones -Ghajini and Stalin were juz AWFUL.
