This film is a surprise from many points of view - the greatest is that the cast is virtually all over 65 as am I. I was appalled to see how most of them have aged. Especially Cannon who seems to be plastic surgeon-ed out of her face - but that is beside the point. They all do a good acting job and I still - the next day - feel quite a bit about the film, as you can see. It is worth the price and the story line is not bad at all but there are a few empty spots without explanation, which might have been avoided. There is a little silliness - but that's OK. Growing old, as they say, is not for sissies and this film shows how much effort goes into just keeping a simple romantic relationship aflame after a certain age. I liked the film but did not love it. I did love the age of the actors. More, please.
