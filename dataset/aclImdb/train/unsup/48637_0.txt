I thought this might be funny going in, and Taye Diggs got a few laughs out of me, but I will never understand this whole "act black" thing. First off, I am black- I don't act like that. I speak well and I don't do hip hop and I'm not into rap. To shock you further, I'm also in my mid-twenties. However, so many people believe that all black folks are like that, and there are a lot of "posers" out there who try to act that way. It's not "acting black." It's "acting poor." Because that's how poor folks in the ghetto act, black, white, green, whoever. The trailer park folks aren't too far off, the accent's a little different and the lingo is a bit different. But riddle me this: go to the 'hood, and go to the trailer park, and write a list of things you'll see in common that have nothing to do with skin color: i.e. the Lexus outside the shotgun house vs. the Viper outside the trailer. And about the movie...well, it's kinda like hanging with Mary Jane, you lose a few brain cells, and forget the entire experience. King Kong definitely got something on this one.
