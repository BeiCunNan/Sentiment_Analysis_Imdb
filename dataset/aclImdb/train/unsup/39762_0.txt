and I don't mean the sulfur coming up through the vents.<br /><br />The plot is as thin as the earth's crust after these dweebs drilled. Any death in this movie is deserved due to the bad acting.<br /><br />The CG effects look cheap and cartoonish, the lame tie-in and obvious shot at the anti-terror task forces are ridiculous.<br /><br />Other than the fact that the city of New York is facing total destruction, I found little of any redeeming value is this laugher.<br /><br />Michael Ironside must really be desperate for money. The dude from Galactica needs to rethink his career choices after being pitched as an overzealous government type.
