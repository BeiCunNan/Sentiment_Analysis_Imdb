first of all, i would like to give this a minus rating but they only allow me a 1 as the lowest.<br /><br />werewolf costume is very bad. they had to hide it with a foggy camera work.<br /><br />the acting is not so good. got even worse near the end when they are attacked by the wolf. did i say the wolf look terrible. the costume at your Halloween local store is probably way better.<br /><br />you only see the wolf a few times in foggy lens. no transformation scenes at all.<br /><br />i want my rental money refund. wait, i got it for free. OK, i want my hour and a half back.<br /><br />uurrrgggggg. this video suck big time. i cant believe i didn't go with an American werewolf in Paris. that is way good. the only reason i went with this trash is because i have seen the werewolf in Paris already.<br /><br />did i mention that this video is terrible and horrible. aaaaarrrrggggg.
