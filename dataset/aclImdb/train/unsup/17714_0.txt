I discovered this film recently on French TV under the title "Les Rescap√©s du Pacifique". It's quite a long affair, around three hours. The most striking thing is the sets used. Beautiful, unspoiled beaches, palm trees, clear turquoise seas obviously photographed through polarizing filters, clear deep blue skies, it makes one think of Polynesia though nothing in the credits gives any indication as to the whereabouts. I had never heard of any of the actors involved and on checking IMDb find that they are all Australian, therefore little known on this side of the planet. The plot line was watcheable but there were several plot holes and one gets the impression that the protagonists were more intent on staying on the island than actually trying to get away from it. They all seem as well extremely well dressed, clean, and well nourished, all of which seems a little exaggerated given that they were living in primitive conditions on an island. A certain number of people are killed during the course of the film, which gives a rather black tone to it, and to be fair, this contrasts alarmingly with the gorgeous exotic sets. Certainly worth viewing for the visual pleasure it exudes, the film is nevertheless less interesting on a plot basis, though the soundtrack is not unpleasant either.
