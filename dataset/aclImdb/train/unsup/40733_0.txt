You read the summary? Yes? Then there is no need to say anything else about this movie.You got to see it yourself to believe how bad it is.<br /><br />The story is a idiotic piece of sh*t with an absolutely silly message. The acting is wooden as hell. The creatures are as frightening as the Muppet's and the action is lame. The make-up department doesn't even reach work seen in Star Trek: Next Genration. The Crew doesn't seem to be very skilled at all. Uwe Boll is a directing genius in comparison to Tomoo Haraguchi. But I have to admit that the editing work is acceptable.<br /><br />This picture isn't even worth to be called trash. It's just a big waste of time.
