I thought TBB was a good movie, not what I expected though. Overall I think it deserves the 7 out of 10.<br /><br />My 'problem' with the movie is that they sometimes tried to hard to make the plot mysterious and twisting and turning. I also get the impression that there are too many ideas in the screenplay, good ideas though but i think they overdid it near the end. <br /><br />Also the con in the story wasn't always that credible - as far as con films are very credible - The con(plot) was too self-evident to really amaze me at times... Like Stephen could really predict every single move.<br /><br />Still it was a good plot and a good movie in general. Good characters, good actors, not the corny end I feared but not the end I hoped to see though.<br /><br />In the end I do advise you to go see it for yourself and make up your own mind, it's certainly not a waste of time or money.
