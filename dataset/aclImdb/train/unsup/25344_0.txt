This movie when i saw it kept me into it the whole way through. This movie had everything a true horror movie should a good story line, and great gore scenes. the ghosts in this movie were done up well and the way Lou diamond Phillips played his role as the ghosts son worked well throughout the movie. To anyone who hasn't seen this movie I would suggest watching it if you can find it. I give this movie a 8 out of 10
