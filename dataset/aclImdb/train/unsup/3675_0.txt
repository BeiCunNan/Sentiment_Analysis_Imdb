Experimental cinema at its best. This is by far one of the freshest Mexican features in recent years. The film is also a very personal journey for Jonas Cuaron. Even though the film might scare some people because it is composed of only pictures and dialog. A coming of age film, that reveals itself photo after photo, and a very funny approach to the Mexican and American cultures. Always charming, almost improvised, the voices are top notch, weird and sometimes distracting, but very intimate indeed. Few flaws in here, more than a movie, it's an experience. I had personally only seen this format previously used by Chris Marker. A very good debut film by Jonas, with only $8,000 dollars as its budget.<br /><br />9/10 Carlos Reyes, Cine Azteca
