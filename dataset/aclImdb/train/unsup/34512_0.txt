I paid to see this dog in an actual movie theater...I can't imagine how boring my life must have been then to not have any better alternative--say, root canal work on four teeth at once without Novocaine.<br /><br />Julius was my hoops hero at the time (still is in some ways), and I was major-league embarrassed for him.<br /><br />The premise is ridiculous, and the movie takes itself so seriously it just strains all credulity. If it were a little bit more "camp" in style, it might be funny to watch 20 years later, but it just doesn't get how ludicrous it is. Even the hoops highlights are mediocre.<br /><br />We called it, "The fish that ate our $3.50 (which was movie admission at the time!)."
