The writer of this film needs to instead, write fairy tales. This was a nice long 101-minute waste of my time, a waste of the crew's time, a waste of my own money, and a waste of space on the shelves at Blockbuster. If I could rate this a zero, for worthless waste, I would. This was by-far the dumbest movie I've ever seen. This was worse than "Friday the 13th".<br /><br />The acting was pretty decent, I must say. You had to be a good actor not to laugh and show frustration in a movie like this one. So you have... a crew of whatevers going to Alaska to investigate some oil issue/some gas coming up from the ground, and the movie spends over an hour focusing on that. Then, they start dying one-by-one, primarily by suicide. ...Um? I guess it's the gas, if there is any. That's my best bet, but it was unclear.<br /><br />Ending, you have these ghost-like figures that only a selected few could see, and of course these figures weren't friendly. ...Where the hell did the figures come in? What does that have ANYTHING to do with ANYTHING? I took this film, smashed the disk, and destroyed the case. It angers me that stupidity like this is allowed in the film business.
