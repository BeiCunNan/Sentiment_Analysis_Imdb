I remember playing this game at a friend. Watched him play a bit solo until we decided to try play 2 and 2, which we found out how to do. I thought it was extremely fun, especially as we had to sit next to each other (I didn't have Internet nor the knowledge of LAN by then). A few weeks later I bought the game and played like a mad man.<br /><br />During the time I've spent playing this game I can honestly say that it's a great game for fantasy and strategy lovers. It evolves around a very cool and handy system where it's very easy to get accompanied by people in younger ages due to the very basic system of the game, which is actually great.<br /><br />The storyline was somewhat complex for me, but others might have the experience to understand it. But the gaming experience was awesome. Heroes is probably the first game which contains a system in strategy you might not have seen before. The graphics are very nice. And the scenes of each city are just b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l. Accompanied by a great musical composition.<br /><br />It's a game worth trying out. Whether you're 10 years old or in your thirties, and/or over.
