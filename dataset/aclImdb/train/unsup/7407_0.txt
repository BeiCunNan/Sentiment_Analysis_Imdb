OK so it didn't top No Holds Barred, but it was still fun to watch. The Hulkster plays Shep Ramsey, an outer space warrior who is forced to vacation on Earth. Christopher Lloyd supplies all the laughs as a stressed out business man, but his life really turns upside down when Ramsey rents out the apartment his wife offered.<br /><br />Not Hulks best, but not his worst either.
