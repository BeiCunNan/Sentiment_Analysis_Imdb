I was very moved and impressed by Keane, it is the kind of movie that you just can't shake, it keeps coming back into your mind. Lodge Kerrigan has created a very special film and Damian Lewis is brilliant as the title character. He is on screen every minute of the film and we learn about the life of William Keane in a simple and realistic manner. You feel great empathy for this man as he struggles to find his lost child lost in the urban jungle and make sense out of his confusing and challenging world. The movie is heartbreaking and hopeful but yet unpretentious and simply told. I just read that the film will be released soon, if you get a chance - see this movie!
