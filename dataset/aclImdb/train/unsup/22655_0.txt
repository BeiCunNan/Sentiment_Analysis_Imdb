Giant clichéd characters try to teach us morals as they go through shocking events. This movie is gaudy and fake. If I have to watch one more movie where a girl sleeps with the wrong guy and declares all men are (insert derogatory animal reference here,) I am going to puke. It seems that everyone in this production knows how stupid these girls are, so they are displaying it in the writing and in the acting. This movie is trying to hard to appeal to all those girls in the audience that feel this way. I wasn't touched watching Shallow Hal, in fact as an overweight person I was just plain disgusted, so don't relate to this movie. I don't want a movie to think it is smarter than me and try to prove it to me, it should simply be smarter. Thora Birch and Dominique Swain deserved better than this. Thora Birch is the only one who seems to have their head right in this movie. Her part is underwritten and yet another cliché, but she is so crazy that it doesn't matter. As for Busy Phillips, she made me laugh like a little boy during her "we have to do this, for all woman" speech. This movie may have worked as a black comedy with all of the cardboard characters, but Dominique Swain's part wouldn't fit in that movie. The last scene is the apex of stupidity with the slutty Busy saving the sweet Dominique in a ridiculously filmed and wrongfully acted climax to the film.
