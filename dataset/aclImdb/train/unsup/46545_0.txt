This movie is a giant step backward from the 80s Umrao Jaan. Granted dancing is good as should be expected of Aishwarya Rai but her character comes off as flat, weak and unlikable. The brothel is an idealized fantasy place where she can remain loyal to her true love all the while crying her eyes out because life's so unfair. I thought the movie was extremely dull and boring and I suspect Mrs Rai was crying to some extent because she got trapped in this awful movie by JP Dutta.<br /><br />Spoiler: Worst scene: the rape and aftermath. Only: there is no aftermath as the lady is in a really forgiving mood. Everyone does make mistakes I guess (like watching this movie!). The whole love story also doesn't work for me. While in the original Rekha came across as this intelligent woman, Aishwarya Rai is just a pretty face and of course her Nawab falls in love with her at first sight. She is just another pretty face...
