As a rule, I don't like making comments about films that I don't really like. But occasionally, I'll make an exception. Actually, I can't say I dislike this film so much as that I was disappointed by it because with the cast, I expected a better movie. I'd read the book and enjoyed it and looked forward to the movie. The sad truth is, apart from one or two performances, there really isn't much to this harmless bit of fluff. By the bye, it is a titillation flick, like it or not.
