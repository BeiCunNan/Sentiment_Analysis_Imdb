I think all women under 40 should see this movie.Thumbs up for the women director's vision on the issues depicted in this movie.Uma Thurman is absolutely gorgeous,very talented,very subtle.All actors are great.This is what women should mostly watch,not soap operas,Pretty Woman,Titanic and other crap.If all movies, TV and music would follow the same pattern of this movie (and other), as opposed to unrealistic,cheesy crap that you usually find,the world would be a better place, for both men and women. The scene in the end where Uma's character makes a spectacle of herself in the pub is right there with Pacino's "say hello to my little friend!".Beautiful.Realistic.Interesting.Shattering.<br /><br />I am speechless, 10 points.
