Really enjoyed this film. Well structured and pretty unique telling of a good thought provoking story.<br /><br />We tried to work out what was happening and must admit to failing miserably up until the last ten minutes. In its own way the film was actually pretty pacey and I think it worked better being only some 90 minutes long. It might have dragged a little being any longer. Thought all of the characters were good and added to the overall mood of the film.<br /><br />The story may well be not as original as we thought it was but it kept our interest with all the various twists. It relied upon the plot, script and acting to keep it going and all in all it worked very well.<br /><br />We saw it on a recommendation and would likewise recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />
