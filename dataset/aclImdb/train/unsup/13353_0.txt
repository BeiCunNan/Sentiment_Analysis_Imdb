I'm a big fan of David F. Friedman, with titles such as "Space-Thing", "The Defilers", and especially the H.G. Lewis pictures ranking high on my list of cult favorites. I can't get enough of his special kind of colorful camp. Unfortunately, "She-Freak" is one of his weakest pictures. This maybe because it lacks the two things that Friedman used to sell his other pictures - sex or violence. For a Friedman flick, this is extremely tame. Maybe he should be applauded for attempting to craft a legitimate picture, but outside of the lack of those exploitable elements, there seems to be little effort to make something quality or compelling. David, I love you, but what were you thinking? <br /><br />To be honest, there is a few cool aspects about the film. As usual with Friedman productions, the garish color truly resembles a good vintage comic book. Also, the two lead actresses are quite attractive and there is an accurate carnival atmosphere. Thats about it though. Too much of the running time is compromised of talk, and while these bits of campy dialog are entertaining in similar films, the lack of shocking elements to space them out makes them quite monotonous after a while. Also, the film copies "Freaks" by having the horror elements confined to the last ten minutes or so, only problem is this time around the first seventy aren't even remotely compelling. "She-Freak" is a considerable disappointment. It has its merits, but not enough of them. (3/10)
