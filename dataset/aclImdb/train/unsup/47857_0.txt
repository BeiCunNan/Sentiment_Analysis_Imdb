The first time I saw this on Comedy Central, about a year ago, I thought it was incredibly funny. Lampanelli does have a gift for spouting out crass opinions in a deadpan style that keeps building one shock on top of another until you can't help laughing. I felt much like those in the film's audience appear, initially wanting to be offended and superior, eventually guffawing against my will.<br /><br />The show wasn't nearly as amusing the second time around, both because the shock of hearing uncensored bigotry on cable was gone and because of something my friend noted at the end of the first viewing: Lampanelli says that it's fun for us all to make fun of ourselves... but you'll notice she really only makes fun of minorities. Very little time is spent dissing white people -- I recall a few minutes about p.c. soccer moms and racist old white guys, the latter being just another excuse for black jokes. But, really, how could she insult whites to the same extent as blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Arabs or gays? There simply aren't equivalent stereotypes, evincing the same contempt and desire to wound, for Euro-Americans. The best she can do is to make fun of her sexually-motivated preference for dating black guys, which itself becomes an indirect degradation of black men and their supposed sexual assets.<br /><br />It's problematic.
