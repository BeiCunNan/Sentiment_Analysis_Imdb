Why they did it was totally a dark artea for me but one of the most popular things in Hollywood were making Americanised versions from French comedies. The basic problem is that the original ones were mediocre comedies you will give two stars and a half, so you can imagine the American result... "Pure luck" is the "adaption" of "Le ch√®vre", a French comedy starring Pierre Richard and Gerard Depardieu. For the "new" version they found Martin Short and Danny Glover who will always be linked with his Lethal Weapon-roles. Everything starts when Valerie (Sheila Kelley), a daughter from a rich industrial, decides to go on holiday herself and as she is the typical dumb blonde who is born for bad luck, she soon get kidnapped. The kidnappers don't know what to do with her as she doesn't even remember her own name (it'd be better they'd dump her immediately so this movie wasn't made). After several searches tons of detectives haven't found a trace till some psychologist comes up with the idea to hire Eugene (Martin Short), a man who is born for bad luck as well as the theory says that through this way they will find Valerie, but as Eugene is dumb as dumb can be he got the help of a real professional Raymond (Danny Glover). Well the biggest problem is that the goal of this film is Martin Short doing slapstickgags and after 5 minutes you know when you see a staircase he will fell or when a door is closed he will bump into it. And it goes on and on, till the moment it really is embarrassing (see the moment when he is stick by a bee and his body swells...). Funny, no it isn't....and there is no magic between Glover and Short, and for some reasons it was a bit too much like Three Amigos which was a least tenthousand times more funnier!
