Takeshi Kitano strikes with a masterpiece. What starts as typical yakuza flick sees Kitano and co. taking a trip to Okinawa to help out some friends, however these friends don't need any help, and Kitano's group of slackers and newbies accidently complicate the entire situation, forcing the crew to hideout at a little house where they enjoy their vacation until everything erupts and Kitano shows off his Harvey Kietel style.
