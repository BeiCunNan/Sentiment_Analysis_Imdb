This could have been OK but Cuba Gooding's portrayal of the overly earnest shrink ruined it.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins is interesting as a primatologist who lived with gorillas for a couple of years and then was sent to prison for killing poachers. Gooding visits him in prison to try to find out what happened even though it's none of his business. Gooding portrays the shrink as a noble man fighting the good fight against the neaderthal prison guards and warden. It's so heavy-handed it makes you sick.<br /><br />Way too much sitting around and talking in this flick. Movie should have been about Hopkin's life with the gorillas, not the boring prison meetings with the shrink.<br /><br />Ending is pathetic. Hopkins just removes a window in front of everybody and walks away and they never find him!
