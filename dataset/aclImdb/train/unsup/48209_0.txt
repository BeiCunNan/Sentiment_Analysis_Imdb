I bought a 4 DVD set of "Great Novels" through Amazon - and this 1933 version of OLIVER TWIST was included. It's a truly awful movie - risible in execution, and not in any way memorable - except for it's bad acting etc.....but it appeared to start a trend in Hollywood at the time for cheap Dickens rip-offs. Has to be seen to be believed! But the box did contain a quite good copy of BECKY SHARP which will be remembered as the first feature in 3-strip Technicolor. It stands the test of time really well.....also in the box (by mistake) was a copy of Hitchcock's SABOTAGE which might not be one of this best, but is worth watching for it's atmosphere of London at that time (1936).
