The film humanizes the gay marriage debate, focusing not only on the emotional impact of marriage for individual same-sex couples, but also the under-dog fight faced by local legislators and those in political action committees who have devoted their lives to the issue. Framing same-sex marriage as the next great civil rights challenge, Saving Marriage navigates the long, complicated political and legislative process with a human context, giving a face to a topic that is often eschewed as empty political rhetoric. If the film doesn't convince you of the justness of its cause, it at least offers a means to understand the issues and measure what is at stake for gay couples who seek the rights and validation offered by legally sanctioned marriage.
