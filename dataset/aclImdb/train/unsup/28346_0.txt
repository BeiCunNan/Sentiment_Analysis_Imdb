I really enjoyed this film. The acting was great and Zac Efron did some really nice work.I was drawn to this film because I ride horses and like racing. I didn't know much about Steeplechase before this movie. It is cool...looks pretty hard and a little dangerous but fun. <br /><br />I also enjoyed Houston Jones character and his relationship with Zac's character, "Patrick". It reminded me of my relationship with my granddad.The parents were good too, and the girl that plays Jill, is hot! My mother liked the film too, and said she would recommend it to her friends to buy for their kids because its a family movie that she enjoyed watching with me. There are some surprises in it that I won't tell you. Randy's character is a good bad guy. I think you will like it as much as I did!
