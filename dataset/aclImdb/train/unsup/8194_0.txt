Mallrats is one of those films that very few saw in a movie theatre, but went on to become a cult favorite thanks to the home video market. It boasts a "hot, young" director and a cast of likeable characters that like to cuss a lot. Add a hip soundtrack, and you've got the complete package. For those of you 21 and older, go to the View Askew website and check out the "Mallrats Drinking Game". It makes for a good night with friends.
