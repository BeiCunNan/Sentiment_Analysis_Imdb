Me and a mate were going to watch Black Hawk Down - sold out. So we decided to go and watch this film. I had NO idea what this film was about. I read no reviews, saw no trailers, none of my mates have seen it, but the poster kinda (just a bit!!) gives away the genre - horror!!! But I went in as cold as a turkey!!<br /><br />O.k. we went in and from the opening sequence to the final reel, this one delivered on many levels!! It's a very surprisingly good film!!<br /><br />As I said, I had no idea what this film would be like - my first shock was with the opening Voice-Over - it was a Liverpudlian accent! "What??!!" I thought, "this CAN'T be a British film!! British HORROR??!!" Sure enough, it was, and a damn good one too!<br /><br />I like my horror films, I really do, and I'm not scared that easily, and I have a strong stomach, so as I was sitting with a very open mind, this film scared the hell outta me!!! It made me jump more than 12 times!! a sign of a good horror.<br /><br />We've all tried it - the quija board. After watching this film, you'll be glad you locked the doors to the spiritual world!!!<br /><br />The actual seance scene is disturbing. It was very well conceived and my own personal flashbacks came back to haunt me - NEVER EVER AGAIN!!!<br /><br />This film delivers enough shocks to keep you on the edge of your seat for a while. But, it does drag in the middle, and this spoils the pace of the film.<br /><br />This being a horror, the deaths must be unique, we've seen Scream, Urban Legend etc, we want people to die in new gruesome ways - look somewhere else. This film does not absolutely lend itself to that style. Death is mainly through excessive burning. The evil spirit is a fire demon or something like that!<br /><br />PLOT SPOILERS IN NEXT PARAGRAPH!!!!!<br /><br />The plot is credible, and for once, an ending that I LOVED!!! Oh yes, it takes a lot of guts to end a film like this, and I enjoyed the ending only because it ISN'T a Hollywood ending!! Oh I love it when the bad guys win!!!!<br /><br />And on that note I shall complete my review with -<br /><br />"Now listen kids...DON'T do the quija board - it's just not healthy! Go and watch a film about a bunch of people doing it, and you'll see what I mean!"<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />Have fun and sleep tight!!!
