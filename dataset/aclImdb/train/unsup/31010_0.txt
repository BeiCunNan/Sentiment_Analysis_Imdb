This is by far one of the worst "comedies" ever made. It's disgusting. I couldn't watch more than fifteen minutes. It was as if you paid to literally see excrement in a toilet.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure there wasn't a script involved. The "writers" probably took copies of all of their movies' scripts and scribbled in between line breaks their own ideas of "hilarious" jokes.<br /><br />As for the "jokes" per say, they're everything but funny. Who the hell came up with a humping cat? Why make hooker jokes with a kid? What does "Lord of the Rings" have to do with romantic comedies?<br /><br />Here comes a spoiler you must read, to spare yourself of the torture: Referencing the line from "Meet the Parents" "I once milked a cat", the father in law says "can you milk these?" and shows him his eight nipples. The horror, the horror!<br /><br />There were actually dramatic scenes throughout that had some room for puns, or any other joke. And they just added stupid pop-culture references. Who gives a damn about Michael Jackson?<br /><br />Just for the record, the awful scene with the cat taking a crap could have been at least watchable if it hadn't lasted it's full 10 minutes.<br /><br />Alyson Hannigan can actually act very well in the dramatic parts. The actors are not actually bad, they just made terrible career decisions when saying yes to this piece of crap movie.<br /><br />Damn you, Seltzer and Friedberg. You're hacks! You're inhuman! You're not directors nor screenwriters, nor human beings! You're not even monkeys! Monkeys make fun of you! You're not even trash! Trash is smarter and kinder to audiences!
