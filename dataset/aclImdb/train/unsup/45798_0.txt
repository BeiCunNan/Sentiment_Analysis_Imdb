OMG! I have been a fan of the highlander franchise since the original movie came out, and this movie is blasphemy! Besides listing all the things that were wrong with this movie, I will attempt to list the things I liked..... NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie is virtually unwatchable! Without reservation this movie goes into my top 5 list of all time worst movies! (And to be honest I am having difficulty thinking of something that was worse off the top of my head)I always liked Adrian Paul , but how on earth did this film ever see the light of day? the story, the cinematography, the acting, the dialogue, even the special effects,it was all trash. NEVER EVER RENT THIS MOVIE! I Wouldn't own a copy if they gave it to me for free plus paid me to keep it, honestly it is that bad!
