When I review these very early films, I cut some of them a lot of slack because of when they were made. Really modern looking films with plots, decent acting and good camera-work were still just a couple years off when this film was made. The norm was a one to two minute film featuring a very mundane topic such as babies smiling, someone nailing a nail or a lady cooking. So, when this film features a prankster nailing two ladies' dresses to a fence, it is an absolute laugh riot FOR THAT TIME PERIOD. If made just a few years later, the film would have surely merited a 3 or 4. But it still is a mildly funny and watchable short.
