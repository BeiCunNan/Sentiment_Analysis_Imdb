Sorry, but mummy's aren't scary. Especially badly-made ones that wander around with flashlights in their chests. This is one of those films where you wonder why you don't stop watching; you know it's not going to get any better. But, after you've invested the time to start watching it, well...who wants to let that go to waste. Here's a tip for you; if you get the idea you're watching a bad movie, you probably are. Get up and walk away. You only have so many minutes in your life; don't let movies like "Time Waster" devour any of them.
