Quel maledetto treno blindato (aka Inglorious Bastards) has risen from the ranks of the rest of the obscure Italian made, American acted cheapies first of all because of Quentin Tarantino's reverence for the film and the fact that he plans to a remake of sorts under the same title; second of all even though Tarantino's word is enough PR to get any obscure film to raise from the depths of the unknown into popular culture, it wouldn't work if the film wasn't any good. No problem there because this film is superb.<br /><br />A group of soldiers are rounded up in a truck to be court-martialled. On the way to their destination, a German fighter jet opens fire on the Americans. Five soldiers get out and make a run for it. Now as fugitives they are on the run from both the Americans and the Germans as they battle their way to the Swiss border to freedom.<br /><br />This film is a little known masterpiece that embodies the traits of a very pedestrian style war film. There is no technical war idioms which are common to the genre, the dialogue is cool and hip. This is basically the sort of war film that I would have made because unlike the typical other films in the genre, they are not really out to defend their country, only themselves. There is nothing to dislike about this film at all. Highly recommended.
