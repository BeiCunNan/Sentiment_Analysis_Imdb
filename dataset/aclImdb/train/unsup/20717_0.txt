I can't believe that I am spending additional time, other than the time it took to actually watch the film, thinking about this movie. Maybe it is the good samaritan in me that is compelling me to warn others about this movie. This is a horrible movie. The movie consists of one long series of arguments. The attempts at humor are not funny and the characters are not believable. Do not rent this movie. There, I feel better now.
