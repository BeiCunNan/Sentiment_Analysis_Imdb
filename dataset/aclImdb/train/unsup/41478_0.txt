I rented this movie because I had a coupon for a free rental. I am glad that I did not have to pay because it is not worth paying for. The acting was very stiff and the editing was bad. The story could have been handled much better and when I read the back of the box I expected a sort of Miami Vice like movie but as it turned out Miami Vice had much better acting and much better dialog. If the four letter words were removed from the script this would have been a silent movie!
