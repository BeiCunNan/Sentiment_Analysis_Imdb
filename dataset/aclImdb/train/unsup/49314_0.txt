I was very annoyed after watching this film.<br /><br />I am a huge Bruce Lee fan, and this film would've been the best film ever in my opinion if it wasn't for Bruce Lee's very unfortunate death. The original story line was that Bruce Lee's wife and daughter get kidnapped (his character's wife and daughter), and to rescue them, Bruce Lee would have to fight up a temple - which has five floors - fighting an expert on a particular martial arts form on each floor.<br /><br />However, this film is very disrespectful, because it shows real footage of Bruce Lee's funeral - including his actual dead body - just to further the plot of the story, which is the lead character (who is meant to be Bruce Lee) faking his death.<br /><br />This film would have receieved a -10/10 if it was not for Bruce Lee's excellent fight scenes at the end, so this film therefore receives a 3/10. The fight scenes at the end are 10/10 though, just a shame they did not have all the original footage until recently e.g. the knun-chuck fight Bruce Lee has.<br /><br />
