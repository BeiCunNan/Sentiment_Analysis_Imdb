This Sci-Fi original is littered with the worst stereotypes, really really BAD acting, and Ian Reed Kesler's moobs. (man-chest) Oy the moobs! His chest is actually more ample than either of the gals'. And this poor unfortunate actually appears on screen without a shirt! I hope they paid him well for this public humiliation! I knew soon after that it was time to turn the channel. <br /><br />I enjoy Brendan Gleeson in the original so much I HAD to watch this, as I almost bought it sight-unseen. I am SO glad I didn't. The problem is that every principal from the original film has been replaced by something lesser. Instead of Hector Cyr who is an intelligent character addition to the LP team, we have Struthers the Big Game Hunter and his big black hunter/attendant. I think they actually did research to include as many racial and sexual stereotypes as possible. Compared to this film, the original is Oscar-worthy. <br /><br />And then there is the bad acting. I mean these performances are awful! No one in here acts like they had a moment of training, experience, or talent. Unfortunately, John Schneider is piled in with these inept wannabes. I mean...I wanted to like this, but in spite of John Schneider's and Cloris Leachman's involvement, there is VERY little to like herein. Horrible performances, terrible direction, inadequate film quality (M4TV), the worst Scottish accent in the history of film, and the most inept CGI since Ang Lee's The Hulk (2003) the render this production completely unwatchable. It DOES, however, make me enjoy the original all the more. I'm SO glad I didn't just buy this on DVD. Ack! <br /><br />BUT...there are some good kills and if it's splatter you're after, you might actually like this. As nasty as this is, it just might find a niche with Creature Feature aficionados who also happen to be splatter fans. Giallo fans may also like this. So, there you are.<br /><br />It rates a 4.6 on the Made For Television Scale.<br /><br />It rates a 2.2/10 on the Movie Scale from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
