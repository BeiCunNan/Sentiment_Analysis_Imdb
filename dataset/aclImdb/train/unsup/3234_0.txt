This movie, while definitely not credible film making by any means(or worth ten stars), is good ol' fashioned, camp entertainment. You have a giant ape, a blonde babe whose nipple pokes out for almost the entire movie, gore, death, and destruction. What's not to like? That said, this is just an adventure movie, and it delivers what it promises: Action, romance, and a giant ape. And it's hilarious to boot! While it probably tries to be serious(well,maybe not) it just comes off as silly. And, this being a big budget Japanese release, the picture looks great while the movie is totally goofy. This is 0one of those movies that's better to find in the dubbed, Amercanized version. It just makes it sound even sillier. Definitely worth a look for all fans of silly cult cinema. Especially silly Japanese cult cinema.
