Well this movie could have been so much more. The trailers featured the emotional "I will remember you" but the movie, apparently adjusted to growing indifference to the Iraq War by many, was afraid to let you care too much. I was really disappointed to see what happened with this film. I did a little bit of extra work (was cut from the guitar scene at last minute) on this film and it never even showed in Edwardsville, Illinois (near ST. Louis) where "Denver" scenes were filmed.<br /><br />I couldn't disagree more about Rachel MacAdams character. As an actress her job is reflect reality and some of the people who turn to the military in rural small town America where often times jobs were hard to come by before the economic meltdown. Someone from Colee's background probably wouldn't talk like someone Harvard bound, coming from a broken home etc. She brilliantly portrayed someone who refused to be held down by the life she was born into, was highly inquisitive, caring, supportive. She was a beautiful person, a great character that Rachel brought life to. She wasn't intelligent, but she wasn't dumb if you can wrap your mind about that. I thought she turned in a tremendous performance that too few people saw. I also bet there were tremendous moments left on the cutting room floor. I really thought many aspects of her performance were Oscar quality.<br /><br />Oh gee and Tim Robbins isn't the first actor to have political views. He's a professional and I didn't see an overwhelming agenda in his role. He seemed to focus on telling a story about what happens to these people when they return home.<br /><br />Michael Pena continues to be an underrated talent.<br /><br />I give the George Lucas stale raspberry award for bad CGI moments to the crew for including a stupid tornado scene that looked like it came from the Buster Keaton era. They did a much better job in '39 with the Wizard of Oz! I wonder if this film will be "put back together" with the DVD.
