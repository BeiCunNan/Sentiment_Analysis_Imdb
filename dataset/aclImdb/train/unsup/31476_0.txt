Now, I'm an avid Bollywood films fan. I must say, I wanted to see this one as I heard a lot about it in media. However, boy was I wrong. Director is confused - trying to imitate the great Mugle-Azam he fails miserably. Right from the beginning the movie is a confused piece. OK, I give him to use artistic liberty but I cannot imagine king and courtesans of 16th century sing and dance "hip-hop." That was about the only thing to watch, but then the movie would be like a parody of the great Mugle-Azam (you know like what Epic Movie is!!). I'm not sure the director even looked up a book from the era to understand how to vision the period. I thought the director of Lagaan would do better. But then now I know it is the actors behind - Aamir is a perfectionist - Lagaan has to be pseudo directed. And Swades by SRK. Ash like always is best at what she is - a drama queen! She has no acting talent, I must admit Britney of Bombay! Hritik does try hard, but with nothing to work what is to do? Well I lost my $20 (to include my drink and pop-corns - the only thing that kept me awake). I suggest you keep yours on something good - this will be on DVD soon!
