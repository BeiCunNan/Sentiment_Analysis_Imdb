I have a feeling if this mediocre movie had been more successful, the makers of Predator would sue.<br /><br />So it's not an alien, but a resurrected prehistoric monster. It even goes invisible like the Predator. And it ends up being a man vs monster battle with many scenes very similar to Predator.<br /><br />A b-grade movie from a small name company, worth watching simply as an example of a badly plaguarised attempt at a real movie. Made more than 10 years after Predator, the effects are actually worse. It's funny that the video cover mentions that some of the crew who worked on Return of the Jedi and Terminator (1) did the special effects for this movie, and that makes sense considering how old and outdated those movies are.<br /><br />If you liked Predator... watch it again, rather than this tenth rate rip off. The only other reason is if you're a chick and you want to see some well built (but not really that handsome) hunk running around with his shirt off and his muscles glistening for half a movie.
