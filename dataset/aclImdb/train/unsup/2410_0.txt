Apart from all other variables this film is ruined by one thing and one thing only: Blabbermouth Mos DeF.<br /><br />My god, this is the first time I have EVER seen a fair-budget movie been wasted by something like this. For a couple of weeks now my headphone has got a nasty screek which is annoying, but it's not half as bad as the continuous blabber in the most annoying tone of voice I have ever heard. After a good fifteen minutes a was yelling to my screen to shut him up. After 30 minutes I was praying to God to keep him quiet. After 45 minutes I was about ready to jump out of my window.<br /><br />Thank God I got the sense to just press the eject button. And I think I will now play some deathmetal albums volume up to get rid of that nasty blabber echo still in my head.<br /><br />Avoid this like the plague.
