I know one reviewer of this film that had the audacity to compare director Le√≥n Klimovsky to Tarantino. Give me a break. The film jumped all over the place and switched scenes with no apparent rhyme or reason. One minute you see a love scene begin and a second later someone is running their bicycle into a car.<br /><br />This mash-up of Hindu mysticism, voodoo and zombies never had any coherent plot.<br /><br />It did have great zombie makeup. They looked dead! <br /><br />It also had Mirta Miller. A voluptuous veteran of countless Euro-horror films, she again appeared scantily clad with her breasts heaving as she fell into the clutches of the zombies for their ritual.
