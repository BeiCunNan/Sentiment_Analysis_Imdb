Van Johnson portrays a young World War II veteran who, upon joining a prominent law firm, attempts to avoid scandal stemming from his allergy to alcohol. He forms an alliance with the daughter of the firm's leader, played by Elizabeth Taylor, and their romance is light hearted and moderated with realism. Ensemble playing from the talented cast is top-drawer throughout, with excellent timing ever in evidence. A shadowy sub-plot dealing with racial prejudice (victims: Chinese) is not overdone and is necessary for developing the film's principal theme: the inherent value of performing public service. Playwright Norman Krasna, who wrote, produced and directed this understated comedic drama, keeps matters moving briskly, while allowing scenes to develop properly by emphasizing the sharp dialogue, some of which is startling with its insight. There is good acting aplenty, by the mentioned leads as well as by Leon Ames and Edgar Buchanan; but the honors must go to the veteran English stage performer, Percy Waram, whose delivery is perfection.
