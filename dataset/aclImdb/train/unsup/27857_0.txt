Wonderful movie. Just brilliant.<br /><br />Fantastic script, odd , quirky , original and hilarious.<br /><br />Great to see some movies in Wales for a change.<br /><br />I am not Welsh but always find them hilarious weird and very unique.<br /><br />Best Welsh film Zulu great acting too from Rhys Ifans, his brother and Keith Allen. Enjoye the Phil Bennett scenes, the bath scenes, the poodle scenes, the caravan scenes, the nightclub scenes, the coffin sea burial scenes, the singing scenes, the quiz questions, the car chases, the old lady buying drugs scenes, was she talking welsh or what?<br /><br />Bryn Cartwright was great too.<br /><br />Steaky steak line was great Great singing great lines great script great characters Great ending
