I didn't know what to expect but this was a really great movie. I felt the pacing was good, the lead actress was engaging and the story had some unexpected twists. It is a daring story. The lead character is a murderer and yet I felt sympathy for her. I think the credit goes to the filmmakers for constructing such an intriguing story. It's controversial enough to make the lead character a murderer and a woman, but some of the targets could definitely raise some eyebrows depending on how one feels about the justice system.<br /><br />I think if anyone gives this movie a 1 or thinks its bad is either lying or they didn't really watch it.<br /><br />I thought it was more of a drama with some thriller elements, too. But otherwise, it delivered.<br /><br />Overall- definitely worth watching.
