1992's Juice is one of many films that graced the silver screen during the "Black Filmmaker Renaissance" of the early 90s. It is also the debut film of former Spike Lee cinematographer Ernest Dickerson. Juice is the story of a group of Harlem teens that end up in a murder case. Another notable debut in this film is of the late rapper Tupac Shakur. Shakur plays Bishop, a troubled youth that is the main culprit in the murder of another young man. A lot of people don't know that, besides being a great rapper, Shakur is very gifted and actually acted before rapping. It is very evident in the entire film. In one scene in particular, he confronts Q (Omar Epps) in their high school hallway and we see the really ugly and crazed side of his character. While Shakur may have been the highlight of the film, the film itself is great. Like the films of its time, the hip hop culture is blossoming before our eyes with every frame. There is also a great supporting cast of young actors including Samuel L. Jackson when he was still known as Sam Jackson. Juice is definitely a favorite of mine and it seems like it never ages after 15 years. Scenes are still being quoted amongst my peers and has definitely lived up being a "hood classic".<br /><br />Juice - *** out of ****
