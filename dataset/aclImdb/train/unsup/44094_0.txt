Part One was very exciting and well done. It seemed to go along with the book very well (I read the original book over thirty years ago) Tonight I was excited for part two...what a disappointment!...and that's an understatement!!! As previously mentioned by my fellow writers, this movie introduced and brought back some of the things the original movie built on...like epilepsy...PH levels...the baby and the old man...the lower level being incomplete and sealing them off. They did nothing with any of that. To make matters worse they add Dr Stones wife and kid troubles...a brief love encounter...a gay man...all this for no reason and could and should have been left out of the movie entirely.<br /><br />Stick with the script...did Michael approve of this? Remakes should be better, not worse. Did we not learn anything from the remake of Rollerball?
