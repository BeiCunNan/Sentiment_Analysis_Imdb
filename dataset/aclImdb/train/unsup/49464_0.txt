This is really bad. Awful dubbing, rubbish acting, badly shot, choppily edited and generally terrible.<br /><br />I also didn't like the fact that the scummy rapist judge didn't get shot at the end and was allowed to completely get away with forcing himself on another woman! that was a sickening scene and its a fairly misogynistic film.<br /><br />However, there are 3 plus points. All of them are the foxy women. Erica (Ada Pometti) is particularly sexy and has a great but brief sex scene. Patrizia Funari has a nice backside which is shown off. And the girl who isn't listed here but plays 'Susanna' is very gorgeous.<br /><br />I shall be checking out more of their films!<br /><br />However, they were the ONLY three plus points and thats why the film gets 3 from me. 1 POINT for each sexy woman!
