I had the pleasure of seeing this picture at one the New York screenings. I was immediately interested in this film when I saw the movie trailer. The trailer promised a film that was intriguing, smart and provocative. Body/Antibody actually exceeded my expectations and delivers extraordinary twists on an age-old story. The compelling plot and the lead actors take you on a journey that brings you to a place where you are stuck in the world of a man's bizarre psychosis. Yet you find yourself empathetic and drawn to his plight. The beautiful cinematography reinforces this repulsively clean and pristine alternative universe. I applaud the filmmakers for preserving the integrity and spirit of independent cinema. Well done!
