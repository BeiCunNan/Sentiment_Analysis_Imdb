That is the one of the movies I really liked to see, it made me cry and impressed me greatly.))))))))))) I would say it is about forgiving. Main character forgives herself and her mother. :) Actually i went to this film together with my colleague on European Cinema Week in Almaty, Kazakhstan. And I saw her hiding crying). Maybe it seems to be kinda sentimental, but I like film that make me think about something after I went out of cinema hall. I really think it is film of good quality. And the fact that its Director died just one day before its release is very sad. I would like to buy it, I hope I will be able to see it with my DVD format. Best,
