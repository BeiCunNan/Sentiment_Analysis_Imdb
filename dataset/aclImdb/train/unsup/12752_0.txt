The reviewer who reveals his ignorance by decrying, "What's a selkie?" and then proceeds to place both feet in his mouth, should bother to read a bit of Irish folklore. A selkie is NOT what some suggest, a half seal, half human. A selkie is a spirit which can take the body of a seal and a woman. It is the celtic counterpart to the Greek sirens or the oceanides, river spirits, to the Japanese kawakami, the Basque Lami√±ak and others. Shapeshifters abound in folklore and this story winds around such a tale. Bored? Go watch one of those mindless teenage slice'n dice films and leave this gentle tale about a little girl's odyssey in a breathtakingly beautiful setting in a wonderful land to children of all ages. My grandfar came from County 'Derry (what the Protestants call Londenderry) in Northern Ireland near Lough Boyle and told me stories as a child that were as gentle and awesome as this. This is a fine film. Not as goofy as Waking Ned Devine, as wacky as the Purple Taxi, as wrenching as Angela's Ashes or as poignant as The Quiet Man. But, it wasn't meant to be. It is wonderful. Check it out.
