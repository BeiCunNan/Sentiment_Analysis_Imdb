I watched "Annihilator" a few months ago and although its strange and unpredictable, enough happened to make me continue watching it till the end. Its quite a good movie and a clever idea although where they got the idea from is clear to see with the dinamatard robots having red eyes just like in the classic movie "The Terminator".<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone.<br /><br />Enjoyable, rating 7/10.
