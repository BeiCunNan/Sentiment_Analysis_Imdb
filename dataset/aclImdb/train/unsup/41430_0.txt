The title is misleading. If you expect a bloody, graphic horror film with machines slicing up humans and then neatly stacking them up in cupboards, you'll be sorely disappointed. The robots merely zap and stun, firing the occasional laser toward the hapless, horny and idiotic humans. It also takes quite a while for the killing to start, because the makers of this vaguely likable crapfest thought it necessary to introduce us first to the utterly dull and unfunny humanoids. During the introduction it became very clear which ones will survive the ordeal: there are 8 young people, and 6 of them have sex. Guess which ones manage to save their lives? <br /><br />The irony about slasher films - and I guess CM can be classified as something of that nature - is that religious folk probably don't approve of them at all, yet the moral of most such films is very clear (and very Catholic): IF YOU HAVE (EXTRA-MARITAL) SEX, YOU MUST BE PUNISHED - AND DIE. It's as simple as that. Sending this strange message to the viewer must have something to do with the human need to hate those who have more or better sex (or ANY sex) than themselves. I can't see any other logical explanation.<br /><br />CM has a certain 80s charm - though by "charm" I definitely don't mean the horrendous overly blonde hair-dos or the ultra-skinny women. The soundtrack is cretinous but fun. If you liked "Killer Klowns From Outer Space", you'll probably enjoy this, too.<br /><br />The main problem with CM is the same as with most horror comedy: not funny at all, and because there's "comedy" in it, no scares whatsoever. Not even close. Dull in parts, even when the action starts.<br /><br />Bodycount: 9.
