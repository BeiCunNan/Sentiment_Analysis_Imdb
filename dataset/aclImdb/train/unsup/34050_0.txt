Rewatch, 3/10.<br /><br />It's a re-watch indeed, but I don't remember ANYTHING from when I first saw it a couple of years back on TV so I decided to re-watch it again.<br /><br />It's not a big surprise why I didn't remember it, there's NOTHING worth remembering, there's not a original joke anywhere in this movie and the cast is lame.<br /><br />FRENCH STEWART, the "stupid" alien in 3RD ROCK FROM THE SUN has the lead and well he's good in 3RD ROCK FROM THE SUN but definitely not in this one, he is not Lead-Material.<br /><br />I don't wanna spend to much time writing about this movie, I'll put it like this: Love might stink, but not as much as this movie does.
