Let me start by saying, i registered today to write my comment on Cowboy Bebop.<br /><br />I finished the series for the second time yesterday, and it made an even bigger impression on me this time.<br /><br />Simply put, this is the best series ever created in my opinion, regardless of anime, live action, or whatever. The story is exceptional work, the characters are as alive and deep as it ever gets. It is (forgive me for using this word again, but there is no other expression)exceptionally well drawn, even for an anime. The soundtrack (oh the music)has been a part of my collection for a long time now. It is just fantastic, i cannot imagine anything else, that would fit the world of Cowboy Bebop better, than the kick-ass jazz, blues, medley that dominates this brilliant list.<br /><br />All in all, nobody should miss this stuff. Im sure there are and will be dislikers, but nothing is perfect, and thats the way it should be. Me, i cried at the end, sitting on my couch completely blown away. <br /><br />SEE YOU, SPACE COWBOY, SOMEWHERE, SOMEDAY! I'm gonna carry that weight...
