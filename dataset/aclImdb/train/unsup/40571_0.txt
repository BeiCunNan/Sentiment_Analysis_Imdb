Watching this movie frankly made me angry. Not at the big evil porn companies like the filmmakers intended, but at the filmmakers themselves. All this movie does is reinforce the stereotype that anyone who looks at porn is perverse and needs to be cured.<br /><br />Looking at other people naked is a human urge that is unhealthy to suppress. This kind of urge isn't like drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, etc because this is an urge that WE WERE BORN HAVING. Attraction to the opposite sex (or same sex, whatever) is the same thing as every other human function, like breathing, sleeping, or going to the bathroom. Any doctor can tell you that this urge is healthy, and suppressing it isn't. While it is easy to get carried away every once in a while, if you have an ounce of self restraint it won't "ruin your life". The huge majority of Americans of look at porn, yet a slim slim slim minority end up having their lives destroyed.<br /><br />According to the interviews in the movie, the reason why pornography apparently "destroys families" is because whenever they get close to their spouse / loved one, they feel ashamed of their porn addiction (two people interviewed claimed that this was their problem). A shame that's probably created by the church, parents, and society in general. When society is constantly telling you that you should be ashamed of something you can't help doing, that's bound to screw you up a little. I'd guess that if it weren't for people like the two pastors in the movie, this shame would not exist, and many of these unfortunate (and don't get me wrong, they are unfortunate) people would be better off.<br /><br />Based on what I've seen in the movie, xxxchurch.com spends an overwhelming majority of its time and resources merely going around the country advertising the site and telling people that they're sick and that porn is evil. The only real thing I saw the two pastors do to help these porn addicts is provide a support group. And what does a support group do? It shows you you're not alone, thus making YOUR SHAME GO AWAY. So congratulations, I guess. You're absolving people of the shame that you directly created.<br /><br />For further proof of their outreach based on shame, look no further than the x3watch featured in the movie. Anyone that wants to can download a program that alerts an 'accountability partner' of all the porn sites they've visited in the past two weeks. When talking about potential accountability partners, they suggest the two founders of xxxchurch.com, your pastor, or your mom. Although they try to play it off as something like an AA sponsor, it really is nothing more than just a way to shame you out of looking at porn. If sending your pastor or mom an email every time you look at a dirty website isn't merely a way to shame you out of looking at porn, then what is it? Another note: if pornography didn't exist, this natural human urge wouldn't magically disappear. If anything, the unfortunate people featured in the movie would be even more confused than they are now.<br /><br />Having said all that, I have to admit that the two pastors do seem to have the best intentions. Although they're against porn, it doesn't look like they're trying to outright ban it, as many Christian groups are. And I give them credit for handing out pamphlets that promote love instead of trying to scare people with images of burning hellfire (like the group outside of the porn expo). But although their hearts are in the right place, I still have to say that they're wrong.<br /><br />I'll close in saying this: I find it extremely ironic that the pastors claim that everyone who looks at porn is only seeing "one side of the story".
