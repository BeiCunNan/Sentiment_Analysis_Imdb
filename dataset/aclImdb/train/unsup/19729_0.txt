Probably not as heartwarming and memorable as the first film ("Mickey's Once Upon A Christmas"), this one is also fun, entertaining and amusing (perhaps even more amusing than the last one)! Unfortunately the stories aren't as well-planned as they could be, with unnecessarily mean characters (even Louie, Douie and Huey are a bit meaner than usual) and unnecessary grumpiness. <br /><br />Like the last film, this has a few stories about Mickey and his friends at Yuletide. This is computer animated and also unlike the first film, has more stories. <br /><br />The first story is about Daisy and Minnie dancing on ice and both becoming cross with each other. Beautiful skating and all, but this has too harmless and aggressive a plot for a normal enjoyment, unless you are a tiny kid who thinks violence and arguing is all right, or a parent who wants their child to see what they could be like. Personal rating: 5 and a half out of ten. <br /><br />The second story has Douie, Huey and Louie going to where Santa lives to try and be on his list so they can get presents. This one is the most fast paced and exciting and not all that bad either. The CGI used in this one to portray many different things is very well done and would probably not be done nearly as well in cartoon. Huey, Douie and Louie are incredibly naughty as well, but they usually are anyway. Personal rating: 7.<br /><br />The third story is the shortest, but is surprisingly well done. Max, with his girlfriend, are going to go round to his house with Goofy and Goofy, being his goofy self, will be likely to still play the goof. The background song is entertaining and well-sung and this story is also funny, which is "refreshing". Unfortunately we mainly see Max as a grumpy teenager, which is not so refreshing. A good way to describe this: A clean glass of lovely cold water, with quite a large dob of spit added to it. Personal rating: 6. <br /><br />The fourth story is mainly about the hot chocolate-loving Donald and because of this obsession he has no cares whatsoever. This story is luckily funny and entertaining, with well-used CGI yet again. **SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD** However, the change in Donald is a wee bit too quick, lowering down the quality of this part of the film. **SPOILERS OVER**. Personal rating: 7.<br /><br />The fifth story is probably the most well-done, despite being slightly sad and depressing. Pluto knocks over all of Mickey's Christmas decorations by accident and is sent to his doghouse. Thinking that Mickey no longer loves him, Pluto runs away. A sweet and especially amusing story, the most heartwarming of the lot. Personal rating: 8.<br /><br />Recommended to Mickey Mouse fans and CGI likers. Enjoy "Mickey's Twice Upon A Christmas"! :-)
