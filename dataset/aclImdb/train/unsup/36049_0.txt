I was eager to watch Cool Money as the idea for the heist was conceived in my home town of Rochester. The robbery of the Pierre Hotel in New York City actually took place in 1972 but the film is made to look like it could have taken place in the present. It seems to me that if you are going to make a film about a historic event (the largest robbery in New York City history), then you should make the effort to create it for the correct time period. The only hint of the period was Sammy's wardrobe. I know all about creative license but even most of the scenes that supposedly took place around Rochester were wrong. There is no "Rochester Downs" race track, the Rochester Police Department is not broken down by precincts and there has never been a Rochester Examiner newspaper. Perhaps the production company would have been better off coming to Rochester to film rather than go across Lake Ontario to Toronto. In my opinion, things like this only cheapen a film. The acting was pretty good (loved Margot Kidder's portrayal of Bobby's mother) though some of the characters were rather transparent. If you're looking for a film that gives some idea of the events that lead up to the heist, then this film is fine, otherwise, don't waste your time.
