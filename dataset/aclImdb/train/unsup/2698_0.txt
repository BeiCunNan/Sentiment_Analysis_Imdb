Growing up I used to watch this show, nearly every Sunday night. I still remember trying to finish up last-minute stuff, have my shower and get ready for school the next day in time to watch "Life Goes On" (and on many occasions, "America's Funniest Home Videos" after that) Often I would be running late, and would watch "Life Goes On" in my parents bedroom, practically still dripping wet, wearing a bathrobe, with my hair wrapped up turban-style in a towel to air-dry as my dad ironed his work clothes, and I watched the show.<br /><br />I have LOVED "Life Goes On" for its entire run! It is a poignant and touching family drama, starring Bill Smitrovich and Patti LuPone as "Drew" (Smitrovich) and "Libby" (LuPone) Thatcher, a middle working-class couple, who are dealing with the issue of "mainstreaming" their 18 year old son, Charles "Corky" who has Downs Syndrome into a regular, public high school as a freshman, and all the challenges and trials, tribulations, and triumphs that go along with it.<br /><br />Drew and Libby have their hands full, raising Corky and their 2 other children, twenty-something Paige (Monique Lanier in Season 1, Tracey Needham in Season 2-4) who is Drew's child from a previous marriage, and 14 or 15 year old Rebecca "Becca" while trying to make ends meet on Drew's construction worker salary, and Libby's income as a secretary/clerical worker in an advertising agency.<br /><br />Towards the end of the first season, Drew buys a diner, and quits his back-breaking construction work to run the restaurant, and things start looking up for the Thatchers.<br /><br />Growing up I LOVED watching "Life Goes On", especially because of Kellie Martin, and Monique Lanier. Though I liked Tracey Needham, I was IMMENSELY disappointed when Monique left, and the role of Paige was recast with Tracey. Because up until then, I LOVED Paige best, and then Becca. After Monique left and Tracey assumed the role, it changed and I LOVED Becca best.<br /><br />This is a BEAUTIFUL series, and one of the many nostalgic highlights of my childhood and adolescence.<br /><br />When I think of my childhood and preteen years, I think of shows like "Punky Brewster", "Life Goes On", "Perfect Strangers", "Who's the Boss?", "Head of the Class" and many more! But "Life Goes On" (and a few very select others), had and still does have a very special place in my heart! I CAN'T WAIT until the other 3 seasons are released on DVD! BRING ON SEASONS 2, 3 & 4!!!!!!!!!
