"Candy" is, above all, a movie whose point you should not try to figure out. It's the psychedelic story of Candy Christian (Ewa Aulin), a teenage girl who constantly gets raped. That's a loose description, but probably not sufficient. The mammoth cast includes John Astin as Candy's father, Richard Burton as a Dylan Thomas-like poet, Ringo Starr as a gardener, Walter Matthau as a general, James Coburn as a surgeon, Charles Aznavour as a hunchbacked thief and Marlon Brando as a guru.<br /><br />Okay, so I didn't actually experience the 60s, so "Candy" doesn't have the same significance to me as it did to my parents' generation. But regardless of that, it's still a really fascinating movie. Weird, but the good kind of weird.
