<br /><br />I rent horror flicks all the time, the campier the better, even such stinkers like Blood Diner... but this... I think that if they had used this film on Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange, he would have gone homicidal again. Full Moon begins to crash and burn, leading to the ultimate craphole, Puppet Master Retro. The kills are so retarded, and at the end, which made me wish to commit suicide... Tank spends the whole movie carving this puppet out of wood, when he is transferred into it, there's a TV screen? And a laser? Did I miss something? And then the way he zaps the scientist... I've seen better special effects in the Power Rangers tv show. What I realized is that if you read the back of this video box, it tells you the whole story... Seriously, the whole thing. Damn you to hell for making this movie, Full Moon, and may God have mercy on your souls.
