OK, this film is sold mainly on Stone Cold Steve Austin as it's star. And it falls down on it's ass right there.<br /><br />He isn't a current wrestler and hasn't worked in the ring for at least 2 years that I am personally aware of, it's more than likely even longer than that.<br /><br />At least when Hogan did Rocky 2 and The Rock did The Mummy they actually were both working for the company. You can't believe Stone Cold as a fighter if you know anything about his injury history, especially his knees.<br /><br />The fact that you don't actually see their star until your a full 11 minutes into the actual film speaks volumes about how much they care about their on screen talent.<br /><br />The 2nd thing the film falls down on is that the fighters are told they have 30 hours to kill each other but the timer is activated before they even reach the island so the 30 hour time limit is a load of rubbish anyway.<br /><br />I think they cast Vinnie Jones in this after seeing things like Gone In 60 Seconds, Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels and the UK remake of The Mean Machine. His reputation as a hard man has long since gone.<br /><br />Watching the 'being thrown out of the helicopter' scene and "seeing" Stone Cold land hard on the sand you then know most of his hard stuff is going to be done by stunt-men.<br /><br />Another pointless WWE extra was Nathan Jones. Now this chap hasn't worked for them for a VERY long time and had a real short career anyway. He'd already worked with Jet Li and really lowered his movie profile by agreeing to be in this garbage.<br /><br />The fast camera cuts in his fight with Stone Cold were way too fast and made that scene real hard to watch. Nathan Jones was killed far too easily and too quickly and you can now see they'll be using the bomb each person is wearing on their ankle a lot as he was the 2nd one to go that way and the 3rd to die in total.<br /><br />Clearly the writers didn't have enough material to show most of the film on the island as they introduced a family as a back story for Stone Cold and took us away from the island (and the action, slowing the film right down at exactly the wrong time and place).<br /><br />Vinnie Jones rapes the Hispanic women who was there with her husband (although you see nothing, it's all implied) and then blows her up so she's #4 dead.<br /><br />Now then. With no tools, exactly HOW did Stone Cold jam his GPS signal? This film's main problem is it's copying stuff that has already been elsewhere and much better than this. Yes, you can draw parallels to The Running Man, Survivor - Series 7, Fortress, Battle Royale and even a film from the same year as this was released Doomed.<br /><br />If your going to steal someone else's movie at least try and add something creative to your own to set it above the other one? The next guy to die is one of the faceless black actors and yes, he's blown up by his bomb, so 5 are dead and we're halfway through the cast with 2 sets of alliances going (Vinne Jones & the Japanese guy, Stone Cold and the husband of the dead Hispanic woman).<br /><br />Vinnie Jones identifies himself to Stone Cold as SAS (WRONG! Current and Ex-SAS would never say they were special forces ever, their trained not to). Vinnie would have never passed SAS selection, he's too much of a character. The SAS like what they call "grey men", people who don't stand out. Him and the Japanese guy also kill the Hispanic dude and he's #6 dead.<br /><br />A black woman is the 7th to be killed (Vinnie shoots her with an arrow but she blows herself up with the bomb.) leaving Vinnie, Stone Cold and the Japanese guy left.<br /><br />What WERE the metal things Stone Cold taped to his forearms (and where the hell did he find duct tape on an island)? Again we have another fight where it's shot with too many fast cuts to make it watchable. Fast cuts DON'T equal action, they equal damn difficult to watch.<br /><br />Stone Cold kills the Japanese guy so it's just him and Vinnie left which was pretty predictable and you already know whose going to win that fight anyway.<br /><br />Whoever wrote this clearly did NO research on the SAS and what type of person they take, Vinnie's character is nothing like an SAS person would be, too much bravado and being gung ho. That might work for Hollywood but it's just not true in the real world.<br /><br />The worst goof in that sequence was Vinnie getting the "dead man's click" when the shotgun was empty. Sorry but the SAS are taught to count their rounds to avoid this and he had loaded that weapon himself so that was NEVER going to happen, OK?<br /><br />After Stone Colds "death" we are made to sit through a very preachy message about watching TV violence designed to make us think and question what we watch. WHY? What was the point of that?<br /><br />Vinnie killing most of the people in the control room was just another example that the writer didn't understand the SAS mindset at all. Oh, and the sound effects for his MP5 were totally wrong - it sounded more like a 50 calibre than a 9mm.<br /><br />The death of the guy running the whole TV show is pretty weak and the fact that Stone Cold's bomb is never deactivated seems to be glossed over and ignored.<br /><br />The super weak and lame reunion ending topped off a generally awful and weak film.<br /><br />Avoid like it's hunting you down to kill you.
