For a lot of film fanatics "?" may be the modern-day equivalent of Pulp Fiction vs. Monty Python, and a contemporary indie masterpiece. Whether or not this sort of praise is warranted, "?" is still an all-around well-made film with pitch perfect casting, exceedingly memorable and quotable dialogue, and the sort of high quality not generally seen in a directors' duo debut.<br /><br />The film tells an interlocking tale that takes place in the underbelly of our culture. Its stylistic approach turns an ordinarily low-life, underachieving college grad, a charming mentally disabled teddy bear type, and what would normally be a repulsive sex toy for many, into a highly engaging, pseudo-intellectual dark comedy experience.<br /><br />Beyond the obvious portrayals of unflinching darkly comedic behavior, rapid-fire pop cultural and profanity-laced dialogue, there's an amazing depth to its plot/story. "?" is a one of a kind wild ride for the comedic senses and dark emotions, and truly an important piece of indie cinema.
