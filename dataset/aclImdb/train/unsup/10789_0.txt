Oh my....was this a stinker.<br /><br />I tired to give it as much of a chance as possible because..you cannot believe everything you read from critics..and you cannot believe everything you hear.<br /><br />With "the Master of Disguise", you can. This was awful. I don't really think they meant it to be awful, I mean the story sounded good, I'm sure...on paper..to a bunch of film executives who were drunk at the time they heard it. Then it probably got by a bunch of other folks in various forms of development who thought, "This could really be a silly little film that would catch on". But it wasn't and didn't.<br /><br />In some other universe, I wish there was a better script to punch up the story but they relied too much on Dana's characters that were god-awful and unfunny. This movie was painful to watch -- painful to see talented people on film in a very untalented movie. Someone should have pulled the plug..ceased production for a decade..something..anything.<br /><br />But here we are. This is a major pass..under any circumstance.
