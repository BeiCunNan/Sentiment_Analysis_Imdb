I got this through dvdempire.com. I saw the cover and though this would be your typical slasher low budget flick (the kind I love to watch). <br /><br />What I got instead was a well written and developed character for the first hour or so, and then a cheesy but extremely fun finale that reminded me of the best low budget horror films I grew up with.<br /><br />Not many filmmakers have the cojones now days to just tell a story in detail, without MTV cutting or ADD narrative. That is why I guess some people were turned off by the film.<br /><br />I loved this film!<br /><br />I think Jose Cassella is a triple threat, he scored the film, he shot it very, very well (for DV24p), wrote the thing and directed it. The film looks better than your average $100,000 grade B film ( I am told this thing cost $3500!, try that somebody!).<br /><br />I like to discover little treasures like this, it restores my faith in the new generation of filmmakers.<br /><br />Is it silly and cheesy?...yes, is it insulting for some?...yes, is this for everyone?...nope, but for my money this was a fun ride, a surprising well acted (by the lead), written and made low budget film.<br /><br />I'll be looking for more work by Jose, with a bit more money and a bigger script...who knows? He could throw one right out of the park.<br /><br />Congratulations, you have made a great little film.<br /><br />Luisa.
