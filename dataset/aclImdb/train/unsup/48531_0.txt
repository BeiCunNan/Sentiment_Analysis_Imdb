I'm not a pothead, but I like drug comedies like Grandma's Boy, & Half Baked and thought this would be another goofy pot movie....wow what a piece of crap.<br /><br />I don't think I even smirked once at this movie. I like Anna Faris, Danny Masterson, Adam Brody but the movie was just a waste of film and talent. I mean if it was trying to tell people to not do drugs, good luck with that if they get the audiences' attention quick enough, which it won't. Personally, I don't even think potheads will find this funny at all.<br /><br />I don't know what the director or writers were thinking but, please no more pathetic movies like this.
