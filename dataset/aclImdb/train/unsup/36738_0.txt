I admired James L. Brooks before watching this film. Now, I'm thinking that he'd better retire before his reputation is injured any further. This film was pure syrupy, formulaic hogwash - with tons of bad acting thrown in for good measure. Tea Leoni had me covering my ears to avoid hearing her screeching voice. The scene with the orgasm was so bad I almost suffered convulsions. Adam Sandler was surprisingly the least repulsive member of the cast (How many times has that happened?). You can figure out where the plot is going in about two minutes. If you go, stay for those two minutes, then make a beeline for the exits!!! You've now been warned - Avoid this film at all costs!!!
