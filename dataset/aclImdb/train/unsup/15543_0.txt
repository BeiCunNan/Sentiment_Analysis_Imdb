This show is amazing I cannot wait for it to be picked all the acting is great except for maybe Ving Rhames' character the special effects were veryimpressive for a pilot and the show did a great job of introducing the characters. Justin Hartley is an extremely talented actor and the supporting characters are great. It brings Aquaman into a totally new light and it will bring him from one of the lamer heroes to one of the most popular ones. I pray it becomes a midseason replacement on the CW or even a bigger network(Fox?!?!?!)Gough and Millar were ripped off when this show wasn't picked up I mean this is a high quality show it pains me to think it might not get picked. MERCY REEF IS ON ITUNES FOR 1.99 BUY IT MAYBE IT WILL BE PICKED UP
