The Doom Generation is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. I personally am at a loss as to why Gregg Araki receives the critical praise that he does. But, I concede that I am perhaps looking at it from a narrow point of view. I've only seen The Doom Generation and Nowhere so I don't have too much background in terms of Araki's body of work. Never the less, it seems to me that The Doom Generation is simply a pointless tail of three young adults carrying out acts of violence that have no real point. The acting is deplorable, the dialogue is trite, and the "symbolism" is about as subtle as being poked with a white hot cattle prod. I have heard people attempt to justify this film with comments such as "...the purposely bad dialogue is excellent..." and "it wonderfully depicts the decline of American youth..." but I don't buy it. But hey, quoth Dennis Miller, "That's just my opinion, I could be wrong." Films such as A Clockwork Orange and Kids deal with vaguely similar subjects matters but are far superior to The Doom Generation. Stay as far away from this as you can...unless you're in the mood to see one of the worst films out there.
