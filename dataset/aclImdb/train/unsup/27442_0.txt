Paramout Pictures wanted something from their cartoon supplier Max Fleischer Studios to follow up Disney's success with Snow White. Paramount financed a state of the art animation studio in Miami Flordia so the Fleischer brothers could complete this ambitious undertaking.<br /><br />Max and Dave Fleischer augmented their original New York City staff by over 400 employees to achieve the results Paramount wanted so badly. Did the Fleischer brothers succeed? That, to this day, is a matter of subjective conjecture.<br /><br />Gulliver's Travels is by any standard of animated film techinique a rare gem. The story may not adhere to the book as closely as purists would have wanted, but in the realm of animated cartoons it stands proud.<br /><br />The background artwork is stunningly detailed with rich colors, captured by the three strip Technicolor process. The rotoscoping of the title character is flawless. The painstaking animation of the supporting cast is 100% Fleischer comic whimsy, done this time to the most meticulous standards as yet undertaken by the Fleischers.<br /><br />I would recommend this feature to anyone who appreciates the time and money it took to hand draw this flight into fantasy, both from an enjoyment standard and from a historical look at what the Fleischer staff could accomplish.<br /><br />The film is beautiful, the score regal, and the overall effect spellbinding. See it, hear it, cheer it!
