Idea: this movie presents the story of a soon to be married couple during the days of the revolution and, also the story of a journalist who 15 years later comes in search of their baby....born in those dreadful days. Result: a movie badly directed, produced and played. NOT WORTH WATCHING ! ! !<br /><br />A movie like this i could produce with a budget of 300 dollars. The actors did'nt impress at all...their roles were just stupid: drunken sailor, stupid bride, ???german girl???.<br /><br />1st of all...the sailor returns from seas...goes to Timisoara to marry...get's drunk all the way there....get's drunk there...goes with his bride at the hospital...get's shot by the Communist forces...believed dead is transported to a crematory...lies like stupid and burns alive...STUPID (also very idiotic part where he dreams everything is OK and then we see him burning 5 min later ) bride and her friend - bride is very very stupid as her friends are...their roles r very poorly written and acted Comunist forces and patriotic people - OMG... they have like 300 men and they switch them around...no real drama... 1 other thing...where did they get the cat and the dog in the movie? those have to be like the ugliest animals i have ever seen...if this is how the director sees this country then he should stop directing<br /><br />btw...at the end of the movie ..the baby is born..is a boy.......We never find out why his mother abandons him...but 15 years later he's an "aurolac"...actually the leader of them..and in the end he get's trapped in the underground sewage(and will eventually die...i presume :D )<br /><br />so....whatever u do...don't waste u'r time watching this piece of crap...<br /><br />2/10 (it actually deserved 1...but i support the Romanian cinema :)
