it's a great movie!I loved it!I am not to old but I may answer a few questions...the kidnappers hijacked the VPs plane because it was more important then another plane.They did not use a bomb because they wanted something(the fellow terrorist to be released)...if they had used a bomb of course they didn't have to tell because everyone would know what to do(capture them or stop the bomb).I totally agree with Michael Mays!Maybe if people would not want to see an EXTRA MOVIE then they would like it...it's a great movie if you know how to enjoy good films.Of course it borrows something from 4 movies but come on it is great the way it is.I liked the acing especially the terrorists.
