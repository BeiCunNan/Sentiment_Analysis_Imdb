----SPOILERS INCLUDED---- not that it matters for such a horrible film, though...<br /><br />Carnivorous robots in outer space that self-mutate and multiply underground before annihilating everyone on a forgotten planet in the future... does it sound like the recipe for a REAL turkey? Well, surprise, surprise: it is.<br /><br />It's hard to even begin shredding this unwitting parody of a horror sci-fi. Maybe they should let some of those "screamers" do the job instead: let them loose on the original reels. Good riddance. And take the script too, as you go; if you can find one, that is. <br /><br />Don't worry about the writers and producers; this film was probably the result of some alien self-mutating process deep down some forgotten Hollywood vault anyway. Oh, help us if these films start self-multiplying as well.<br /><br />OK, Peter Weller is decent, that's one star. The rest? Hrm. A clue: don't waste money renting this film to find out.<br /><br />If you're easily thrilled/scared by little lumps of unused screenplay crumpled up and dragged by string under a sand surface, then this is for you.<br /><br />If not, you'll agree that the title "Screamers" probably was inspired by the envisioning of hordes of horrified moviegoers stampeding out of theatres, panicking at the thought of having spent any money on this crap. Now there's a sight that would probably have made a better horror movie, but that's beside the point.<br /><br />Thank IMDb that there is a site like this to warn other people about wasting parts of their precious lives on this garbage.<br /><br />FINAL GRADE: Epically bad.
