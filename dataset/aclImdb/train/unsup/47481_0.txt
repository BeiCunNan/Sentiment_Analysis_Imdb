I have seen the Touch a few hours ago. I don't know why I wasted nearly 100 minutes of my life to watch this disappointment. Sorry but it is just another predictable and forgettable lame eastern action/adventure/martial arts film. The story is weak, acting is terribly bad (or maybe this movie is without acting at all) even for such kind of movies while dialogs look extremely silly and cheesy. Even special effects and fight scenes were ridiculous and hardly watchable. I really liked Crouching Tiger and Hero but The Touch stands too far from them. Obviously it is not the worst movie ever but I can't recommend it for watching even for free. Watch above mentioned movies or other acclaimed martial marts movies but avoid The Touch.<br /><br />3,7 of 10
