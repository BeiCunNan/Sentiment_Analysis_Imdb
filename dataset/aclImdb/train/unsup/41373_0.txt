Rainer255 shot himself after 5 minutes of viewing Bratz.<br /><br />1st: The acting was horrible ranks of the girls Chloe being the worst every time something sad or embarrassing happens all she does is look down but not all the way. Who ever wrote the script should die it was completely clich√© and horrible. No one says Dilio anymore!Why did it skip two years ahead? Yasmin I did not believe for a second she was Spanish everything she said in Spanish was common words my dog knows! What was her little brother who was like 14 hitting on that 11 year old.I was deeply disturbed that they all woke up at the same time looking "beautiful"(lesbians). Even more by the fact that they stop being friends so quickly than became again so easily. Ummm that deaf kid wasn't even deaf...when he first appeared I thought hey an interesting subplot...but I was wrong. The movie seemed to drag on forever there was like a 100 random montages/music videos going on I was so confused. This movie reassures me that future teens are going to be dumb pretty fashionable sluts.
