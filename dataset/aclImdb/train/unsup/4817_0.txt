This was one of the first movies I bought for my VHS collection and would like to see it brought out in DVD with additional commentary.<br /><br />A story of one man's isolation from others by the fact of being a deaf-mute individual with apparently only one true friend (another deaf-mute whom he love's like a brother). In spite of this physical disability he becomes an important part of all the other characters involved by being a confidant and sounding board for their lives. His patience and quiet concern and attention allows them to sort through their own motives and problems and come to an understanding of them.<br /><br />Unfortunately because of this disability he remains isolated from being able to take comfort from them when he needs it most. The HEART of the story. To be able to give so much and yet still be denied the love and understanding of the very people you have helped so much. In that respect many of us are Lonely Hunters.<br /><br />A wonderful and introspective movie about feelings and motivations. View it if you can.
