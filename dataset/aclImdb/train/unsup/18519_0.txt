"Hannity and Colmes" a news program that most people dislike, but I disagree with them I like it because it presents both sides of the story. Really at many times the program can seem like a debate style when both the host conservative(Hannity) and liberal(Colmes) ask the guests the questions. Though many times plenty of guests are conservative like Dick Morris, Ann Coulter and other republicans still the interviews are balanced out when liberal host Alan Colmes ask them the tough questions and he tries to engage them into debate. While Sean Hannity I respect because he doesn't hide anything he makes no bones about it he's a flat out right wing republican! And really Sean is tough I really believe he loves his country and fights against terrorism and the secular causes as he really gets fired up and talks tough to guests especially liberals. Really Sean's honest he pulls no punches back! This program is really good you get to hear both sides of the liberal and conservative stories it's very close to a debate style program.
