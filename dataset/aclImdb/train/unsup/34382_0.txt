Do not buy this piece of crap. I was a loyal fan of all 10 seasons of Stargate SG-1 and stuck through the lower quality Atlantis. This movie was simply unacceptable. There was one scene about twenty minutes into the movie which involves some character development between Teal'c and Tomin which was actually decent but no better than anything from the show. Overall the cinematography, directing, writing, special effects, and plot were lower quality than most made for TV movies. Ben Browder and Michael Shanks also comment on the fact that the movie fails to fill in the gaps in the plot developed over the last ten years and how it really only focuses on seasons 9 and 10. Unfortunately, the only aspects of the story line and character development they did focus on where so overdone that it seemed more like a parody than the conclusion to the series. If nothing else, at least I should give them credit for having the foresight to realize that this had no place in the movie theater. On the other hand, my expectations are so low after watching this that Continuum cannot possibly do worse; well, I shouldn't commit to that. But if nothing else even if Continuum is as much of a disaster as Ark of Truth at least it will show consistency and that is worthy of good mention I suppose.
