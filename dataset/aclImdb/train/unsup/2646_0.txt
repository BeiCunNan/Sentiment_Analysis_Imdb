Well, it is surely an impressive animation movie with a very advanced technique which mixes real and virtual actors. The story is also very well designed, BUT it is not faithful to the original tale. In the Beowulf, Grendel's mother is killed by the hero, the cup appears only in the third act and the dragon has no relationship with Grendel's mother.<br /><br />I understand the necessity to change the story for commercial reasons, but we risk to transfer to the descendant an altered version of story. I personally do not like that. Most people still think that the Andresen's Little Marmaid is an happy ending story because of the Disney cartoon. I do not like that. We need to preserve original tales.
