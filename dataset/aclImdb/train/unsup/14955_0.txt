This movie is by far the most gripping movie of all time! I am a great fan of Mr. Ford and his acting in the movie is spectacular! The graphics alone will shock you and the music by Jerry Goldsmith is very delightful. Anybody who knows Jerry Goldsmith's work will note a Star Trek feel to the music! To sum it up this is a total movie and very watchable over and over again! 10/10
