Well it's not Gone with the Wind, that's for sure! This movie features a woman with one change of underwear who apparently never leaves her apartment, and a bloke who looks better in a wedding dress than I ever did. Plus a mystic cab driver with nothing better to do than hang around waiting for them. And they don't eat in three days.<br /><br />But leaving aside the practicalities, I enjoyed it immensely, although I'm not sure I can define why. My teen age kids bought me this DVD for Mother's Day - or to be more exact, I bought it and instructed my kids to give it to me. My motives are probably too murky to discuss here. <br /><br />But having only seen David Wenham previously as Faramir in The Lord of the Rings, in drag as Audrey in Moulin Rouge and as the dubious Carl in Van Helsing ( a movie of quite excruciating badness), it was rather disconcerting to hear his real accent. I mean I knew in theory that Wenham was Australian, but hearing him sound quite so much like Richie Benaud, the cricket commentator whose dulcet tones take me straight back to childhood and my late father's obsession with the thud of leather on willow, was almost more than I could handle.<br /><br />But I'm digressing. The movie. Lots of fun sex, which is always a good thing if well done, and this is pretty well done, especially towards the end of the movie as the couple really get into each other, lots of comments on men and women, (if a little clich√©d), and a happy ending, and it never takes itself too seriously. It is a little heavy handed in places - I'm thinking here of the close ups of the women's mouths prior to the blow job in bath scene. Not subtle. Not a great work of art, but mildly erotic, entertaining and quite funny. <br /><br />And when evaluating their various past relationships, the script never plunges into the kind of overwrought pathos that would be obligatory in Hollywood. When Cin discovers the photo in Josh's wallet, I was horribly afraid we'd get an explanation of the "love of my life killed in a tragic auto wreck" variety. Instead we get a quite refreshing "she messed me about so I moved to London" line. Real life, for all that it's mundane.<br /><br />David Wenham does "bemused everyman" to perfection as Josh, and is obviously an actor of huge range. Susie Porter (who is gorgeous) is both vulnerable and tough where necessary as Cin. They look like real people, and seem just as dim-witted as the rest of us. I shall watch it again.
