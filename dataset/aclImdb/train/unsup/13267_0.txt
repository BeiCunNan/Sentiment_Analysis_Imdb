When it exploded onto screens in the mid 1980's, OscarÂ® nominated director<br /><br />Dominique Deruddere's film CRAZY LOVE divided critics and audiences as few<br /><br />films before or since.<br /><br />Championed by Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, the film was picked<br /><br />up for US distribution. Stars like Madonna and Sean Penn attended the LA<br /><br />premiere. But the films shocking subject matter and startling imagery were too rich a combination for audiences at the time. The film vanished from sight,<br /><br />becoming an instant cult classic - much written about but seldom seen and now reappraised as one of the most underrated films of the 1980's.<br /><br />Taking his cue from stories by cult American author Charles Bukowski,<br /><br />Deruddere's film tells the story of a man's life via three nights, spread over 20 years. We see his hero, Harry Voss, first as a romantic young boy of 12, then as an acne ridden teenager, lost in unrequited love, and finally as a drink sodden drop out, for whom no act is too dreadful to contemplate...with terrible and yet deeply moving consequences.<br /><br />It's a film that, once seen, is never likely to be forgotten. A film with a unique, bitter sweet and poetic mood that manages to be funny and tragic at the same<br /><br />time. A minor masterpiece.
