While this review is generally negative, I want to make a positive point first. Another poster here noted that 'Moonlight Mile' is so much better than, for example, the trite cartoons of Quentin Tarantino. I agree. This film attempts to deal honestly with the human condition.<br /><br />But the film doesn't work. To see why, I suggest comparing it with 'In the Bedroom' or 'Summer of 42' or 'Passion Fish' which all deal more or less with similar subject matter. 'Moonlight Mile' attempts to be a Robert Mulligan movie but without Robert Mulligan. In a similar vein, the story is set in Massachusetts but in actual fact, the characters are from Hollywood.<br /><br />I don't regret having rented it. The mostly B-side, late 1960s, early 1970s music is omnipresent, and I was always waiting for the next tune to come along. The movie is slow, usually serious but sometimes funny. It held my interest, but there were too many false notes.
