Adaptation of James Graham's western book plays like a leftover second-feature from the 1940's. Robert Mitchum is very likable playing a machine-gun toting "priest" who, along with two criminals, is cornered into an assassination plot in 1920's Central America. Curious combination of cheeky asides and formula bloodshed takes a good while to jell; director Ralph Nelson appears to be attempting a quirky approach, but he doesn't go far enough with his dark-humored take. However, the pacing does pick up after a draggy first hour, and the supporting players are interesting. Rita Hayworth, cast as a sympathetic Senora, makes her final screen appearance. ** from ****
