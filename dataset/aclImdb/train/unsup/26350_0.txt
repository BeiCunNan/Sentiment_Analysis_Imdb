This film was a particular highlight in Marilyn Monroe's career. It was the first - and unfortunately, only - film made by her production company Marilyn Monroe Productions and was also the first time she had made a film abroad. The film is set in London and Monroe stars opposite the great Laurence Olivier - who also directed the film - in one of her best comic roles. She plays a chorus girl named Elsie Marina who is spotted one night by the Prince Regent of Carpathia who is in London on political business. Monroe sparkles as ever and outshines Olivier in a genuinely adorable and funny performance. She plays up her "dumb blonde" image for most of the film, but towards the end the audience is completely assured of her intelligence and how she may have been judged unfairly by the chauvinistic Prince Regent. The film was nominated for five BAFTAs and is an underrated classic.
