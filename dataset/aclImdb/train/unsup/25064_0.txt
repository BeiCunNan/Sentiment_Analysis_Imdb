I love Ginger Lynn, first off. I remember being a knee high little twerp, stealing her videos from my dad and "watching" them. It was nice to see her in something again. This is a way good movie. The cast is great, the direction is great, and the jokes are great. I laughed, I cried (not really), I even bought some old Ginger Lynn videos because of K&C. This is definitely not one for the kids (that is, unless you're a really irresponsible parent) and it'd probably be best to not let them watch this one. I'm really looking forward to seeing if Vincent Rocca makes another film. I'd really like to see what else he can do and how far his career can go. I think K&C is the start of a beautiful film career.
