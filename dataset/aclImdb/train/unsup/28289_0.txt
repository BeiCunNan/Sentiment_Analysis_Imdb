This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The acting is terrible, the musical score doesn't even fit the scenes - it's just random Tchaikovsky pieces inserted in random places. When some characters are speaking French (they were in France I think, I only got that from one line saying it was good to travel), it's just dubbed over. The actual actors/actresses don't even speak French. To top it off, there are no subtitles indicating what these actors are actually saying. In one scene there is about 2 minutes of yelling between a French transient and somebody walking with Tchaikovsky - very heated discourse - and there are no subtitles. The cinematography is horrific - tons of shaky shots/off center shots/ etc. Basically, this is a film where a bunch of extras were put in with a shoddy story (I'm not entirely sure there was a flowing story), terrible dialogue, and a musical score that never fits the scene. This is, without a doubt, the worst film I have ever seen in my life. This is a travesty of film.
