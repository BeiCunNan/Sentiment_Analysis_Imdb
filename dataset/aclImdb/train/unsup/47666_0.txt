To begin with, i find it funny how the guy that started all this crap did not die. The acting is very VERY bad. At the end when she is getting dragged by the hairs, she shows no sign of pain and yells very boringly ''ahhhh'' A grown @** woman is more scared of the caveman looking farmer than the little kids, they didn't even seemed worried or scared at all. Something more dumber is that they all seem to see there friend dead before them dying, it is repetitive, the only different death is the last one. Finally, they said he didn't feel a thing when they bit his nose off, how come he was wining when he got stabbed or his hand was getting hit with a pole? Don't watch it if you really want to be disappointed.
