While it's of infinitely better quality than the T&A show that is Ghost Whisperer (who would've thought skimpy outfits + ghost mysteries would actually be boring), I still was not impressed much by this show. It's just....too full of clich√©'s. The tough, honest cop father, the hippie gypsy mother, the star athlete brother (who's facing a crisis that interrupted his perfect life), the nerd super-genius brother, etc.<br /><br />While all of these caricatures would've been great if this were a Monty-Python-ish tongue-in-cheek show, I get the feeling that they (the producers) are actually serious! It's long, drawn out and slow like a typical CSI-ish drama with just a not-so-subtle hint of religious preaching now and then (discounting testimony's from "God", since we'd expect that, but the "it's only logical to believe in God" speech from the nerd-brother?).<br /><br />All in all, it's not a badly produced show, per se. One can tell that it's got a good crew behind it. But there's something missing amongst the decent acting (mostly), good props, set, lighting, cast, etc. It needs an interesting story.
