We all interpret someone else's motivations and actions based upon a variety of subjective factors- our background, interpersonal history, friends/family influences . . . This short film really puts into focus how easily misinterpreted someone else's intentions can be based upon our own vantage point. And in 30 minutes it really makes you think and take stock of where you sit and how you would react to scenarios that the characters found themselves in. Would be really interesting to watch this movie with a group of friends both male/female to discuss our interpretations. Anyhow, highly recommend this film for entertainment value but also for some not too heavy philosophical thinking.
