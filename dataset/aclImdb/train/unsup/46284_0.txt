The the writers even read the book?!?!? I believe that Eragon and Eldest are two of the best books i've read and the movie was disgraceful. It seamed more like they read the summary on the back of the book and made a movie of what they thought it was about. So what happened to the dwarfs? the scar he gets from Durza? and a million other things they left out? They killed the Ra' Zac easily when the Ra' Zac are still in the third book. The Urgals instead of being a different race they are just barbaric men with tattoos. Arya leaves to Ellesm√©ra without Eragon?? how can they even make a second movie based on the second book. My personal opinion is the director didn't really care for the book and only made the movie as a job. A director shouldn't make a film unless he really likes the idea and desires to make it come to life. I was impressed on how well movies like The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) and the Lord of the Rings Trilogy did in making the movies as real and as close to the books as they can. I know that they can't fit an entire book in but they could have at least given the book the respect it deserves. The Harry Potter series aren't the best at being accurate but they're close enough to give them credit. I should not feel like a did Hollywood a disfavor by supporting a movie, which is how i felt after seeing it tonight. If i were them i would destroy any evidence of this new film and start over from scratch, and put people in charge who actually have a love for the book. Why did Christopher Paolini give the permission to disgrace and destroy his story. I am currently a film student and i would have volunteered all my time to help them make the movie because apparently they needed all the help they could get.
