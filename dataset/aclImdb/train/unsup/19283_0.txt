"Rough Riders" is an excellent movie about the 1st Volunteer Cavalry a.k.a. the Rough Riders. The movie begins with the declaration of war and the efforts of Theodore Roosevelt to raise a cavalry regiment that will fight in Cuba. The period of training for the troopers is grueling but you learn much about the characters that will be featured. Most of the movie concerns the Rough Riders in combat, especially the famous charge at Kettle and SanJuan Hills. The fighting is quite exciting and authentic. The Spanish-American War may be regarded as an imperialistic war but the "Rough Riders" is well-acted and shows the human as well as propaganda side of warfare.
