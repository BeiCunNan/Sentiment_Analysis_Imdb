Could probably be summed up as reasonably entertaining, predictable nonsense.<br /><br />Every scene moving one to the other was so predictable. In fact you could say everything that happened could have been foretold within the first half hour. <br /><br />It would be wrong to judge the acting as there was none, but in fairness the film did not need to be acted out. Rather than acting, basic motions were more than adequate given the plot, the location and the fact that it was pitch dark all of the time. <br /><br />However, it did entertain in a fashion. Whether this was down to the predictability of the storyline or whether it did really entertain I'm not sure. <br /><br />I'm glad I neither specifically paid to see at the movies nor paid for it at the local DVD hire shop (watched it on a TV movie channel). But why do I still have this weird notion that I quite enjoyed it??
