This movie seems like it was put together out of desperation, not the desire to make a movie. It had a terrible plot, bad acting, and the characters were not believable. It was a Disney made for TV movie, which explains much of this. Though not as bad as "Mom's Got a Date With a Vampire", it was still not worth seeing.<br /><br />If you want to see a movie that doesn't require much brain work, this would be a good one. I give it 2 out of 10 stars.
