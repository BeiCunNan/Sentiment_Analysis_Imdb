This is one of those movies that you have to sit and think about for awhile. Initially when I accidentally started watching it, I thought it was the worst thing I had ever seen, what with the poor editing job. (I think that may have been done for effect.)The sequencing was bizarre as well. It was also one of those movies that you either love or hate. I hated it initially, then right at the end, I realized that I actually enjoyed it. I threw aside the petty details, such as the huge winter mistake, and several other minor details, and ended up enjoying it. I think that the whole movie acted as a perception altering experience, slowly unraveling the plot until the end, tying everything together. That is just my opinion. So, if you look into the movie, you may think it's better than the first glance. Also, look for the Al Franken cameo!
