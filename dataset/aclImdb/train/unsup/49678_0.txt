Once again, here an Australian film that is let down utterly by its mediocre screenplay. Why isn't there more funding pumped into developing screenplays in this country? Several more drafts and this script may have turned out okay. As it is, the characters are one-dimensional and under-developed, as is the plot.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I felt the casting was also pretty misguided in The Jammed. Accents were poor and, as a result, it was difficult to suspend disbelief enough to accept the actors as their characters. The actors did a fair job with the material they were given; it wasn't their fault that they were miscast.<br /><br />Really, responsibility all boils down to the writer-director-producer. (Yet again, writer-director -- when are we going to see specialist screenwriters supported in Australia?) Four stars for effort, but it's a pity that more time wasn't spent tightening up the story before production got underway.
