A college student(Tori Spelling),by way of a friend's prank, becomes involved in the world of the high dollar escort business. She is swept away with the fancy lifestyle and the free flowing money. When she realizes she wants to be free of her exploitation; her world caves in on her. She ends up confessing her secretive life style after being charged with attempted murder.<br /><br />I actually saw this on Showtime, but it seemed like the Lifetime Network, where women usually always survive and conquer. Despite the subject matter, this flick is pretty tame. No questionable language, no nudity and no soundtrack to break up your boredom.<br /><br />I have to admit this is the best thing I have seen Ms. Spelling do, and that is stretching it a bit. Also in the cast are: Susan Blakely, Scott Plank and Jeri Ryan.
