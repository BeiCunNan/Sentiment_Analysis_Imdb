The premise of this familiar actioner had some potential, with Arnold Schwarzenegger getting to act like a "bad guy" at least for a while, but unfortunately the theme is "explored" in just ONE scene, where he admits that he likes his new lifestyle as the right hand of a mob boss. But eventually he loses his patience, gets his machine gun and decides to wipe out the bad guys the old-fashioned way. And the viewer is inevitably going to wonder: why did they torture us for over an hour with all the secret-agent business, just to get to a "Commando"-type final showdown, where Arnie is able to kill dozens of enemies simply because they are too stupid and slow to get him first? There is no answer to that question, and that's what makes this film ultimately excruciating. (*1/2)
