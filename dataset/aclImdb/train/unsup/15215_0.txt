they think that if we show the violence in a different way we will be more creative ...but they do not respect to mother identity..and they don't want us to watch all the film because we couldn't stand it only one hour.... everyone left the place... No human being can afford to stay meanwhile those guys are having fun with the girls that will make you think if they were your girlfriends or anyone you know.We should not make producers think they are on the way to win with this film.We must think clearly that anywhere anything may happen to anyone but the way to be more conscious is not the way on this movie to watch.People that will be conscious by the help of the film are not much more than ones that will probably make those behaviours unconsciously or consciously on another people so this way is wrong to be object lesson
