This fun little romp into the world of billiards is just as good or better than many films I've seen in all the various video stores and yet I had to schmooze my way into obtaining a screener copy. It amazes me how even after you've completed a pretty darn good movie, you have to wait and wait for it to see any kind of release.<br /><br />The film itself is a romantic comedy that most of the time hits it's mark and flows well and maintains interest. The language is pretty bawdy at times, but accurate in representing the culture-du-jour and the characters are all believable and relateable (I'm sure neither of those words are readable, let alone definable).<br /><br />The title is a bit esoteric, and at first glance makes me think of Hershey's Kisses and chocolate carobs, but watching Nicole Rayburn as Tara certainly took my mind off everything else. To quote a famous line from one of my all-time favorite movies, "Schwing... Yada, yada, yada".<br /><br />Bottom line, a fun film, a great first film, and entertaining to the last ball.
