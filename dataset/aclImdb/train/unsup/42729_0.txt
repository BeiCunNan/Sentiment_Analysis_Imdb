What a HORRIBLE movie. The dialogue sounds like it was written by a 7 year old, the acting is atrocious (you can tell the people are reading off the script), there is absolutely no plot whatsoever, new characters are introduced out of nowhere and they don't even have a purpose to being in the movie, the camera work is laughable, the action scenes are the worst I have ever seen in my entire life, editing was so bad it was noticeable when scenes were cut out and replaced, the music was terrible (it didn't add anything to the scenes it made the scenes even more confusing and horrific), and the wardrobe was just rediculous (In a bad, bad way). What's up with all the karate scenes that are repeated over and over and over, they aren't even different karate scenes, they are exactly the same ones we are shown from the beginning to the end. If it weren't for those cheezy, depressing, fighting scenes, the movie would've been 10 minutes long as my roomate said. All in all, this deserved a 0, but I had to give it a 1 because there is no lower score. I hope whoever made this film was really, really, high and just decided to make a joke film, because if it was a serious movie, wow I feel bad for him.
