This movie is pure, unadulterated cinematic genius. The only reason that I did not give it a 10 was that it did not surpass the greatness of Bas's previous movie, The Eliminator. First of all, I would like to address all you people who gave this movie any lower than 3 stars, which was a surprising amount of you. You are all bad people. And ugly. Probably. Many of you commented on how "fake" the scenes of vault gears, rocket launchers, etc looked like. Well, let me ask you this. Have you actually been inside the workings of a fully functional vault door? Have you actually been staring down the barrel of a rocket launcher as it fired its missile at you? Have you actually seen a helicopter explode as its blades landed not 2 feet in front of you? Have any of you actually experienced the blast of a C4 detonation? For all we know, the blast could be so strong that it effects its immediate surroundings seconds before it actually combusts. Those of you "critics" out there should really think about experiencing these things before you actually go out and condemn this movie for its faults.<br /><br />As for the movie, it is cinema at its finest. The lead character Kennedy Kaludes, played by Laci Szabo, is a thief, a hero, but most importantly, a loving father. I love how you are able to identify with the character, since right off the bat he give us some vital information about himself. It was once said that you never really know someone until you know their favorite food and color. I was really very surprised to hear that his favorite things are, respectively ***SPOILER*** Philly Cheese Steaks (although we later learn that he likes those big New York pretzels) and purple ***END SPOILER*** His daughter Milla, played by Brynn Lucas, is a naive, young girl who wants to love her father, despite him not really knowing her. It is very touching during the ending of the movie, when we learn that her favorite food and color is ***SPOILER*** Clams and also purple ***END SPOILER***. Bas Rutten plays General Matos, an antagonist with a sense of humor. This role fits him very well, because he is a very funny guy behind the scenes, as said by his fellow crew, and can do one hell of a British accent. Paul Logan plays Matos's right hand man, Frix. Oh, Frix. Grace, played by Diana Lee Inosanto is a fabulous actress with the fighting skills to back it up. She beat up those inept security guards like no one else could. In all, this movie is one that the whole family can enjoy. Thank you Bas. Keep 'em coming.
