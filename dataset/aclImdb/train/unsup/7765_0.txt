After reading several positive reviews I decided to seek this film out as an avid Zombie film buff. I've now came to the conclusion that those reviews could only have been written by the film makers.<br /><br />As the film starts it is somewhat promising, as the shaky camera moves through a seemingly abandoned house by the means of clumsy editing and what can only be described as library muzak in the background, you however comfort yourself with the fact that this is an amateur film and hopefully when the movie gets going all of those failures will be forgotten.<br /><br />What instead happens is the viewer gets attacked by flaming egos not seen since "Brown Bunny," I can only assume the script writing process involved asking a depressed 15 year old to recant what he would of done in his moments of social failure, whilst mixing in lines rejected from "Mall Rats".<br /><br />The acting and narrative is unnatural, tired and clumsy to say the least. During every bite scene the victim fails to flinch nor attempt to get out of the way and those around him stand with their mouths open as weapons suddenly appear out of thin air. And the zombie with the pentagram on her rear? This terrible scene is one you must view for yourself, it would make Ed Wood himself cringe.<br /><br />I could talk forever on the failings but I'll spare you, there is one up side to this film, if they get sponsorship from a tight-vest company (as several of the cast can be caught wearing them) they may raise enough money to have every copy of this film burnt and their names and reputations spared.
