I have seen some truly awful movies in my time, but The Versace Murder could actually be the one - The Best of the Worst(TM). I could really sing this movie's praises, but I wouldn't want to spoil it for you ... it's like The Matrix - nobody can tell you what it is; you have to experience it for yourself.<br /><br />Below are my theories on what made The Versace Murder the gem of movie making that it is.<br /><br />- 40% of the budget was spent on the one cop's sunglasses.<br /><br />- Rather than being paid, the "actors" were actually required to give the director oral sex in order to be allowed to appear in the movie.<br /><br />- During the shooting of one of the scenes, the script writer had to nip of to the bathroom, so the director told everyone to just yell their lines.<br /><br />- While shooting another scene, the director had to nip off to the bathroom, so the scriptwriter told the camera man to just shoot the cop's crotch.<br /><br />- Whenever the director and the scriptwriter were simultaneously in the bathroom, the accountant took over their duties. The producers were never on set, because they just couldn't watch.<br /><br />- Prior to writing the script for The Versace Murder, the script writer once wrote a slogan for a t-shirt. (I believe it was "F*CK YOU YOU F*CKING F*CK.)<br /><br />Runners up for the title of Best of the Worst:<br /><br />- War Camp (There is no script, and the entire movie was shot on the first take.)<br /><br />- Ancient Evil: Scream of the Mummy (Have you ever seen a chubby mummy?)
