I can't add much to the great comments already on here and I will not bore you with anecdotes about growing up in Cumbernauld. What I will say though is that as a teenager, on the first couple of viewings, I lost interest after Carol turns up instead of Dorothy to tell Gregory she's not coming. I was not happy. I thought, "How could she do that to Gregory/me?" I could not enjoy the rest of the movie and could not care less that Gregory got to parade around with 3 other cute lassies.. I guess though that says more about me at that time than anything else.<br /><br />I'm much better now.<br /><br />Gregory and Susan for ever.<br /><br />Magic
