While this movie is still fresh in my mind, I want to commend Joseph Gorden-Levitt for taking on a role few actors would dare to touch. I would have, but I haven't had the pleasure of meeting Gregg Araki - yet. I've faithfully followed Araki's career since TOTALLY F'ED UP and I've since felt he could make an important and profound film - if only given the opportunity and the budget. He finally has! 3RD ROCK is one of my all time favorite TV series, and I've since felt JGL had could prove himself as one of the all time great actors, if only the right script presented itself. This is it, guys! Keep up the good work. I can't wait to see Araki's next film OR JGL's next performance. If you guys were to break up, it would be like The Beatles or Zepp breaking up all over again - so don't do it!
