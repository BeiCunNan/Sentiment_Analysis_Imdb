Sadly, this is Bette Davis's last screen appearance. The script is so bad, that Davis refused to continue filming until changes were made. When the producers refused, Davis left the production in the middle of filming and her part was re-written to explain her disappearance. Her character, by magical powers, becomes a cat!
