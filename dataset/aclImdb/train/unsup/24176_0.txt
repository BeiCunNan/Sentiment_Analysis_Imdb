I really enjoyed this film. The handling of a legendary story was good. How the military can make mistakes was well handled, I liked the squaddie's flirtation with the cook. The way in which the "rivals" were united in rescuing the boy and hoping the water horse would make its escape to the sea, was good. All actors who took the part of Angus were superb, special effects were also superb and I recognised some of the locations. I sometimes wonder if there should be a "target audience" for films. This is the type of film which (like Night in the Museum) can appeal to all ages. It's a delight to watch something with no offensive language, (which, for me, spoils such films as Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones) and no incomprehensible transatlantic colloquialisms. Make more films like this please!!
