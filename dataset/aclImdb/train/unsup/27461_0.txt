i expected to see a good horror movie, when i bought "the living dead girl" but i was disappointed. the dialogues are boring, the plot is unimaginative, the camera stands somewhere in the corner without dramatic.the whole movie is long-winded. the special fx are ridiculous and the erotic-factor is zero, just some naked women standing around.
