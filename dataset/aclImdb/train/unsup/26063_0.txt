There were a few funny scenes in this movie but the rest was sexist garbage mainly about women settling for men who were rapists, pimps, etc. because they couldn't get anyone any better or because they were too stupid to know better.<br /><br />It also made fun of women who are older than 40 saying the 0 in 40 stood for "old, too old to get married". <br /><br />I didn't really find it funny to make fun of women who are old or fat or ugly. There were also some really gross sex scenes and the plot was stupid, and campy. <br /><br />I think the people who will most enjoy this movie are gay men because that's the only audience I think that won't be very offended by all the jokes about how these women try so desperately to get men. <br /><br />
