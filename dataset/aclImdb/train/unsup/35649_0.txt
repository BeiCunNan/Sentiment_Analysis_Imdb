This was a slightly funny sometimes entertaining family comedy, but you can tell how Disney is going into the live action, and will have some unsuccessful movies to now, Meet The Deedles, Mr. Magoo, and others.<br /><br />I give Man of the House a 3.5 out of 10. Rated PG for mild violence and language.
