It's never very promising when advertising campaigns for upcoming television shows have to constantly remind us of how unoriginal the program is by endlessly comparing it to other popular shows. "10 Items or Less" was promoted, in fact, with the following slogan: "If you thought working in an office was funny, wait until you see what it's like to work in a CONVENIENCE STORE!!" <br /><br />Oh, wow! Brilliant! Let's rip-off a television show which is already a remake of another international television show from Britain! Awesome! High fives TBS execs! You really nailed it on the head this time!<br /><br />I mean, after a string of flop original TV shows I imagine they must have all been sitting in their meeting with a collective frown trying to figure out how to (finally) achieve success. "How about we make a fake documentary show...and put it in an office?"<br /><br />- "Hasn't that already been done?" - "Oh, yeah, right." (Pause) - "I know! Let's put it in a CONVENIENCE store!" - "Yes! Brilliant idea!" - "High fives all around!"<br /><br />Not only are the characters flat, uninteresting and virtually _all_ rip-offs of characters from The Office (including Leslie, who is a painfully unfunny Steve Carrell/Andy Gervais wannabe) - their second episode DIRECTLY STEALS from an episode of the TV show "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"! It's not just a casual similarity, either. <br /><br />The episode of Sunny featured the owners of a bar trying to exploit a water stain on the wall of their establishment which resembles Jesus. The new episode of "10 Items" (which premieres in 15 minutes) features the EXACT same plot line!<br /><br />I struggled through the first episode trying to understand just how on earth such a desperate show could ever be greenlit. This is the stuff of film parody. There are the stereotypes of dumb executives trying to constantly cash in on successful fads - but this is almost TOO outrageous to be real! It's a lame-brain copycat right down to its very directorial style and plot lines.<br /><br />The debut was one of the worst TV show debuts I've ever seen. Premieres are never fantastic in most cases but this was agonizing to sit through.<br /><br />This show will disappear very soon, and I hope everyone involved never has a chance to work again. Why? Well, because I'm a rather evil person who will no doubt find great delight in watching this pack of moronic actors have little-to-no success in the future.<br /><br />Good luck, guys!
