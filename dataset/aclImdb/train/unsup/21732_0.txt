i cant say a negative word about this film as i would obviously be taken it out of context as it is without drought the sort of film the typifies quality direction acting and great moody dialogue not to mention the original scenes. it has no relation to lock stock,its far more left field than that watch this film its great.also the acting is superb charlot Coleman's last film before she tragically died saw a performance second to none. its a shame films like this arnt being made in the uk anymore, talent is hard to come by and films like this and others of this jonrer, this i mean the ones that have the rare power to create atmosphere and this is one of them.
