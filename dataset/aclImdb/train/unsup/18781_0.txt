I have already submitted this comment to IMDb for correction, but haven't seen anything yet.<br /><br />The credits for The Enforcer show Will Hutchins as "Stakeout cop"(uncredited), but does anyone else agree that that role and character were actually part of the liquor store stakeout/holdup sequence in Magnum Force instead? The sequence, right after Harry has dinner with Carol McCoy and her kids, has Harry entering the back of the store, where Early Smith is posing as a cashier. Harry heads to the manager's office where, along with Will Hutchins, dressed in uniform and wearing a bulletproof vest and holding a shotgun, is waiting as well. Harry sees the three perps walk into the store and comments, "Well, there are three salty looking dudes". After the shootout, where Will Hutchins' character bungles part of it because he hesitates, he actually has a line where he shakes his head after looking at the carnage Harry has wrought and says, "I've never shot a man", whereby Harry looks at him in disgust and says something to the effect of "Help out with the customers, will ya?" Does anyone else remember it this way, and note that Will Hutchins is credited to the wrong movie, or am I missing a role in The Enforcer that I forgot about? I remember Hutchins because I hadn't really seen him since Merrill's Marauders and Sugarfoot and happened across this in the IMDb.<br /><br />Remembering trivia like this is a disease, I tell ya!
