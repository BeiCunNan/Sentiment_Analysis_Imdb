There really isn't much to say about this "film". It has the odd smile or chuckle moment, but on the whole it's bland, predictable and generally pretty dull.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it three out of ten was for the annoyingly catchy jingle (which I hope I will forget soon....please God!). Otherwise its junk. Or mostly junk, interspersed with adverts for Smirnoff Ice.<br /><br />The lead characters give OK performances, but they really don't have anything much to work with.<br /><br />Best advice: Avoid it like a dentist's appointment. Or better yet, make a dentist's appointment instead of watching it.
