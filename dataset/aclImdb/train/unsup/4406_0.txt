Ahhhhh, "Phantasm"! Quite a scary flick...I was first exposed to this little horror about 15 years ago by my Pop. I doubt that I will ever give a "horror" movie a 10, but this is as close as I have ever gotten. Tall Man is absolutely frightening and the "ball" is as fearsome an accessory as ever has appeared on screen. 10 times the fear factor of any hockey mask, hatchet or claw!<br /><br />You could argue for days about why this film is scary; the acting is mediocre at best, the scenes can be confusing and the resolution isn't exactly spectacular--however, this movie gets under your skin! Although never heavy-handed, it forces your head back and twists it's way deep into your psyche, sure to rear it's ugly mug after the lights go out. The inexplicable appeal is probably somewhere to be found within the setting (funeral home), spooky music (gruesome sound-effects) and style. It's subtle eerie-ness is totally unnerving and the fact that your imagination is given just enough information to be dangerous doesn't help.<br /><br />I spent weeks of my childhood, alone in bed, writhing beneath the blade of it's cold imagery. This is one that stays with you...whether you want it to or not. It's actually better on a second or third viewing, but I wouldn't recommend watching it very often. 9/10 for provoking my imagination in a way no other "horror" film ever has...
