I see why this movie went straight to video. Who in their right mind would choose Danny DeVito over Paul Rudd? Did the director see them without shirts? Anyway, this movie is a poor excuse of film making. It tries to be something it is not (mainly funny and aimed at adults). The ending comes out of nowhere and makes Paul Rudd's character seem like the antagonist when it is the wife who jacking up on her vibrator and sleeping with every guy who walks around. Also, is that the only thing this woman has going for her - an orgasm? And sticking a pager inside herself, why is that funny? It was a bad ripoff of Absolutely Fabulous. If this is what passes for adult comedies in Hollywood, no wonder Indie films are getting awards.
