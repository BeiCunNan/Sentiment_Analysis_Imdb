What a dumb movie. The special effects were so horrible I started to think this was really just a 3rd grade class project. The creators decided to cast some moderately pretty women in this film to make up for the complete lack of acting, personality, or talent. I can only imagine the budget for this film being in the realm of some kid's allowance. An incredibly poorly-done "movie" based on an incredible story. If you don't have the budget or talent to do the original story justice, then hands off please. With series like Battlestar Galactica out there, I expect rental DVDs to be of at least decent quality. The giant ape was a joke, the scorpions were moronic, and those flying dragon things? Please. And how come the flight attendant mistook her own plane for a fighter jet?
