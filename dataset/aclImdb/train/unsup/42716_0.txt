My wife wanted to rent this and watch it. It really is cute in some places, but there's nothing here that's any better than the Planet Earth episode on polar bears. In fact, the opening sequence of the bears emerging from their den is remarkably similar...<br /><br />The storyline is contrived and the references to changing climate blatantly obvious.<br /><br />It truly is sad that these magnificent animals die, but that's the essence of the natural world, right? Some animals prey on others, climate changes in natural cycles. Polar bears survived the last stint of global warming just fine. The ice sheets were so small 1000 years ago that crops could be grown in Greenland. Wine grapes were grown in England. Where were the polar bears then? This movie was not nearly as good as "March of the Penguins". I came away from that movie inspired. I came away from this one wanting to gag.
