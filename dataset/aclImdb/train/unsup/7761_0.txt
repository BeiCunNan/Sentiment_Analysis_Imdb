It's so much easier to pick out all the bad things in a film and write a really crappy review. Trust me, I've written my share of crappy reviews. However Dead Life was not one of them. Dead Life IS in fact shot on 8mm, and it looks grainy and low quality and you know what? That's a good thing. The film quality adds to its gritty retro feel. The effects are MUCH better than what you see in indie. Amateur acting, gee that's funny given that the actors are...wait for it...AMATEURS! I will concede that Dead Life isn't for everyone. If your true love is stupid teens and tired horror clich√©'s then steer clear. If your love for zombies is insatiable then you could do a whole helluva lot worse than Dead Life. At least the dude on the cover is IN the movie, which can't really be said for a lot of independent horror these days. Don't base your judgment solely on what's written here at IMDb, if you're a zombiephile do a search, you'll find plenty of reviews singing the praises of Dead Life.
