I have just watched long time dead and I must say I really enjoyed it. I went to see it not knowing what to expect, not knowing what is was about. An what I got was a good thriller with a psychological edge.<br /><br />The movie starts off introducing us to some student housemates, and there lives, quickly cutting off to a night out clubbing, and that is when the problems begin. Growing bored they decide to use and ouija board to contact dead spirits, but get more than they bargained for when they summon a fire demon. The Demon possesses one of the group, and gradually they all start dying one by one...<br /><br />Its not a typical slasher movie, and is different because its getting into your head, and is a very psychological based terror, although there a plenty of jumpy moments.<br /><br />Joe Absolom from Eastenders fame, reemerges in the movie, and is typical of scared Matthew.<br /><br />I am disappointed to see that this movie is not being released, with the right promotion, I think it could have done as well as scream, I know what you did last summer.<br /><br />All in all, a very modern, slick movie, with a nice little twist at the end.<br /><br />For this style, an 8 out of 10.<br /><br />
