Oh come on! Why did they make this film. The beginning is so nauseating and bloated with kiddie crap that this film must never be called a FAMILY film! If you're gonna take your kid to a FAMILY movie, than go see Shrek (Which actually has clever dialogue) This piece of trash is almost not worth reviewing! 1/2* out of ****.
