I was disappointed when I purchased this on DVD. I assumed when I saw the disc available that it was the sequel to "Ninja Scroll", and thus not happy when I found out it wasn't. I think this was deliberately portrayed as a sequel too (mainly based off of the title, the main character's name coming second). Nonetheless, once I got past this I decided to judge Resurrection on its own merits. It beat "Ninja Scroll" in one respect, it has a lot more gore. However, the plot is what gets me confused. I've had this problem before, mainly in regards to anime series, but in this instance I don't think it is a translation issue, I think it just isn't clear. It ends suddenly, leaving a lot of questions left unanswered. Now, a sequel could be used to explain much of the confusion that was created, but I doubt anyone will do that. Last I heard, there are no plans for a sequel as is. In any case, if you just want to see a lot of blood flying, go ahead and watch. If you want the complex storyline of "Ninja Scroll", just stay away.
