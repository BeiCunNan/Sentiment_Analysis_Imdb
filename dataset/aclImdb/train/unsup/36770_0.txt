Sorry, but I have to say there was only one aspect of this film that was enjoyable, and that was the sweeping scenery. And these wonderful scenes were sandwiched in between the most absurd and drivel filled scenes imaginable.<br /><br />I gave the movie about 30 minutes and had to press eject. Too much pointless obscenity, nudity, and violence. If the plot made any sense I would have tried to stick it out. Perhaps a film critic and or film student would have enjoyed this (for reasons unknown to me or anyone else that could care less about such things), but I certainly couldn't.<br /><br />If you are like most people who probably rented this because of Dwight, don't bother. For everything he is credited for on this movie (writing, starring, directing and musical score), he fails - miserably.
