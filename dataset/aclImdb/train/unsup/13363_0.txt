I really enjoyed the movie, it was great and touching. My friend says the book was 10 times better, that's why I can't wait to read it, cause the movie was GRREAT!!!!! I love Missionaries and what they do for the world. I'm so happy things like this about my church are being shown to others. I know whether you're Mormon or not you will enjoy the movie.
