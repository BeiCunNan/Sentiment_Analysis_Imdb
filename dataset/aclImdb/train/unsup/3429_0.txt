Saw Jerusalema last weekend. I found the film to be an engaging, moving, and important reminder that the strangest worlds are right under our noses. Fast paced, gritty and in your face<br /><br />I loved Rapulana Simpiwe in the lead, a stunning young talent, Jafta Mamabolo who played the young Kunene is fantastic. <br /><br />The script is excellent, reassuringly tight and Carried me effortlessly through the journey. <br /><br />This is the story of how a intelligent kid with the same hopes and dreams as anyone else; an education, work hard, get a degree and live his dreams through legitimate means, succumbs, despite himself, to a life of crime because it is his only course available.<br /><br />It accurately portrays the universal genesis of crime and loss of innocence and righteousness (the symbol of which of course was the mother with her hand pressed tightly on her bible). <br /><br />I don't know what's happening with the film in terms of its international release, but I would sincerely hope that many others will have the memorable experience that we did.
