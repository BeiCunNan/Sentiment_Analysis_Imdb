3 stars out of 10 was the best I could do for this film.<br /><br />It started out rather interesting - this very plain looking young woman seems to live a lonely sort of life with her widowed father in a medium-sized town. I got the impression she longed for romance.<br /><br />She worked at some kind of carnival-like park, where she had to wear a huge rabbit head and rabbit costume, and her boss was kind of a jerk. So this character, Evie Decker, caught my sympathy and interest.<br /><br />Then she hears this guy, named Drumstrings Casey, on the radio, and he's trying to make it as a singer. She becomes quite enthralled with him, to the point of carving his name on her forehead -- all of which was quite intriguing.<br /><br />The film goes downhill from there. There was no interesting story as a follow-up to all this.<br /><br />Evie Decker was played by Lili Taylor - who is pretty enough when she has her hair done and some make-up on - which she very seldom does in this film--but that works for the type of character she is playing. One thing I noticed, that struck me as odd, the peer group Evie hangs out with seem to be in their late teens or early twenties, yet Lili Taylor looks to me like she's kicking thirty or better.<br /><br />Guy Pearce plays Drumstrings Casey--a character who apparently has never been introduced to water, soap, or shampoo. While Evie has hair problems, this guy has obvious hygiene problems. That being the case, it's a bit of a mystery what she sees in him. In addition, he's not very attractive, bearing an unfortunate resemblance to a baboon.
