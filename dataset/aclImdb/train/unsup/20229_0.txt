This movie definitely moved me. It was something that was so amazing to watch that I want to do it. I really believe it to be and great way for people to put their energy to positive and inspiring use. <br /><br />I went to the theater not knowing what to expect. I sat down and began to see all kinds of previews for other black movies. I really thought it was going to be a really cool break dancing movie...but it really was....so much more. I was inspired. I really found it to be an awesome display of what the human body is capable of doing physically. I really did not know 'We' could move like that! It's so, energetic and spiritual. There definitely is something spiritual about the whole thing. You know, spirituality is an individual concept, and people collectively reach it together through group prayer or showing affection or keeping their word or many other ways that if you look deep enough and hard enough you can chose to interpret as spiritual. I saw spirituality in this form of worship. They are worshiping being Alive with Energy! Like it was stated in the movie, it really goes back to their African roots. It's definitely a tribal ritual that has evolved greatly.<br /><br />We all can trace our roots to ancient tribes. We all still have primal instincts in us. We all can learn something from this film.
