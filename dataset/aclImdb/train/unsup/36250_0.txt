Sam Goldwyn did this movie to imitate the Ziegfeld follies and (hopefully) rake in millions. Boy was he WRONG! Adolphe Menjou plays a producer whose movies are failing. He meets sweet, wholesome Andrea Leeds and hires her to be "Miss Humanity" and tell him what the public wants. (No it makes no sense to me either) She tells him all these howlers like "Romeo and Juliet should have a happy ending" and "love is the most important thing". Menjou manages to keep a straight face and says "That's brilliant" to all these pearls of wisdom. One day Leeds goes to a hamburger diner. She walks in to see sweet, wholesome Kenny Baker cooking hamburgers while singing "Love Walked In" (with a full orchestra being heard). Naturally they fall in love. That's when I gave up.<br /><br />Seriously this movie is just unbelievable. The dialogue was full of campy lines and groaningly bad jokes (my eyes hurt from rolling them so much). This movie is full of "speciality" act: Edger Bergman and Charlie McCarthy manage to get out a few good jokes; The Ritz Brothers (a comedy group that makes the Three Stooges look subdued) throw in some "comedy" bits that will have you gaping (in disbelief)--their "pussy cat" song is truly a jaw-dropper; Romeo and Juliet is done as a ballet--with tap-dancing too; there are THREE musical numbers from "La Traviata" worked in; Phil Baker pops up as a seriously untalented accordionist and a LONG dull ballet is shoved in.<br /><br />Acting doesn't help. Menjou manages to keep a straight face; Leeds is given nothing to do but look beautiful and wholesome and Baker is SO nauseatingly sweet that you just want to slap him. Beautiful Technicolor photography doesn't help. This is worth watching just for some nice visuals and the hysterically bad dialogue. Example: "Fill my bath with whipped cream" (????). This falls in the so bad it's good area--but still it's just a 1 all the way.
