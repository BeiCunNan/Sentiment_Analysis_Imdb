Has this movie been directed? Short answer: no.<br /><br />Obviously the director tried, but failed miserably. This is a movie made by consensus and the result is the product of lack of leadership.<br /><br />Worse. The result is an absurd piece of non-art. This movie is so full of mistakes that it's almost (I said almost) a joy to watch. It lacks coherence, probability, it lacks a proper cast, decent movie score, there's horrible editing, plot holes, visual mistakes and everything (I mean everything) seems out of place.<br /><br />One of the most blatant mistakes is the casting. The main actor has the charisma of a shoe. He's supposed to portray a 15 year old but looks ten years older and there's no character development.<br /><br />The story is about a crusade of 8000 children. One question: where are they? All I see is a handful of extra's. I assure you: that's pure ridicule.<br /><br />In one scene there's ships on the sea, the next they're gone. The fighting scenes have the absurdity of monty python. There's daylight scenes with night scenes edit inbetween. I could go on and on.<br /><br />A fifteen year old knows how to make dynamite? Out of bird poop? 13th century children sing Queen's "We Are The Champions"? A mobile phone battery lasting weeks? Three months worth of medicine in a tube the size of a pencil? One boy baking 10,000 breads? In one night? Is there any logic? <br /><br />And I haven't mentioned the biggest problem yet: the marketing. First of all what market? Dutch? German? English speaking European countries? Secondly, who was this intended for? Children (don't think so because of the 9yo age limit). Teens? Doubt it, my grandma tells cooler stories. Bored housewives and -fathers? It's so obvious the producers had no clue what they were making, so they probably aimed it at all of the above.<br /><br />Poor souls.<br /><br />I'm sure they tried. They had meetings. Lots of meetings. They must have discussed everything, leaving the artists empty handed, or worse, "managed".<br /><br />Tell you what, they didn't manage.<br /><br />They failed. Totally.
