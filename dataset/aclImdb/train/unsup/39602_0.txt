I took a chance on this film after reading a couple of intriguing reviews of it. Ultimately, I thought the film was boring, incomprehensible, amateurish, and almost unwatchable. The cinematography and editing are a mess. The story pointless and the direction varies between arty and overdone to dull and sluggish. The acting ranged from passable (by the lead, Duane Jones) to awful (everyone else). This is supposed to be a landmark in black cinema of the 70's? Avoid at all costs!!!
