Most of this movie is the sort of mindless melodrama Hollywood and Paris produced in abundance in the 1930s. The acting is all fine, but the story is strictly from hunger.<br /><br />At the end, however, you get to see Josephine Baker in a major production number, the sort of musical extravaganza that made her a star in Paris. There, for five minutes, you understand that she was a lot more than just a woman in a banana skirt.<br /><br />Watch the rest of the movie if you're into melodrama.<br /><br />But definitely watch the end. It explains the French reputation of Josephine Baker.
