This is a story about gold mines in Alaska & claim jumping. This Rex Beach work was first done as silent movies in 1914, 1923. In 1930, Gary Cooper did it with sound. Then came this 1942 version which during the war took advantage of star power.<br /><br />John Wayne & Marlene Deitrich & Randolph Scott are a love triangle & there is even another woman for Wayne to romance. Scott gets to play the heavy who along with a crooked judge try to ace Wayne & his partner out of their gold mine, The Midas. The other woman in Waynes life is part of the bad guys triangle, trying to lure Wayne into a trap. She utters the title line, "We're just spoilers." While I have not seen the other versions, plus 2 more done later in the 1950's, this one is stronger than your typical western because of the talented cast & the tremendous fist fight scene between Wayne & Scott which takes most of the last 10 minutes of the film.<br /><br />This is the only time that this cast appears together in one film & fans of all three stars have reason to look at this film. It even presents a mild verbal cat fight between Waynes 2 women. Dietrich wins though her hero is pretty badly mauled in the final sequence. She runs a bar-casino in the movie & her tag line is "Anything you can win, you can collect." She says it twice in the movie, & like most movies of this era, you never see the winner collect, it is a stirring part of the imagination.
