They are ruining the whole Batman franchise with this new series. With each story, it seems to be getting worse. What are they trying to do, make a Blade out of Batman. They are going to lose a lot of hardcore Batman fans if they keep continuing with this new series.<br /><br />And what is with this new animation, are they trying to make anime. The only place anime is entertaining is in porn. The animation is not just awful, it is flawed, so is the direction. In one of the scenes, they show vampires as being invisible in the mirror and then they show the Joker's reflection after he turns into a vampire. I hope they will get a grip and get the old series back in action!
