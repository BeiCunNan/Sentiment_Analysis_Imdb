Snoop Dogg has proven that he is a great rapper, but he has yet to prove that he is a great actor. He has proved he is better than the average rapper/actor with his performances in films like TRAINING DAY and BABY BOY, though he's still not what most would consider an actual "actor". Here, he plays Jimmy Bones, a gangster who is killed in 1979 and then years later is awakened and out for revenge against the ones who killed him. Think of it as a goofier, more urban version of THE CROW. However, unlike THE CROW this is a good horror movie. Everything you could want in a horror movie is here: plenty of gore, sex, and there's even a scene with a severed talking head! It's actually a lot better then the trailers make it look. **1/2
