This movie represents the kind of self-righteous pious moralising that renders one quite nauseous. To put this in context, I watch many movies from all parts of the world, and I enjoy slow art house movies as much as fast moving dramas or intelligent action movies. I hired this on DVD, based on positive buzz, and did something I very rarely do with DVD's. After half an hour or so, I could see exactly where this movie was going, and I began to fast forward through the move, reverting to play to observe key plot points. If you fancy being preached to by being beaten over the head by a moral maniac, then you might enjoy this over-rated nonsense. If it were artistic, or intelligent, then I could forgive this movie it's sins. Yet it has the ultimate sin, which I do not often encounter in movies, which usually have something to recommend them, of being rather dull.
