Despite the fact that Mel Gibson is a not-so-great guy as a person, there's no denying that he's a master when it comes to film-making. This movie was not just fast paced and intense, it was visually stunning. The characters are all well developed so we actually care about them (and hate the bad guys). The acting was well done; there weren't any moments that had me rolling my eyes.<br /><br />The only turn-off would be the large amount of bloodshed throughout the movie. Although this doesn't bother me at all, there are a lot of people who will be nauseated by the violence. Among these scenes include people being sacrificed by having their hearts torn out, then being be-headed, and a person being completely torn apart by a Jaguar.<br /><br />The music fits the film extremely well. There's not much of a running theme. It's mostly underscoring; the type of music that keeps the film moving but doesn't completely stand out.<br /><br />There are many cool camera effects, especially the use of slow motion throughout the film. There are also many aerial camera angles, allowing us to see characters in pursuit of each other from the tree-tops.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this film is extremely intense, fast paced, and original. If you are looking for a film experience that you wont soon forget, I completely recommend it. If you have a weak stomach and don't enjoy being on the edge of your seat for 2 hours and 20 minutes, don't see this movie.
