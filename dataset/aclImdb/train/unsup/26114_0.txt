Okay fine the title is a little cheesy but regardless this is one heck of a good movie with a great performance by Gene Hackman. Now what I really found interesting about this movie was that in a way the director and/or writer tried to make a statement by saying that racism is taught. Which I belief is true! There is this great scene where the two agents are viewing a film of a KKK member, unhooded giving a speech while you see little kids walking around dressed like the clan. Interesting huh?<br /><br />3(***)out of 4(****)stars
