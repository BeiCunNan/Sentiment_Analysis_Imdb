Set in the New Mexican Territories at the turn of the century, Pursued is a well made western about Jeb Rand and his struggle against a dark past. Jeb's family disappeared when he was a boy - though he doesn't know how or why. Being raised by the Callum family, Jeb falls in love with Thorley Callum and hopes to start a new life; however, things from his shady past come back and relentlessly pursue him. The film grabs your attention and jumps headfirst into a pool of excitement within the first few minutes - what follows is an interesting and enjoyable story that takes plenty of jaw opening twists and turns throughout the film. Robert Mitchum stars as Jeb and gives a very fine performance that ranks among his most impassioned and very best. Mitchum portrays a smooth toughness and quiet desperation in Jeb, creating a perfect cinematic hero for all to easily rally behind. Teresa Wright also co-stars as the sweet Thorley and Judith Anderson gives a strikingly great performance as 'Ma' Callum. You really don't see westerns as dark as Pursued, cinematographer James Wong Howe really does the film good with his thick shadow-laced picture and wonderfully captured scenery. Director Raoul Walsh orchestrates every tense, tender, and action-packed scene very well and Max Steiner's haunting score kicks the film's mood to high gear. Pursued does have a couple of small hiccups due to some cheesy dialogue, but it is a real good western overall.
