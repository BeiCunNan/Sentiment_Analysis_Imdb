I gave this DVD version of the play a 10 simply for the scene stealing performance by Byron Jennings. He is truly amazing as Beverley Carlton. This is not to be missed by anyone who appreciates uncommonly gifted acting.<br /><br />Nathan Lane as Sheridan Whiteside is the perfect foil for him. His line about the Lindbergh baby is hilarious, and Byron Jennings' reaction is well in tune with Nathan Lane's humor. It's rare to watch actors who are so much in sync with each other. Too often a film or play will feature great talent playing opposite mediocre talent. Speaking of which, the actress who plays Sheridan Whiteside's secretary is not of their caliber and detracts from their performance.<br /><br />The play's greatest weakness is that Mr. Jennings appears in just one scene.<br /><br />Still, it's amazing enough to be worth the cost of purchase.<br /><br />It's so unfortunate that American film and theater productions place greater value on perfectly photogenic looks, rather than exceptional talent. If only film and theater goers were able to recognize and value substance and depth of character, they would be able to look beyond the shallowness and one dimensional "acting" that is foisted on us.
