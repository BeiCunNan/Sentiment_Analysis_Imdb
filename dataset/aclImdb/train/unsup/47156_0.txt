Oh myI can't believe they actually made a film out of this silly theme! I was really wondering whether it would as foolish as the title leads you to suspect. Apparently, you don't need any writing skills if you're working with Albert Band. I know, respect the dead and stuff (Albert Band recently passed away, in 2002) but he and his son Charles made, wrote and produced an awful lot of bad horror and sci-fi films in their lifetimes. Visualize the cheesiest and silliest image that pops up in your head, and you've got an idea what The Hound of Dracula is about! There really is a DOG buried in a coffin with a wooden stick through his heart and he comes to life! He's controlled by a half-ling  a vampire who can stand daylight  and together, they search for the last ascendant of Count Dracula since they need a new master. In short, Veidt Smith is some sort of `Renfield' and he lets his dog do all the dirty work. Hold your breathit becomes even better! They raise a whole army of Vampire dogshow about that?! The Hound of Dracula is filled with bad acting, uninspired twists and lame scenery. Even the killing scenes aren't bloody enough to bother. Most of the time, it just looks like a hilarious comedy or a sadistic spoof but the only problem isthey didn't intend it to be funny! My only respect in this pile of rbage goes out to dogs themselves and to the people who trained them! They did a good job and surely deserved a better screenplay to work with.
