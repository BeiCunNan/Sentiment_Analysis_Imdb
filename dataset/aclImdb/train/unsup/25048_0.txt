I love how I can relate to the main characters. They're all just screwed up enough in the head that I feel like I'm watching my own life on the screen(except my life isn't quite that exciting.) I don't know anybody who couldn't relate to this movie, or find it hilarious! They did a great job on this one. I wanna see more movies like this one. It makes me feel like I'm not as far off as I thought. The main characters put it all on the line. They're like open books. The producers of this one did a great job putting it all on the line for the audience to see. I haven't seen a movie like this since "Kids" and "Clerks". Great job guys!
