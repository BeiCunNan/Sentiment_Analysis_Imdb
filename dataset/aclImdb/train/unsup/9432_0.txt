"No Good Deed" is a way-above-average character driven thriller. The fact that it is based on short story by Dashiell Hammett puts in a class above the rest with a story-line that is frighteningly plausible. Boasting a stellar cast including Samuel L Jackson, Stellan Skasgaard and Milla Jovovich it is highly suspenseful with a cracking script. Stellan Skasgaard delivers his lines with relish and Milla Jovovich is highly believable in her role as a woman who plays all the men against each other. Grace Zabriskie and Joss Ackland steal the show, however, with their portrayals of a thief-couple in their twilight years. All, in all, highly recommended for a nights entertainment for those who like their thrillers a little more cerebral than the norm.
