I saw this film at the Omaha Film Festival where it just won the jury prize for best film and the audience choice award for best film. This film is amazing--a real surprise! This is one of those films that I would have watched 100 times over the summer when I was a kid. Everything about it worked--the performances of the two lead kids, career-making performances from both Stephen Baldwin and Tom Sizemore, great aerial photography and stunt work, an amazing score, etc. There are scenes with both a bully and another with the bully's brother that are awesome. I very rarely get this enthusiastic about a film anymore, but just can't say enough good things about it. Great job, Rocco! I wish you great success and can't wait to see your next film!
