I don't even know where to begin. This movie is just so excruciatingly bad that it's painful for the eyes to look at. And what's worst is the fact that it's a "sequel" to the absolutely brilliant original.

When Jesse finds out about Freddy, he and his girlfriend start investigating... I really want to tell you the ending, so I can save you from this tragedy of a film, but I'll keep my mouth shut. However, if you really want to know, send me an e-mail to phil7225@googlemail.com and I'll send you one back with the ending. But, trust me, you'll wish you never knew...
