It is totally unbelievable films like this are allowed to be made and packaged I'm in total shock, like somebody mentioned here this is not a low budget horror, but a camera prank film, it seemed like everyone was a joke, nobody was an actor, these people are not actors. everybody was a shallow character, all the girls had attitude. and the film looked dull and grainy, the bit where the girl is run over will make you laugh forever, the shocks are ridiculous to the point of needing to by yourself a new television because your current one has just caught a virus. please don't go buy it, and ignore the positive comments about this film because its basically the cast writing reviews about there own shitty film because there out of work. Directors who produce this crap are money making scammers, where is the law against this tripe. look at the acting of the hotel landlady and tell me you don't feel insulted by this rubbish.
