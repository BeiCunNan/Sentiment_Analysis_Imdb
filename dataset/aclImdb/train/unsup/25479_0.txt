The Strange And Deadly Occurrence is one of the best made for television thrillers that you will ever see!When I saw this as a young teenager, my heart was pounding so loud, I thought that I could hear it!I was truly scared, and I turned all of the lights on. I saw this movie recently, and I was just as scared as I was back then. I will not give away the plot. I will say that Robert Stack as the father was terrific. Vera Miles played the mother, and as usual she was wonderful. The sound effects were so good. The constant loud banging in the story scared me more than anything.This is a thriller that the whole family can sit down and watch with no gore or bad language.I highly recommend this movie to people who love to be scared.
