Kornel Mundruczo's "Johanna" is a cinematic mess, "full of sound and fury,/Signifying nothing." With its garish (green) colours and flared images, a mediocre score and lame libretto, the film is well below par. It would be generous to say this film looks more like a bloated, experimental undergraduate student film from the 1970's. Set aside films such as Ingmar Bergman's acclaimed "The Magic Flute" (1975), Joseph Losey's version of Mozart's "Don Giovanni" (1979)," Carlos Saura's flamenco "Carmen" (1983), and Francesco Rosi's 1984 production of the same material, lead by a cast of international opera stars, as being too mainstream and conventional. Mundruczo's "Johanna", supposedly a retelling of the story of Joan of Arc, is lurid and dimwitted. It is the sort of film to which the jaded cinematic "cognoscenti" ascribe all manner of praise for its director's brave vision and deep meaning, but don't be fooled. I watched the entire film, but I'd suggest that you don't. You'll be checking your watch after ten minutes, thinking an hour has passed, wondering if your time would be better spent doing something else. It would.
