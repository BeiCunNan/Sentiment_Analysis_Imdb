When I've seen Brat, I thought it was pretty silly. I just didn't like it. Though this spring we got another part of Danila's (this cute lovely guy) adventures. I thought this would not be better, so I haven't seen it... But recently we had it on the TV and I just watched it, because I heard people liked it. So I did. And I must tell ya that this is good done job. I don't even know what is so amazing there for me. Maybe I just liked the idea, because it really seemed great. And all those jokes. Damn, only Russians can understand it (well, the movie is Russian. For us.). One Bagrov-older bro (Sukhorukov) is big joke. I mean, almost everything he says is funny. No, you better know what the joke is about... Oh, yeah, forgot: maybe Americans don't like it. But don't they always make Russians "monsters that are going to destroy the world" in the movies? We have our own opinion, so sorry, guys! :))
