I thought "That 80's Show" was a very funny sitcom. The cast fit in perfectly and were hilarious. I think people didn't really like that show because they kept hoping that it would be the same characters of "That 70's Show". If people would watch it again, (without thinking of 70's show), they would probably enjoy it. That 80's show was put on the air too soon. They should have waited a bit longer to put it out there. But it was very funny. If that show would go back on the air, it would probably have better ratings than before. Now that "That 70's Show" is no longer running, they should bring back 80's. Viewers were just loyal to their "70's show" and took 80's show as a threat. I loved that 70's show and was unhappy to see it end. But shows have end some time! I really think that 80's show would do better this time around. Viewers just have to give it a chance and get that 70's show off their minds while watching it. After all, it was a different show, they can't all be the same.
