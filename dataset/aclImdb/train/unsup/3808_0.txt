I knew this was going to be bad. I expected it from the minute I picked up the box, turned around and looked at the screen caps and couldn't stop laughing at the dated looking teenagers.<br /><br />What the heck was Yaphet Koto and Edward Albert doing in this 'Wargames' rip-off? The story of a bunch of teens who spend the weekend in a secluded cabin in the woods hacking into an on-line video game called 'Terminal Entry.' Although, they hadn't figured out that it's not a game at all, but terrorists actually using the interface to carry out their hijacking of the American communications system (there only seems to be one that they're after) and are using the game to carry out their assassination plots.<br /><br />It's is a terrible, achingly boring movie that is so slow movie. The action scenes are pathetic, the dialog is stupid. You can immediately sense how lame this movie will be from the very beginning when the model is showering nude (why are people always so happy when they shower in the movies?) in full make-up or when Yaphet Koto is being shot at in his helicopter by ground terrorists, and doesn't seem the least bit bothered by the fuselage of gunfire. Edward Albert plays the hardened, five-foot soldier who takes it upon himself to single-handedly kill the terrorists. It's his mission.<br /><br />Two stars because hottie Patrick Labyroteaux actually adds a bit of humor.<br /><br />Do yourself a big favor, pocket the cash and time you would spend watching this mess and do something else.
