Merle Oberson, rich San Francisco socialite, goes out for a nightcap at a jazz joint after a classical concert and flips over pianist Dana Andrews in Hoagy Carmichael's combo. Being a rich gal, she usually gets what she wants, but Andrews gives her the air. He's blind so the beautiful Ms. Oberson's charms don't impress him a mite.<br /><br />She talks it over with Carmichael and our boy Dana is a musical genius, but the blindness has left him bitter. So in order to help him find his muse, she pretends she's blind.<br /><br />Now if that don't sound like the silliest romantic plot you ever heard, you haven't seen too many old Hollywood classics. Andrews and Oberon looked downright embarrassed as did Ethel Barrymore playing Oberon's aunt.<br /><br />But the film has the saving grace of the abundantly talented Hoagy Carmichael. The highlight of the film is him singing and playing his song, Who Killed the Black Widow. Now that was muse well worth finding.
