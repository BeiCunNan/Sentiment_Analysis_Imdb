There were so many goofs in this movie. I only watched it once, and I still ask myself why I did. For starters, Jordan never had an afro in college. In the pros, he did not go bald until about 1989, but they had him bald as a rookie. Also as a rookie, which was 1984, I know those shoes were from the 1995 or 1996 season. I also did not understand the locations of certain scenes. I know that the scenes of the Bulls home games were filmed in what looked like the L.A. Sports Arena, where the Clippers used to play. And what's with the zero for players with single digit numbers. For example, John Paxson was number 05. And the actors could not look less like the real people. Robin Givens as Juanita? Juanita is not that dark, and Debbie Allen does not look like his mom. Also, Phil Jackson is about 6-8 and Michael Jace was taller than the guy that played Jackson. There were so many things wrong with this movie, I'm glad the only evidence it was ever made is this website.
