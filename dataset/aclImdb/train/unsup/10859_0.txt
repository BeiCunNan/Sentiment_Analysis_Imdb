A true Classic, of 1970's Cinema, and some!<br /><br />That is the best way that I can begin to describe this, one of my all-time favorite Movies.<br /><br />Once again, I first saw this Movie on my Mum and Dad's old Phillips V2000, when it was first released onto the U.K's Home Cinema market (hired from a seedy old Video rental shop on the Woolworth road), and boy did it leave it's mark!<br /><br />In short, I LOVE THIS MOVIE!<br /><br />O.k. At times the story, does tend to plod along at an almost snail's pace. But this is really a small price to pay for the Film's wonderfully inspired set pieces. Which, when they come, seem to hit you with the force of a speeding freight-train! In fact, just writing this review makes the hairs on the back of my neck tingle! As I remember each, and everyone of them. With such crystal clear clarity, that you would think I had only just finished watching the Film, for the umpteenth time! Truth is, it has now been about a year, since I last saw it!<br /><br />Boy, doesn't time fly, when you're having fun!<br /><br />If you've seen this Film before, no doubt, you'll have your own views on it, and so don't need me to tell you how good/bad it is!<br /><br />However, if you haven't...<br /><br />Trust me, when I say that this Film is a Classic, of the HIGHEST magnitude, and that it would be an absolute crime for you not to see it!
