OK, I just saw this crap on German TV. I expected a mindless and moderately funny comedy, kind of perfect after a hard days work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie isn't even unintentionally funny. You can't even laugh about how bad it is, because the repetitive 'gags', the randomly stuck together scenes and the dialogues are just plain dull. Boring. I laughed exactly four times throughout the whole movie, which is a rather bad quote for a comedy.<br /><br />The main problem is that although the imitations of the original movies are rather well executed and the famous-actor-look-alikes really look similar to their counterparts, the directors somehow confused simple references to famous movies with being funny. Their interpretation of a gag consists mainly of people/animals getting hit, preferably in the crotch. Gets pretty dull after the, erm, 20th time? In conclusion, the movie is so boring it's not even worth watching it for making fun of it. Doesn't work, just a wast of time. Really.<br /><br />PS: As this movie was a box-office success (!), expect more of this crap in near future. Which probably will become another success due to a huge marketing campaign... Idiocracy coming to life?!
