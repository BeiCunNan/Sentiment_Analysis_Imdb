As a veteran filmmaker and critic, it's pretty obvious to me that this film was produced by narcissistic, pot-smoking dingbats with minimum knowledge of film and film-making. They take a subject, who most people have never even heard of or care about, and produce a documentary that completely falls flat on its face. The simple reality of the matter is that Fischer is just another non-conforming, dead head, bohemian, pseudo-iconoclast who isn't even worth learning about. These "dudes," who probably just graduated from Tisch, treat him like he is the greatest thing since sliced bread just cause his multiple personality disorder somehow gave him the vision to perpetuate complete excrement, which is considered to be artistic mastery by his cult following. I went to college with people like this too - they were usually the ones role playing to dungeons and dragons while smoking hash on a Saturday night with the dead playing in the background. Congratulations to the Ubin Twinz - can't wait to see what they churn out next.
