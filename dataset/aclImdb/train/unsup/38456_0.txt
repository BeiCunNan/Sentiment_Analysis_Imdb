which felt like 10 hours. this is one of the most stupid and horrible movies i could ever imagine sitting through. i watched at a film festival and me and my friends felt like leaving but we didn't want to hurt the director's feelings, who was sitting right there. i pride myself in avoiding crap when i go to the movies, i don't watch blockbusters or lame comedies with former SNL comedians, but this movie falls right in there with the worst of the worst. avoid it, run, go do something useful, even eating french fries would be more productive. this movie is full of holes, bad dialogue and run of the mill bad acting. i wonder how the producers conned these actors into working in this movie either that, or they accepted because they were too lazy to read the script there is nothing redeemable about this movie, take my word for it.
