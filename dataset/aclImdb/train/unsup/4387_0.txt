I saw WWHTKB pretty soon after production finished. I loved it because of its quirky comedy and "clerksy" feel. I have seen it 3 times since, a few different edits and I like it more and more each time. This movies is funny and enjoyable with a plot like I have never heard of before! Definitely unique in its theme, WWHTKB is the type of movie that everyone can watch and enjoy no matter what your movie preference is. There is a character for everyone to relate to and the acting is great. My personal favorite character was Eugene, he was absolutely hilarious! And the scene in the movie theater is one to leave quite a memory. Oberall it was a great movie, one that I am looking for ward to seeing again and again. I can't wait to be able to own a copy of my very own!
