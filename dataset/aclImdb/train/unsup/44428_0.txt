This film has to be a candidate for scariest of the century. I felt truly overwhelmed with fear throughout this gut wrenching horror. The special effects were exemplary and really brought the film alive - at one point, where one of the ghosts from the lake kills an innocent picnicker with a ferocious blow over the head, I almost went over and wiped the blood from the screen as blood splattered over the camera lens. One of my friends said it looked unreal and like it had been drawn onto the tape with felt tip, but it sure had me fooled. Also, the use of Vaseline on the dead (or undead?) bodies really gave me the creeps - I've always been paranoid about getting near the stuff! The film was directed with true talent and precision - all the shots were called right and the camera transitions were just great - it really took me back to the seventies! The running scenes were a work of art, the actors choosing to jog rather than run from their attackers as they were gripped with too much fear to use their legs properly.<br /><br />The acting is some of the best I have seen in years and I'm really surprised that none of the actors received any Oscars after these convincing, truly inspirational performances.<br /><br />Overall, I thought the film was a worthy addition to gleaming hall of horror fame - a real gore treat that will leave you bricking it!
