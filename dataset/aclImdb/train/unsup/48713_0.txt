There are three reasons for seeing this movie. Diana Rigg, Judi Dench and Judi Dench's miniscule costume. What a hot li'l pixie she was thirty years ago! She wears body paint nicely.<br /><br />Other than that, we are treated to one of the least funny adaptations of a Shakespearean comedy I've ever seen. The director is far more interested in having the actors talk to the camera than each other. The Focus is on The Words, which would be fine for a radio adaptation, but it makes for a snooze of a movie.<br /><br />The Kevin Kline/Michelle Pfeiffer version was better... and I didn't like *that*. Maybe this is just too delicate a comedy for the movies and needs to be seen live to be appreciated.<br /><br />But Judi Dench... WOW! There is nothin' like a Dame.
