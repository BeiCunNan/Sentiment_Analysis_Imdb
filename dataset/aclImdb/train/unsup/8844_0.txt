I love all three of these women, they are stunning actresses, just beyond beautiful. But this series has no story anyone could possibly want to watch. Their lives have no more relation to the real world than fairy tales do. It is not just that frequent contrivances jar the viewer, it is that every aspect of their lives and every situation they face is contrived. This show cannot replicate the success of Sex in the City because part of what made that series work was its originality, and you can't repeat originality.<br /><br />The show makes the mistake of carrying over Sex and the City's obsession with wealth and fame, but taking it up several notches. What the producers missed is that this obsession was never one of S&C's draws; it was not the reason people tuned in. Every time some new boyfriend on S&C was described at the most famous blabla or the leading blabla or the most powerful blabla in the widget industry the show lost its footing, but for the obliviousness of its audience of American women who cannot discern logic from nonsense.<br /><br />In LJ, it is not only the boyfriends of the week who are plutonian overlords, it is the women themselves. I have no objection to a story about the most wealthy, powerful women on earth, but I don't think such a story can work as a series. I don't think you can do an entire series about them, and you can't put them in those roles and still try to make them just nice, hard-working underdogs just trying to get by.
