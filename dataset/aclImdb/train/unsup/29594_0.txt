Don't bother to check epinions-they haven't heard of it. The Enoch Powell episode is dated, and as it turns out, fatuous (declaration of interest: some of us are erecting a statue with the epitaph: He was right); same goes for the Rebrick University episode. I recommend FF or eject on both (I haven't checked whether these episodes have any other plot in them..)<br /><br />Adam seems overly concerned w. religion (maybe this follows Fred's life)-I was at Cambridge at that time & don't recall the slightest mention of the subject, other than mild criticism of the Billy Graham campaign. <br /><br />Angela Down is so endearing in her 2 episodes that she really deserved star billing. The idea of a racing sculling boat at the Orchard is unthinkable. I don;'t remember seeing many Undergrad gowns (compulsory after dark) - maybe I missed them, or possibly they thought it would confuse American viewers..
