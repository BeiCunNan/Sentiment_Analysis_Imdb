This is a very funny film with the common theme of a group of guys going to Vegas for a bachelor party, where they have a series of hilarious misadvantures. There are a lot of funny jokes and the multi-cultural cast meshes very well. All of the actors give good performances & the main characters are well-developed.<br /><br />True to other bachelor party films, the bachelor is constantly resisting temptation. Where this film gets interesting is that it takes a number of surprising turns, where they fear for their lives and end hot water with the law. There is a surpising twist at the end which is a nice change from other bachelor party films (although the original "Bachelor Party" always will be king).<br /><br />I'm sure one of the reasons this movie did not make it to the theatres is because some of it is kind of raunchy and there are a lot of nudity and sex scenes. I'm surprised it didn't get a NC-17 rating. Still, despite all the raunchiness, there is a kind of innocence to the movie and the characters. It's definitely worth checking out for some laughs and a fun adventure.
