Jeff Ltd is only limited in its own ability to make its viewers laugh or pay attention.<br /><br />This show is one of the worst travesties ever put on the air.<br /><br />Even by comedy network standards it is pretty much garbage and whoever put it on TV should be immediately fired.<br /><br />The main character is annoying and not likable but also doesn't serve to make anyone laugh even once, it is just not a funny show or funny main character. The other characters also are not funny in the least.<br /><br />Also the guy playing the main Jeff character can't act worth garbage so that's another reason to cancel this travesty.<br /><br />Jeff Ltd is total garbage that could only make the worst and least intelligent people laugh.
