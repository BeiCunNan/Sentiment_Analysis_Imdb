I watched this film last night and I must say that straight away it was a cheap nasty film. No one in it could act and the music was crap. Becky went on a like a cheap blonde slut. There was far too many mistakes in the film that I was really lost half way through watching it. I couldn't understand how the little girl went missing in the lake in 1967 (She is on the newspaper) and her twin was the same age in this film??. They say that the ghosts attack every 13 years starting from 1928. So it would go 1928, 1941, 1954, 1967, 1980, 1993, 2006. If this film was set in 2004 then the ghosts would not be attacking! Even in the library there was only Becky the librarian and the little girl but then you see someone playing with the doll house! I thought the special effects were crap as well for its age. I'm wondering if it was just students making this film!
