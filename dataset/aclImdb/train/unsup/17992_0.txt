I saw this movie about 15 years ago. It has stayed with me ever since.<br /><br />I specifically joined IMDb, for the sole pleasure of bitching about this film. Well this film and Battlefield Earth, which by comparison is a marvel of cinematographic brilliance.<br /><br />My brother (Gary who will never be forgiven for this.) chose this film and we saw it with friends. It has become our benchmark for how completely rubbish a film can be. <br /><br />After 15 years I still feel I was unfairly robbed of 1.5 hours of my life. We sat there staring in disbelief like rabbits staring into an oncoming cars headlights, instead trusting our instincts and turning it off after the first 5 minutes.<br /><br />My comments above show more plot and character development and generally a better story line that this film. This film should win any contest for bad taste gift. Should only be bought as a gift for people you don't like. (Assuming anyone was optimistic (stupid) enough to think that anyone would want to buy it.).<br /><br />Utterly utterly cr#p. I'm p1ssed that I can't give it a zero or a minus score. Did I mention this was all time worst film I have ever seen? I have enjoyed TV commercials more than this film.<br /><br />This film truly deserves legendary status.
