The best movie i have seen in a long long long time.. <br /><br />The movie is loosely based on the gujarat riots and the machinations thereof..i.e the complicit role of the chief minister of the state with communal elements and collusion of the police force with the rioters ..But it is an extremely balanced look at the communal politics behind riots in India, with elements in both communities inciting such events for their own personal gains.. <br /><br />What can i say about Mr Bachhan, the more i see this man on screen, the more awestruck i am. He is perfectly cast as an honest cop, battling the system( reminiscent of khakee) except as he himself said, this movie is an implosion rather than an explosion. He doesn't go out in a blaze of glory taking down the bad guys with him.. Thats what makes this movie so startlingly different.<br /><br />Om puri is an ideal foil as the morally bankrupt but conflicted cop who is friends with mr bacchans character. he is such a great actor..<br /><br />Kareena is amazing .. she looks and acts "real" in an almost irridescent manner, and not like an overmade up glam doll .. the look suits her so well. she has immense guts to take on this role and i commend her for that.<br /><br />Fardeen was nothing special..but the kareena fardeen scenes exude chemistry .<br /><br />Direction was superb..Govid Nihalani excels as usual .
