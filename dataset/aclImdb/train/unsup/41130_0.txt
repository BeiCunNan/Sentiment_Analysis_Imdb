But I hate the new ones. They're getting worse and worse every time and I wish they'll take this show off the air. Not only did it show a homosexuality theme once or twice (i.e: When Patrick and Spongebob raised the clam) but it showed something I'll never forget...pantie raiding. What children's cartoon goes around and raids underwear drawers? WHO, I ASK?! No one except Spongebob. It was a terrible scene and I stopped watching the show right then.<br /><br />And then, there was the episode where Spongebob and whats-his-face were cursing and it wasn't revealed. I wouldn't care if it was. It's sending the wrong message to kids and that's why I am forced to rate Spongebob THE worst show for kids on television.<br /><br />Bring on the hate mail!
