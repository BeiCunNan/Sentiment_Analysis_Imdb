I understand that this was a project for school! The guy responsible had hired the same team from "Once a thief" for the pyrotechnics. To bad it doesn't show! I liked Max Payne and Max Payne 2! But Max Payne:Hero misses the point! Max Payne isn't a hero! He is actually a cop who went rogue and therefore becoming a criminal himself! Yes, we root for him, yeah we like being him,we love the extravaganza shootouts,but to call Max Payne a hero is wrong! So the use of the song "Hero" doesn't belong! This project also is meant as a homage to John Woo (which Max Payne is based on)! This doesn't show! First I thought this was some kind of parody,with the people shooting at boxes and not hitting the main character! After viewing the flashback I have to assume everything is meant to be seriously! The movie looked like it was made by professionals! But overall it fails and is not enjoyable! Next time better!
