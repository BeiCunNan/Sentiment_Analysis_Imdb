Lovely animated film, we loved it as children! It includes both some really sad moments (including the death of sympathetic characters - a topic rarely treated in children's films), but also some funny ones, like the hilarious scene where the two geese get drunk or the scenes that feature the two stupid dogs. It is a nice, moving, often funny, sometimes serious story both children and adults can well relate to. I would recommend it to anyone interested in "non-Disney" animated movies.
