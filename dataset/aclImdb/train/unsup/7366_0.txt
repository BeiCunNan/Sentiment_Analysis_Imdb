This film is a Great movie with real good plot that is continuous and keeps you involved. Its a good family film that you can take you kids too and adults will enjoy as well. There isn't much in the film that would justify a PG-13 rating and it appeals to adolescents, teenager's, and little kids will enjoy it as well. This will be a hit when it gets released soon as it is a feel good film. I saw this film preleased a couple of years ago on a Mexico cruise in the ships main theater. THere aren't a lot of good films these days like there were 20-30 years ago. Rocco did a good job thinking out his plot and story line and is a undiscovered talent that good make it big if he can get his films noticed.
