This is utter crap. There is no two ways about it. The comedy is not funny the acting is horrible and the girls don't get naked enough to make up for the horrible everything else.<br /><br />PLOT: a geeky thin college kid on scholarship needs to sell 50 pills in one day or he's totally in big trouble. A variety of totally unbelievable and unfunny scenes follow this is an incredibly boring and tired movie that uses a lot of recycled see it coming a mile away jokes.<br /><br />LAME.<br /><br />The dominatrix was a nice touch but not anywhere near enough to save this complete train wreck.<br /><br />Don't bother.<br /><br />As I said- see a movie that IS funny and WORTH WATCHING with basically the same plot- see "GO" from 1999
