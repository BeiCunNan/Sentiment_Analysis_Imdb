So, we already have a summary of the show. I suppose it is a good thing that we are learning about different lifestyles. ???Maybe? However, I just do not understand how any self respecting woman would allow this. I am almost able to stomach this family, they do seem normal besides the whole multiple wives thing, however, a third wife? How "hot" does this guy think he is? (By the way, he's not). It is a confusing show because all of the adults are claiming "true love", and that Brian is all of their "soulmates", but I find it hard to grasp how a woman can settle for only a part of that man's love, and part of his attention. This show doesn't seem like it is supposed to educate the world about polygamy, but more about Brian's "stresses", and how he's going to "handle" all these women that are "so desperate" for him. All of the women in the show seem very nurturing and kind, yet brainwashed by Brian. Basically, it totally blows.
