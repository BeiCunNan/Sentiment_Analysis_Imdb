This movie is definitely the worst bring it on movies made, maybe the worst movie of the year.The Concept is stupid, with a bad lead actress {Anne Judson-Yager}. She cannot act in anyway possible. And maybe if they put a better person to play her part, the movie might have got a second star. But to my opinion,the movie isn't even worth half of a star. The plot is pointless, the way some of the actors {Anne Judson-Yager} cheer is very annoying.I'd rather watch a blank screen for days then watch this movie for even five minutes. And i know i'm speaking for a lot of people when i say this movie is horrible and should never be played on t.v for the rest of eternity.
