This is the second best game ever only beaten by Final Fantasy VII me and my brother disagree now again he thinks that Final Fantasy VII is the best game ever which I agree with on some points but, the ending for this game is the best.<br /><br />I downloaded the end because I still havent got there yet im at the first battle for the 4th disc.<br /><br />The main story is about war surround by a love story between Rinoa and Squall (Rinoa has txhe best outfit in the game) Seifer is also a good character. the good thing about this game is that there are more female characters the Final Fantasy VII and the baddies are woman (Seifer inst classed as a bad guy because he redeems himself at the end of the game)<br /><br />The FMV sequences are a lot more advanced than Final Fantasy VII and the detail is much greater. The end sequence looks like the best in the game and I own Final Fantasy IX and I am half way throgh disc one of four and I have found this one of the more boring games the FMV's are even better than this game but there is no story.<br /><br />Squall reminds you of Cloud and Rinoa reminds you of Aeris because of the way they are to each other and you can tell that they are desined to be together. I think that Seplhie and Irvine should end up together and that Seifer and Quistis should end up together and then Zell could end up with the girl that like him from the library which is a side storyline which is good and gives you the chance to get to know more about the chracters and what they like.<br /><br />Another good scene is the dance after Squall passes his final exam to get into SEED. He damces with Rinoa and is terrible until he looks into her eyes which is quite sweet. The look she gives oone couple who bump into them when they dance is funny.<br /><br />Laguna and Raine have a very short but sweet relationship and you feel sorry for him in the end sequence because he still misses her a lot and they were married and are the parents of Squall.<br /><br />So to sum up Final Fantasy VII and VIII are by far the best RPG games ever made and they beat each other in different ways this game wins by FMV sequences and the love story that ends happy unlike Cloud and Aeris. The ending is the one of the best parts of the game and quite long and you feel sorry for Squall when you see him cry and Rinoa cries when she sees him. But the very scene of the game sees the two of them finally sharing a loving kiss and you get to see Seifer laugh and Edea happy with Cid and the rest of the gang having a laugh with each other and Zell stuffing his face full of food and ends up choking and having to be saved by Selphie and Quistis.
