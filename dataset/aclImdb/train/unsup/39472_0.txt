This film is about when 4 teens (Wes, Shaun, Ritch and Lauren) go wild after they graduate from high school, brake into private property, and kill a grizzly cub whose mother goes on rage to kill them. The film includes bad actors, goofs, and the toxic junk shouldn't even be in it. I gave it two because I gave it a little credit and at least all the bad actors died! I wish I could go back in time and never watched this rip-off. I mean, bears don't live in that territory, 3 branches will not hold a car, and fake blood splatters isn't going to make it better. Plus, at least a woman got a contraption in her back for bad acting! Plus, this is the first movie I've seen that before the credits, it says the title again. My rating: D- So don't waste your life on this junk like I did, it is also possibly the top ten boringest film I have ever seen! Plus, the dialog is boring and pointless. Don't watch this boring junk.
