This is a movie without use. The title tells all: Translate into English (any continental variety)...it means something very close to<br /><br />"...The Giant Big."<br /><br />The film itself is worse. How, exactly, did the "creators" imagine the repeated use of the same shots would be un-noticed? How, exactly, did the "director" expect his audience wouldn't notice repeated reverse shots from lines earlier in the film? etc. etc.<br /><br />Don't buy. Don't rent. Don't steal.<br /><br />Ignore it.<br /><br />Maybe the glaciers will grind it to dust.
