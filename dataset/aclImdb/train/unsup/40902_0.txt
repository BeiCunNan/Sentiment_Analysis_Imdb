I love cheesey ninja movies. I LOVE them. The title lured me in, and the movie preceded to take away my will to live.<br /><br />The first twenty minutes of this movie are solid gold. Cinematic trash at its very best. However somewhere in between the feuding twin brothers who also happen to be spies and the repeated sequences of bondage sex and violent rape, this movie made me want to die.<br /><br />Imagine three of the least interesting and most melodramatic plots you can concieve, and then cram them into one movie that manages to bore, confuse and disturb all who view it, and there you have it. Nothing in this movie makes sense. Forget being believable, i couldn't UNDERSTAND it enough to pass judgment on that. I felt as if i had been drugged and then subjected to several hours of beatings and disorientation. The movie was only ninety minutes long, but i swear the hands on the clock stood still as this abomination continued to unfurl its tenticles on my mind. I will never forgive the makers of this sin.
