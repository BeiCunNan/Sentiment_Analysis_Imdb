This is Uma Thurman's first movie. She plays a 20-something living in the East Village who goes home with men, drugs them, and steals their valuables. Then someone starts stalking her. That's really all there is here. This movie is boring, ugly, and poorly made. It isn't scary or creepy or anything. You know who the stalker is straight away because of the spoiler-ish movie title. Uma does an okay job, but her character is so boring and unlikeable that you could care less if she's being stalked. I suppose if you are an obsessive Uma fan, you might want to check this out. Oh, and Steve Buscemi is in one scene. File this under "horror flicks with random and non-sensical rabbit scenes." My Rating: 2/10
