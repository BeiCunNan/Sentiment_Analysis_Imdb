While surfing through the IMDB, I stumbled upon the page for The Secret of the Sword. I hadn't seen it in years, and, based on the glowing comments posted on the page, I had to see it for myself. And, in all honesty, this movie is awful. The plot was paper-thin, the characterization non-existent, and the direction was muddled. The animation was truly horrible, even by TV standards (and to think this was released theatrically!). Sure the characters look good, but they move badly. Plus the same stock footage gets used over and over and over. The voice characterization was terrible, and the evil was pretty cartoony. This movie is a sad reminder of just how far animation had fallen in the 80's.
