Although the critics may have been wishy-washy when reviewing this film, I had only one word going through my mind while watching it: brilliant. This movie was excellently written, and outstanding performances were turned in by many of the performers. The most amazing of which was Oliver Platt's. His portrayal of a mafia muscle man who is really a good guy at heart was both comedic and memorable.<br /><br />The story itself did a good job of showing all the aspects of its protagonist's chaotic life. Each of these aspects developed humorously and nicely (except his relationship with Bullock's character seemed to begin abruptly), and were tied together for the film's climax.<br /><br />All in all, Gun Shy is probably the first good comedy of the year 2000 (which is not the new millenium, that starts in 2001).
