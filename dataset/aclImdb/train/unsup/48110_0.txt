To me this movie is quite unique in a special way. I bought it about a year ago as it seemed "interesting" and I had wanted to see it for some time. Twice have I tried to watch it without being able to finish it...and I hardly ever do this no matter how bad a movie gets. And this is the peculiar part because Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not the worst movie I've "seen". My experience has been this (twice): I start watching it and it's hilarious for about half an hour. Then it flattens out. It doesn't change after this half hour, it just gets old really fast and I get the feeling that it's not moving forward. After about an hour it's like "enough already - get on with it!" and "OK OK - I know now that you have a lot of different drugs with different effects, will anything actually happen soon?". The acting is good, and Depp is...well he's different than how you usually see him, and yet the same - he always gets a part in those mystical movies. I'm actually close to being a Depp fan, but I'm sorry to say that I still haven't been able to keep this movie rolling to the end, or at least I can't remember an end to it. My advice is to see for yourself. The movie is unique to say the least. Helge
