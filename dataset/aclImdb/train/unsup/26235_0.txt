See the story of three strangers as they cruise the Atlantic and remember what it's like to fall in love.<br /><br />The first stars Kirk Douglas as a circus artist. A little slow for me.<br /><br />The second has James Mason as a harsh ballet choreographer. Will he choose love over his career?<br /><br />The third sees a pre-Tom Hanks Big really get to the heart of the matter. It's my personal favourite. Leslie Caron is a born romantic who falters having to teach a precocious brat. This one leaves you with a warm heart.<br /><br />Rent (or buy) this but skip the circus story. The other two will cheer up the hardest viewer. Don't expect Hollywood all the way. It's got enough of a European flair to keep it interesting without making it heavy or difficult to follow.<br /><br />Enjoy.
