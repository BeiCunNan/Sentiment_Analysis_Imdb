Arc started very slowly, with the look of a pretty typical drug-life low budget indie movie. Something to watch with half an eye while going through the paperwork. Then it started to pull me in. Somewhere along the way I stopped working through the accounts and became glued to the screen. Sure it has a few clich√©d set pieces and a few moments of wooden acting, but after the first 30 minutes or so it pans out to be a nicely put together movie. I'm giving it an 8 based on the way that it managed to involve me in the characters and the story. Don't expect any fabulous Hollywood sets, this obviously hasn't got a huge production budget, but the story arc is well done and satisfying. For some reason it reminded me a bit of Running Scared. Worth watching.
