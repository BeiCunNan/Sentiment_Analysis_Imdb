From trawling on the internet, I've discovered that there were 5 series of playing the field, of which I've seen the first 4. Series 5 was never released and I can't remember what happened in it from watching it on TV. Does anyone else know?! This was a good show, if a little predictable in places and some of the characters were slightly miserable! My favourite storyline was probably the Geraldine/Dave/Rick one, which, as I can't remember series 5 (and will never see it again unless it's released - hint hint!) I don't know the conclusion! This storyline lasted over all of the series so would have come to a really good ending - if only I could remember it! It doesn't make any sense to me to release the first four series and not the fifth - someone please take note!!!
