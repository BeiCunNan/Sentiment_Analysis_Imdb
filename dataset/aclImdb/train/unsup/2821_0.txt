I think it is unusual that while the other great film of this kind of style, The Silence of the Lambs, won the main 5 Oscars, Se7en received only 1 nomination and no wins. While Silence of the Lambs is obviously a great film and is more thrilling than Se7en, I just find Se7en so much more interesting. Enough comparison, heres why I think Se7en is one of the best films ever made.<br /><br />David Fincher doesn't show you any of the bizarre killings during the film, instead showing viewers the crime scenes and photographs. This gets you really involved in the film, as you form your own gritty mental images of what has happened. The script is fantastic, the murders are bizarre yet ingenious. The killer is a fascinating character. Kevin Spacey asked not to be credited for his role, as he thought people would not be concentrating on the film properly and waiting for him to appear. His performance, although relatively brief, is every bit as good as Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt.<br /><br />The setting David Fincher has used for his unnamed metropolis is excellent, using shadows, dark lighting and narrow alleys to create a dark and dingy place where evil lurks, the perfect setting for this storyline to unfold.<br /><br />The twist ending is fantastic. Along with Fincher's other masterpiece Fight Club, the twist gives it an extra edge and makes the film better. Se7en is by no means a horror film, but the gruesome visuals and especially the ending make it actually scarier than most horror films.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend your first viewing of Se7en to be 2am in the morning like mine, but any other time I would recommend it as strongly as any other film. 10/10
