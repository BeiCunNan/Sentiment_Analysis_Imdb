Reality TV hit a new low with this offensive crap of a show. Why anyone thought the Gotti family should be treated like stars is beyond me. They are nothing but a bunch of scumbags who came from an even bigger scumbag John Gotti. John Gotti got what he deserved and should have gotten the gallows but at least he was taken off the streets and put in a cage like the wild animal he was. So to make this show is not about Victoria Gotti and her 3 punk kids but rather its a form of a celebration of John Gotti's life. I mean hey look at the nice home Victoria has. That all came from blood money on the hands of her scumbag of a father. Is she willing to give that up after knowing this? I don't think so because she is in a sense a gangster herself. The producers of this show should offer an apology.
