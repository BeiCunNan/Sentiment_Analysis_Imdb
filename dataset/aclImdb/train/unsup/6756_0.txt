This movie blew. Aside from starring the worst actors in the history of movie making, the "plot" was mind numbingly blas√©, the dialogue painfully cringe inducing, and Mariel Hemingway's performance bad enough to make her poor grandfather vomit on himself in his grave. This movie was so bad, yet I could not stop watching it; much like a train wreck in which bodies are flying in all directions. I'm so glad that Mariel Hemingway has chosen yet another steaming piece of pony loaf to showcase her criminal lack of talent. The fact that a reputable production company actually financed and tagged this ridiculous wannabe edgy yet flaccid "statement" about bisexuality made me want to stick a fork into my retina and twist it around repeatedly. In fact, I wish I had done that instead of wasting my time with this ridiculous movie.
