The funny teaming of Carl Reiner and Steve Martin after The Jerk(1979), brought you a funny send up of private eye films of the 1940's, but instead of it being just a simple spoof, the filmmakers went further, on having old film footage of great actors like Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Alan Ladd, and Humphrey Bogart for Steve Martin to play off of. The results is a funny mystery, I like the way it was in black and white, it blends in well with the old footage. It begins with detective Rigby Reardon(The always funny Steve Martin), is hired by Juliet Forrest(The gorgeous and talented Rachel Ward) to solve the mysterious death of her father, Reardon starts to investigate, but will he get into deep? A classic comedy for years to enjoy, Steve Martin and the old film footage blends in well together, it almost looks real. Steve Martin is funny, even when moments he's not trying to hard to be funny, he's even funnier. So is Rachel Ward, she's enjoyable to watch, even when she plays off Martin So We'll. If you are in the mood for a comedy classic with Steve Martin, then go out and rent Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid.
