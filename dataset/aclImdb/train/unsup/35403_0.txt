I just saw the uncut softcore version, from 1974 of this "recommended" horror movie and was amazed how miserable it was. The acting was bad, the english dubbing was the worst I have seen, the gore was unrealistic, and the plot was stupid. The film was just boring from start to end.<br /><br />If something should be called "Euro-trash" this must be it.<br /><br />Barely for Franco-fans.
