Blood Lake (Quick Review) This particularly awful film revolves around a group of poor-acting kids in a cabin on the lake wherein somebody starts killing them. Good. I hated them all anyway. This film's title actually appears in the extremely harmless "Garfield" font. Yeah. That fat cartoon cat. I kid you not.<br /><br />Well, geez, where to begin? The acting is repugnant and the atmosphere is weak. The story is unoriginal and the killer is really lame. How lame? Well, Jason wears a hockey mask and carries a machete, Freddy has the glove with knives for fingers, Chucky is a demented serial-killer infested doll. This guy is a fat hick with cowboy boots and one leg of his pants is tucked into a boot--and the other isn't!! F*cking scary!! Well, roughly 25 minutes of this film are spent watching the kids water skiing on the lake. I'm serious, here. They might as well have flashed the logo for the brand of skis they were using across the screen. We literally spent about 10-15 minutes watching a few of them water ski, then finally they stop, head to the dock and then.... go out water skiing again!! They didn't spend this much f*cking time on the lake in "Piranha." The kills don't even look good and there is really no gore at all. This movie is just a waste of time. And afterwards, you'll be so depressed that you may see your life as pointless if this is what you waste your time doing. Watching total sh*t like this. You just might kill yourself.<br /><br />Recommended to: Absolutely no one should ever watch this film. There is nothing good here, nothing creative, nothing interesting, nothing new--except for the pants thing, and that's just retarded. Only if you're a real hardcore horror curiosity seeker--but if you really want a depressant, just try alcohol. 1/10 (I tend not to give zeros.) By the way, it's shot on video.<br /><br />(www.ResidentHazard.com)
