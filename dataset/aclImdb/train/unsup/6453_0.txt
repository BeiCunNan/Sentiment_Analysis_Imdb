I signed up for this membership to say something after reading all the negative comments on this movie. As Japanese or other Asian mostly unpopular in this country, I guessed that this wouldn't charm almost any one people here. Seems to affect some people though... This kinna represents how unwilling and unwanting to know any other culture and other aspects of life or... how don't understanding it is... about other cultures... Took me about 10 min. to register this site and I kinna assume that people commenting here would be better than the ones who didn't. If you want to see hard boiled action movie or die hard hollywood blockbuster movies, please do not watch this movie. I also love mind numbing endless action movies like the ones played by Mel Gibson, Steven Seagal, Jean Claude Van Damme. This kinna contributes the marketer who try to suck all the money out of movie goers not telling them what this is really about. Funnily enough this is about life and everything inside it. And about how hard it is to achieve the simplest and smallest thing in the life of one person as it may seem so easy to do so. My best guess is this director doesn't tell you what to do or what to think of so don't be offended if not understood. He is also an ordinary person living and wonderding every aspects of life he is dragged. Just he is trying to be honest expressing himself and I think that's what it caught all other people who are affected in any way. OK. Just think how life could be lovable and intimidating by being itself.
