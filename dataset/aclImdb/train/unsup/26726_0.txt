I think that " Popular" is a great show and that you should bring it back!!! I have both seasons and i would buy the 3rd season if there was one. the show is great and i really enjoy watching it. It is a funny and dramatic and love watching it. You should bring it back!!!!!! My favorite characters are Mary Cherry and Sam McPherson. I think George and Sam make a great couple same with Brook and Harrison. The t.v show involves really problems that teenagers deal with every day. The t.v show is very realistic. It is my favorite t.v show and i think it is better than any other t.v show on t.v right now. I think they should continue this show because they left the 2nd season on a cliff hanger and now i am wondering what happened. I think that "popular" should start up again!!!!
