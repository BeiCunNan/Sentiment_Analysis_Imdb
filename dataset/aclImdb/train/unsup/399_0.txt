[MAY BE SPOILERS]<br /><br /> Whenever I visit Disneyland, the very first ride I go on is this one! It is the coolest! The best ride in the whole park. I must ride it about five times. I never get tired of it! I love watching C-3PO and R2-D2 always repairing the Star Speeder 3000 while the screen advertises trips to Endor to visit Ewoks or a ski vacation on Hoth, or perhaps a wild adventure on Tatooine. It's so cool to see C-3PO and R2-D2 up close! You feel like those who have been in the movies. Then you board the ship. Your captain: RX Droid named Rex. The start of the flight is bumpy because he steers the ship right into the maintenence bay, then he zooms right past the Endor moon and right into a comet field. When that has passed, we run into the Empire! Then we help the rebellion blow the Death Star into oblivion then arrive safely at our destination.<br /><br /> Again, the coolest ride at Disneyland! I hope they never touch it to fit those prequels. It's fine the way it is! So in conclusion, if you haven't ridden this ride before then my God, ride it! Immediately! You will love it! I guarantee it!! You'll wanna go get in line again when the ride's over! We all know the lines at Disneyland are murder but there are plenty of cool things to see while waiting. So please, ride this ride ASAP! You won't regret it! And may the Force be with you!<br /><br />-
