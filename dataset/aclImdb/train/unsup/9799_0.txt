...as MOST of the very very unjustified and critical reviews about Loose Change SE are from people who only wrote ONE comment on IMDb; to tell us that this movie is rubbish because it's facts are wrong.<br /><br />Yeah, right.<br /><br />I liked this movie because someone has to dare to produce such stuff. It is highly entertaining as well. And it will make us rethink about what we behold as true. Which is very important because most people are eating what the American Media is giving them to eat: Bu**Sh**<br /><br />And no matter what the truth is, it is not the official report and that is a fact for sakes. We are the people and the government needs its people like it needs the government. But it is the people to be supposed to have the power, not the government. Go to some courses of constitutional law, you might learn something about the philosophical background of a State, its territory and its population.
