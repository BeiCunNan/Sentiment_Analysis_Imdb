Metro's answer to the gangster movies made by Warner's is exciting film fare.The film marks the beginning of the Powell-Loy partnership which made legend in their next pairing.Gable's portrayal of a sympathetic gangster is just as good as any of Cagney's at Warner's.Great comic turn by Nat Pendleton as Gable's not too bright henchmen.
