This movie has everything: frocks, dancing, songs.... I love those "Russian" songs by Kern, and Irene Dunne really can sing. She can act too - see the scene where professionalism forces her to be polite to John's fianc√©. Fred and Ginger's dancing is transcendent and one of the great works of art of Western civilisation for the past 3,000 years. And Fred plays the piano too! (And is very funny.) He sweeps Ginger off her feet in the last scene, but when she proposes to him he's inarticulate - but he says yes, of course. And who wrote his amusing descriptions of the frocks? Could it have been Kern's old Broadway partner, Pelham Grenville Wodehouse? The only flaw is a running gag about a band member with a falsetto voice who tries to sound butch. How the groundlings must have laughed!
