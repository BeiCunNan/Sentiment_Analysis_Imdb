"Book of Caleb" is a refreshing film that enjoys it's own quirks and justly so; it is a film about a boy (Montag) who, with ever fiber of his being, is set on never joining the bored mediocrity of the adult population. So why should it fit neatly into a boring adult-oriented genre? Answer: it shouldn't. It won't. This film requires an open mind and the willingness to just let it exist. <br /><br />Although I can understand that this film would tend to have more of a following amongst the male population, I enjoyed it very much for the humanity of the characters and the plot which accurately exposed the unpredictable nature of a life well-lived. I enjoyed it so much, in fact, that I watched it again a few days later.<br /><br />Congratulations to the makers of this film on a job well done.
