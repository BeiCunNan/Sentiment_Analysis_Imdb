When someone mentions the word "superhero", many names will come to mind. Spiderman is one of them. What makes Spiderman stand out is how "unsuper" he really is. He's an unlucky loser in tights. While Superman and Batman were loved by one and all, and they were the All-American heroes, Spiderman was the big loser. His secret identity was a teenager who couldn't pick up girls. He was the nerd who seemed to lose everything...even his family.<br /><br />But as if by fate, one day he got bit by a radioactive spider, and while that might seem unlucky, it gave him the strength of a spider if it was his size, and the ability to climb walls, and shoot webbing.<br /><br />OK, now that you know about the web slinging wonder, Spiderman, let me describe the movie.<br /><br />It's the year 1977, supposedly. Peter Parker is trying to make some money for scientific purposes, meanwhile, a man is using the power of mind control to get money. after making unsuspecting minions do his dirty work, he plans the biggest threat of all - if he isn't paid 50 million dollars by a Friday afternoon, 10 random people will die.<br /><br />There's only one man who stands in his way...Peter Parker. Alias; Spiderman.<br /><br />I found this movie very entertaining. i still do. the special effects were pretty good for the time, the music funky, the plot original, and everything else just great. if anyone says this movie is bad, no it is not. it's Probably one of the nest TV movies i've seen.<br /><br />i suggest you see it.
