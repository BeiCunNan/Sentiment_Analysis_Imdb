Not the worst piece of crap I have ever sat through, but darn near close. A bunch of film students at a state college could have produced something of this caliber. First of all, Nazis with British accents? That was the first indication that the director would be asking the viewer to suspend one's disbelief. Then, Anthony Hopkins as Adolph Hitler? Charlie Chaplin could do a better job. Hopkins performance was a parody of Hitler. Was he serious? When the director yelled cut, did the entire cast break out in giggles? At times he portrayed Hitler as a jolly Englishman. When it began to fall apart all around him, he was a ranting lunatic, but not a very believable ranting lunatic. Der Undergang ( The Downfall ) was the most powerful movie I have ever watched. It is a German made movie with an all German cast. The language is in German with English subtitles. It makes you feel you were right there in the bunker in the final days. You felt what those who were actually a part of this history felt. This made for television movie was so inferior that it made me wince at how bad it was.
