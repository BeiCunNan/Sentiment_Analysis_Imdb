Killer Shrews is bad, the script is bad, the acting is bad and the production values are very bad. The "killer shrews" are dogs. The dogs are wearing collars with what looked liked seaweed attached. The shews alone make it worth watching. Add to that all the other "Z" movie elements, and you have a classic turkey. While is does not sink to the subterranean levels of Plan 9 or Robot Monsters, it is still a must see for all loyal turkey fans. Try to catch it at a turkey film fest near you. Those shrews really do deserve to be seen on a full sized theater screen.
