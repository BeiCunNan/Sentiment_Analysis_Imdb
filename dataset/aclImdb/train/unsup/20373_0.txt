I went into the cinema with very low expectations. Very low. I'm usually very lenient with films and am not picky, but this film, honestly, If I hadn't been there with a friend, I would have got up and left. My expectations weren't even close to being met.<br /><br />The film surrounds two best friends, who, by mistake, have their wedding booked in the same place, same day, and oh my gosh, can you believe it, the same time!!!! Shocking, isn't it? Neither of them want to move their date, so they start fighting. Then, the film takes you through a series of weak attempts to get back at one another. Totally unpredictable, I know. That's basically the entire film, aside from what is supposedly a "surprising twist" to finish of the film. <br /><br />The script was empty and there was no chemistry at all. <br /><br />I had virtually no expectations of this film, but I some how came out disappointed. <br /><br />Unless this is the ONLY film left in your video rental store, do not rent or buy it. You'll regret it.
