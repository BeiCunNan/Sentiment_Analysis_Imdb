This movie was so much better than I expected, which was a simple romantic comedy with predictable "pass each other in the street" scenarios throughout. I was pleasantly surprised to find a love story that touched my heart. Renuka me non's vulnerability and pride in her Grand father made me cry and Barath's sensitivity and devious behavior were so very sweet.I liked the cartoon character of Barath which is the masterpiece character in Indian cinema.Great and unforgettable movie. This movie was warm, funny, smart and great. Barath and Renuka light up the screen and Barath is the perfect hero! The movie was 2 hours long, felt like 10 minutes, and I didn't want it to be over!
