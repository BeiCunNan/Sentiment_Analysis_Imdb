I see by the copyright this thing is six years old but does it ever have a lot of relevance to today's scary post 9-11 world where a violent "superhero's" actions make the world safe by storying a lot of it. Ignore the people who rag on the "deliberately primitive" animation -- they clearly don't get it. Frankly the political and sociological subtext of Hoverboy is likely beyond them. Watch it with an open mind; you're bound to learn something about the human condition and may even realize that our leaders (from McCarthy to the current administration and politicians on both sides of the spectrum) have long used fear to push their own agendas.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor: watch this thing if you can find it and tell your friends to do the same. <br /><br />Long Live Hoverboy!
