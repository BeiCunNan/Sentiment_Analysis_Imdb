This was definitely not a good ending for the Ori story. It seemed like they were out of ideas and invented a Deus Ex Machina solution - the Ark of Truth. Which they manage to find because Daniel Jackson has visions about its location! Give me a break! <br /><br />Moreover, they destroyed the the female characters, both Vala and Carter. It's hard to say what was the use of the Vala character in this movie - she literally does nothing! And Carter was turned from the powerful and smart character in the TV series into nothing but a hard-working supporting character (who bakes cookies and kisses the male hero at the end - bleah).<br /><br />Finally, the most annoying part of the movie is a prolonged fist fight between Mitchell and a super-mighty replicator-powered bullet-resistant android who would have killed anyone with a single blow. The movie keeps returning to this ridiculous fight scene after scene after scene. Total non-sense.<br /><br />Definitely not worth buying nor watching, especially if you're a fan of the TV series.
