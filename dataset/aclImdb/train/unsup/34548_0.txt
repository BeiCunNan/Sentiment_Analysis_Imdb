This movie is so STUPID! I mean.. why does Liam Neeson take this woman so seriously, having only heard her say 3 WORDS! When they found her in the woods, they should immidiately have committed her to psychiatric hospital to try and make her a real human being. Just to see Jodie "hey-see how stupid I look" Foster dance around chanting is stupid....
