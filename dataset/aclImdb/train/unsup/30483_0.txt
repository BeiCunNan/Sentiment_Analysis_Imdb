Sunny Deol tries comedy for the first time ever in Jo Bole So Nihaal, and he is successful at this, as he gives witty remarks and street talks the FBI (which he calls 'Fully Bewakoof Insan')! As you watch the movie, you will come to realize that Sunny's character, Havaldar Nihaal Singh, is the only smart character in the movie, so if you ever want to watch this film, do it for Sunny. I also like the 'No If! No But! Sirf Jat!' Sunny continues to be amazing in action, and now he adds comedy to his list. Although it is understandable why the movie became controversial, there was no intention of hurting anyone. Sunny was just being funny. The film also has its thrills and fun scenes, although the climax could have been better, but the boat chase in the Everglades was brilliant. If you want laughs, then just sit back and relax and enjoy!
