This certainly had a darker ending than what I was expecting. There are some nationalistic Chinese, whom with some influence, say its not historic. Further objections are raised by this group because of occupation. There wasn't enough evil occupiers killing Chinese. Well, so what? In the film, there is a line that makes it clear. While the Japanese had no problem slaughtering those that opposed them, however they were also human and scared as hell. Just because it didn't show lots of bad things by the Japanese, doesn't mean the film is a-historical.<br /><br />The characters are well done. The sex scenes certainly weren't as graphic as I thought they might be. I have seen longer and more obscene sex in R and even PG-13 films than this. However, the sex seems to have been forced and more along the lines of rape.<br /><br />The plot was very involving. The main character was trapped in a seduction that crossed so many lines for her that she breaks down near the end and bares the emotional scares before her comrades - describing the rape-like encounters. It isn't pretty to hear, but it shows how committed she is.<br /><br />Overall, I believe this is a well done film. It is historical in many ways. Just because it doesn't show all the fighting doesn't mean its not historical. Most of the people involved in World War 2 never saw the battlefield. "A"
