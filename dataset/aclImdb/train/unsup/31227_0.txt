when the film came out on TV around 98 or so I saw it and thought it was the best sci-fi film that was ever made.....bare in mind I was 8. Now in 2007 i watched it a second time and before seeing it i saw people on the IMDb website saying words like it's superb or excellent and and thought to myself it must be as good as I remembered. <br /><br />Oh God how I was wrong. I seriously can't find one good thing about this movie. This is the perfect example of bad film making... 1) Bad Script (e.g. The Blond saying Kurt is out there more than 15 times etc) 2) Not realistic (e.g. Tommy not putting down camera....ever) 3) Terrible! acting (I seriously tried to get into the film but the bad acting from EVERYONE accept from the black guy and the one called Mel...and they were only okay) 4) Eye Sore watching all the different camera angles from the camera 5) Not Original (came out just after year after Blair witch came out)<br /><br />5 great reasons to hate this film and for the love of god read this = IT IS NOT REAL, IT IS NOT BASED ON TRUE EVENTS, IT IS A STORY Written BY DIRECTOR and just found out today the film has a fan club. this is the first film i have ever said was terrible (check my records) and i can't understand why anyone over 10 would think this was real or any good at all! COP ON!
