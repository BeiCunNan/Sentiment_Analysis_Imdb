Predictably, you will see two different types of ratings. The movie gets generally high marks from believers, despite the valid criticisms from those who are not quite as enthusiastic. Why is that? One reason is the history of Christian film making is different from that of other types of studios. We in the church are used to seeing movies with actors and extras who are (probably unpaid) church members or Bible college students. We do not expect to be knocked out of our seats by a great star or astounding special effects. Not only that, but the thrust is different. Movies are made primarily to get a message out, not to make money. Believers are more interested in the purity of the message than its package.<br /><br />The purity of the message of "China Cry" makes it a great movie and well worth the time of anyone.
