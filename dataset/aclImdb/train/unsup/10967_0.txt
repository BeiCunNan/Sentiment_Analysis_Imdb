I saw this film last night (a rainy Tuesday evening - perfect for watching a film like this!) I loved it.<br /><br />The cast is outstanding. As someone who loves visiting New York City, I enjoyed seeing Manhattan - the neighborhoods, Central Park, etc.<br /><br />If you like films that focus on the characters and not a whole lot of action, this is an excellent film to see!<br /><br />
