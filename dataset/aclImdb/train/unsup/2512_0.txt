i got this film cos I'm a fan of Billy drago, he was cool in it.<br /><br />I didn't like the montages of images as they were walking through the desert, and that horrible choice of music (ganster rap) i didn't catch anyones name, there were some plot holes in it, but that didn't really bother me all that much. i did like the actual mummies, and i liked the fight scenes with them in it, but i don't understand why is was so short, and what happened to them? they came, kicked back, and then vanished. i didn't catch what happened to, billy drago's two hench men either. i was left with lots of questions after this movie, but i still enjoyed watching it.<br /><br />but any fan of drago's should get this anyway.
