I saw this movie with my mother in 1960! I was but 10 and just happened to get drawn into this movie about a young Russian soldier trying to get home to see his mom, going through all kinds of foibles and silliness traveling and government red tape presents to him, in the meantime falling in love with a beautiful, kind fellow traveler, and then finally getting to spend a few very brief moments with his mom, with a flock of cackling neighbors standing a short distance away. If this movie doesn't wrestle a few tears from your heart no movie will. Wonderfully acted, beautifully photographed (albeit black and white), exquisite portrayal of what moves the heart. Unfortunately, this movie is seldom shown, so make sure to grab a video tape the next time it is shown.
