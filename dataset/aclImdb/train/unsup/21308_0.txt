It's not hard to see why Tom Clancy doesn't give his approval to the movie that are based on his books. There isn't a single plot line in the book that the movie doesn't butcher.<br /><br />The cast is good, and if the movie had actually followed the book, the movie could have been great. I hate to criticize Harrison Ford movies, but this one disappointed me.
