As a horror film I don't think they come any cheesier. The reason I watched the movie was for a good laugh, and it provided just that. Apparently this type of "horror" scares people. They used disgusting ideas and visions to try to get a scare out of you. For me it just made me laugh. However if you want a good laugh check it out, you wont be let down.
