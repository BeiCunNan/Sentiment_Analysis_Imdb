I thought this movie was very funny. The 2003 black/white culture conflict comedy mini-genre (BRINGIN' DOWN THE HOUSE, HEAD OF STATE, etc.) gets a big lift with MALIBU'S. Taye Diggs is hilarious as a Julliard-trained commercial actor hired to play a thuggish gangsta kidnapper. Jamie Kennedy and the rest of the cast are solid as well. I especially liked the little bald campaign advisor in Ryan O'Neal's camp. I've seen him in a bunch of stuff and he's always great.
