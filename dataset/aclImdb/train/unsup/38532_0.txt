What do we have here. A nerd who gains supernatural powers. A buncha punk wannabes that act like they're the in-crowd. A bunch of stupid bimbos. And a dumber Religious fanatic mother. This movie is not worth anyone's time. This is one of those movies about nerds get back that's been done several times. Maybe it's the better of the bunch but that doesn't say much. The acting ranges from pitiful-decent. The hero jumps in after most of the movie is over and then finally does something heroic instead of notifying the police! Otherwise throughout the whole movie we don't know who's the hero or who's the villian because everyone is so stupid that no one even cares. There is only one scene in this movie that's good, where the nerd is trying to impress a girl and gets onto his motor powered trashy bike and crashed into a wall! The nerd does try to be funny at times (in a Freddy Krueger type of way) but notice I say "try". The music is tasteless, and so is the script. I think you would be more interested if you called another 9 number ; )
