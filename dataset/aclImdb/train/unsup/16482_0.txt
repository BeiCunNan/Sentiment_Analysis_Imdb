I was 14 when I went to the theater back in '85 to see this movie. I remember also that I was going to go see it again but it was gone. Watched it again on it's first run on VHS and now I own the DVD.<br /><br />I liked what one review said about this film: "This movie is the Goonies of Sci-Fi." I agree.<br /><br />Now then, with the exception of the outer space scenes, this film easily keeps your interest. Ethan Hawke's performance makes you believe Ben and everything he feels about space and his desire to know "what's out there." <br /><br />Problems with this movie start and end with the alien-scenes. Their behavior was too corny to enjoy, and the costumes were absurd, causing a beautiful film to completely fall apart.<br /><br />The idea for the story however was solid and this would be a good film to be remade. The ending was left wide open for a sequel. I found myself wanting more story when it was over. Still do.<br /><br />River Phoenix was great as a computer-nerd. Film buffs may also remember Jason Presson (Darren) from "Stone Boy", but not much else. All in all, those three guys played well off of each other, and it would have been nice to see them get a chance to play the characters again if an Explorers 2 had ever been made.
