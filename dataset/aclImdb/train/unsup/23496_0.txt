Okay, so first of all, this movie is a MAJOR MAJOR insult to the first one AND movies everywhere. When I saw this movie I couldn't imagine what must have been going on in these peoples minds!!!! The actors and actresses must have been paid extremely high to do this because I'm sure they would have never done it on a regular budget. This is so bad of a movie, I just can't comprehend how these people could ever imagine this thing up. I would have to say that no one should watch this movie and if you have watched it, I feel your pain. The effects were horrible, dialogue was terrible, and the whole entire story, directing, etc. was terribly horrific. If you liked the first one stop right there, and do not go any further with this film, PLEASE, DON'T GO FURTHER.....
