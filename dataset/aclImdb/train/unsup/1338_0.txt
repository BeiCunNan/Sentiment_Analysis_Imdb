Alicia Silverstone is very hot, though the title of this strange looking thing really sucks.<br /><br />When rich chick Alicia fakes her own kidnapping by locking herself in the trunk of her car in order to get attention from her elusive father (Jack Thompson), a car thief (Benicio Del Toro) steals it while followed by two lowly hoodlums and Alicia's anemic uncle (Chris Walken) who wants to bring her back to Daddykins. <br /><br />Alicia is beautiful and Benicio is handsome in this light romantic-comedy, though all the car trunk scenes will make you look at your watch.
