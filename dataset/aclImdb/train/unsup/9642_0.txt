I know one of the actresses in this film but I don't think I'm biased because I've told her when she doesn't pick the greatest projects lol.I saw this at the DGA theater in NY and I'll be completely candid about what works and what doesn't work in this movie. What didn't work for me was some of the editing/pacing. There were one or two scenes that dragged bit - the first guy that was killed in the forest plus why didn't he say anything? The other scene I wasn't crazy about was the guy wandering around aimlessly with clippers - what was the point of that? Wasn't all that crazy about the performances of Peter's friends. Here is what does work and quite well. The photography in the movie is exquisite. The color red really jumps out at you. The sound track is to die for, especially since it is an original score. I've read other reviews on here where people say this is some of the best art work they've seen. They are absolutely right. There are some very powerful performances here. Three come to mind. The woman who plays the teacher, Liz Callahan is an absolute pro. The guy who plays Peter, David Morwick is also great. He's got the natural stuff. Erin Merryweather played by Vigdise Anholt is one scary villain. She nails it. Knowing that this was low budget and not done by a studio, it blew me away watching it in the theater. This belongs on the big screen. Also, I've heard the ride to finish this film was a tough one particularly for the filmmakers so they have my respect for seeing it through. The good definitely outweighs the bad and that is why I give a ten.
