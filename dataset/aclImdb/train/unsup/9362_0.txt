Not a lot of people realise that this is a remake of an old Vincent Price classic about a man who's head is transplanted onto a fly's and vice versa. Whilst that film was a ridiculous B-movie, this truly disturbing adaptation is something far different.<br /><br />An obsessive scientist decides to try out the teleportation machine he is perfecting on himself, little realising that an ordinary housefly is trapped in the transfer chamber with him. Upon reappearance, he seems to be normal. But he soon begins to slowly transform into a monstrous hybrid.<br /><br />While most horror fans may see this as a silly monster movie, little realise that at the heart of the story lies a man who is trying to fight a bizarre form of cancer that he is slowly succumbing to. The on-screen chemistry between then-husband and wife Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis brings the real sense of tragedy to this movie. This helps transcend the grotesque display of mutated flesh going on here.
