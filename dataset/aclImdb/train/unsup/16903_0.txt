A Perfect Murder is spell-binding until the horror movie cliche ending. This film is very tight and the more you pay attention you can see the characters working things out with the audience. It's a near miss for me, but the film just left me empty at the end. I will say that Michael Douglas enjoys playing a villain in this movie so much that you can see a smile in his eyes at the joy of being utterly evil. Worth a look.
