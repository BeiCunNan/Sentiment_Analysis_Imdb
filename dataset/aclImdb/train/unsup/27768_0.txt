I first saw this show when I was very young (when it first came out). In fact, I believe it was the first "horror" show I was allowed to see, I was 7. It gave me such nightmares at the time that my mother refused to let me see any of the genre films until I was in my teens.<br /><br />When I recently saw it again, it brought a smile to my face. It was one of those movies that was so bad it was good.<br /><br />The "special" effects were very Dr. Who-ish. The monster was pathetic and the acting very bad. The budget must have been smaller than mine, LOL.<br /><br />This movies rates up there with "Plan 9" and others.<br /><br />A lot of fun to watch.
