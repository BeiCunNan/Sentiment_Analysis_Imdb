I just saw this movie yesterday - running on one of the Starz channels and didn't really know it was directed by MNS until the titles scrolled by. After that, there was surely no getting up from the couch! I think it is subtle and understated and somewhat contemplative. We all have similar questions, is there a God? If so, what does he/she look like? This was done without any special effects but with some basically simple yet tight screenplay. With excellent performances by almost everyone involved, including Rosie *gulp*.<br /><br />I particularly liked the performances by the kids. Just comparing the characters here to the first two Potter films, where IMHO the kids are relatively flat, you'll see some genuine emotions ranging from sadness to satisfaction to fear to uncertainty but most of all a sense of doubt in something almost everyone else seems to take for granted. Highly recommend watching it in a silent environment at home!
