Richard Burton was always a wooden film actor and an overacting ham who just recited the lines in that horrid chain smoker's gravel voice of his. He was far too old for this film and looked like he was about to drop dead at any minute. All the other actors were too old and obviously unfit for their parts as well. This is a racist film, and it was made in South Africa in the apartheid era. This was a hugely controversial decision. Roger Moore, a Tory tax exile who should never have been cast as James Bond since he was already too old when he started, had no problems with funding apartheid throughout the 1970s. This is just a very bad, predictable and clich√©d film by that hack director Andrew V McLaglen. To be avoided.<br /><br />0/10.
