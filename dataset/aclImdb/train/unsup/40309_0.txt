This is another one of those overly contrived "Geeks overcoming odds to become hero" hollywood-ish story.<br /><br />This theme has been played to death. It is nothing more than another left wing ideology with the weak overcoming the strong. Anders (Jacob) is the typical king of dweebness. He lust after Sofia (Ulving), gets to have his way with her and then finds true love with another girl at the end. What a cool nerd?<br /><br />Unfortunately, we have been over-saturated with this kind of motion picture propaganda. Nerds and geeks no longer have to fear Darwin's rule of nature. They have these movies to promote their cause worldwide. At the end, it was just another bad attempt on filmmaking. Watch at your own peril.<br /><br />
