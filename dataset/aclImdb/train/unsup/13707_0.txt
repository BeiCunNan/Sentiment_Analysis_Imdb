There are already too many comments on this one, but ... As usual, lots of people seeing this movie were looking for characters to "relate to," and feeling jaded because not only is there a dearth of such characters, but the film also forces the viewer to re-evaluate his or her personal belief systems. If the movie was not as successful as it is (in terms of stirring up deep-seated emotions), then there wouldn't be so many poor ratings on this BBS.<br /><br />The aspect of this movie I think gets overlooked is the character of Howard. Of course he is not the manipulative misogynist that Chad is, but in this manner his character reveals a more subtler objectification of women. He goes along with the wager, and although not as active a character as Chad, is every bit the misogynist Chad is. He just doesn't have the mettle to act on it, to utilize it like Chad. The fact that he falls in love with Christine in no way makes up for his earlier actions. If anything, his character is more repellant because his personality is not the overblown, cartoonish behavior of Chad. Howard represents the average man, the type who likes to think all people are equal, but in his heart things are always stacked in his favor.
