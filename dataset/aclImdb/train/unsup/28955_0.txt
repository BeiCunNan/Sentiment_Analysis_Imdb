There couldn´t have been a better pay-per-view for the WWF to open the year 2001, because it is almost perfect. This pay-per-view contains 5 matches:<br /><br />Women´s Championship Match: Ivory vs. Chyna The least interesting match of the evening. I´m not a favorite of women´s wrestling because most women in the WWF can´t wrestle all too well. Except for Chyna of course.<br /><br />Tag-Team Championship Match: The Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian<br /><br />All I can say about this match-up is that they have had better ones in the past.<br /><br />Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit<br /><br />This was a good solid match with two of the better wrestlers within the WWF.<br /><br />WWF Championship Match: Kurt Angle vs. Triple H This match-up could have been better, but it was entertaining.<br /><br />30-man Royal Rumble Match The highlight of the evening. The best royal rumble ever, because there were so many great superstars involved in this match, such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, The Undertaker, Kane, Rikishi, etc. It also contained the surprising return of the Big Show and some guest entrances from The Honky Tonk Man and Drew Carey. This certainly was a perfect rumble.<br /><br />
