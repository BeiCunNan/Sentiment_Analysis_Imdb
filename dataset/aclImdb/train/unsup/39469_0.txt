Why should detritus like this have to have so many lines to get a review on IMDb? Other reviewers voted for the bear, I was hoping my liver would leap out of my body and thrust itself down my throat cutting off oxygen to my lungs and hence my brain. This was wrong not on "so many levels" but on all levels. This movie as far as I could bear (pun intended) to watch it stank. OK, let's start. One girl going off with three guys? not nice... Maybe if they'ld been Church-going types. Even then it's wrong. (Is this actually what the USA is like?) Moving on, they fool around in their 4wd kill a bear cub and then get hunted by the oh so predictable toxically challenged bear mom. The formulaic crash later sees them looking to repair that steamy thing at the front of the car. Not only do they bring a cooler full of empty "evian" bottles, but they don't seem to realize a 4wd means four-wheel-drive, so the "dude, our tyres spinning" line makes the idiots look like they belong in kindergarten, as they and the "people" who made this do. The bear was laughable, no, that's not true, I cried it was that bad. Did the director, producer etc put their names at the start of this? I can't remember. I'm betting they only put it at the end knowing only teenagers intent on scoring might make it to the cringing finish (sorry teenagers, but hey, if it gets you where you're going who cares! right!).<br /><br />Finally, even the scenery was lame.
