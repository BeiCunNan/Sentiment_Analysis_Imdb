Having just seen the terrific Fahrenheit 9-1-1, I was looking<br /><br />forward to this film. Alas. "The Corporation" is not really a film; it's<br /><br />a seemingly endless parade of monologue snippets with pathetic<br /><br />graphics in-between. In short, this is not a film. It reminds one of<br /><br />mid-20th Century "educational" films, but is not nearly as<br /><br />interesting. Ninety-five percent of this film is common knowledge<br /><br />(and if you don't know that corporations have taken over everything,<br /><br />then you are part of the reason why we have the evil government<br /><br />we have). Five percent contained new information. Alas, this film<br /><br />had no editor worth his or her salt. It was dreary beyond belief and<br /><br />after two hours, my friend (who reached the same conclusion as I<br /><br />did, but totally separately, since we do not talk during movies)<br /><br />looked at me, we got up and made our escape. Michael Moore<br /><br />has proved over and over that politics and information do not have<br /><br />to be dull. He knows how to use images to make his point. This<br /><br />documentary-maker doesn't.
