What can I say? Truly awful. Get has-been stars and some hip new ones to make a lesbian-themed film for HBO. The result - a dry stale muffin that's been overcooked. Everything about this film is embarrassing, from the sanctimonious and pass√© treatment of lesbians as victims to the terrifyingly awful third installment where Sharon Stone and Ellen DeGeneres offer an achingly sentimental tale of sperm banks in a style that only be described as thirtysomething on prozac or ecstasy. It feels so chaotic that you often wonder if they actually had to act. As for the rest, the first installment with Vanessa Redgrave contains more holes than a golf course; while the second with Chloe Sevingy and Michelle Williams feels too hip for its own good and sits uncomfortably with the other two parts.
