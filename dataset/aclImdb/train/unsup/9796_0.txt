This show is so great. Shows like this only come once in a blue moon, and sadly, most American viewers don't get the wacky brilliance. This was one of the last MTV shows I was happy to see. There were so many great segments, most notably precious Roy and calls from the public. I also really enjoyed the main characters' totally inane conversations. It was hilarious in such an absurd way. So many of my friends I went to high school with also loved this show. It's too damn bad a show like this didn't get picked up by Comedy Central or Adult Swim, because those channels were better at dealing with more out of the box shows. It's surprising that no other shows have tried to do something like this, considering how little money it would cost to make
