I went to the cinema last night and much to my disgust my friends wanted to watch xxx2. I had tried to talk them out of it by saying it will have no decent acting and/or a very poor storyline. THAT WAS AN UNDERSTATEMENT! This is by far the worst movie i have ever seen, It sucked and i want 2hours of my life back. The storyline (if thats what you call it) was very, very, very poor. It was a "B" no i would say "C" grade movie with an "A" grade budget. The hero was a fat African American who thought he was Lord Of The Earth and did not even fit the stereotypical action star genre that i had expected. I swear this guy has no self esteem problems, he is so much up himself i laughed my way through the entire movie. I cannot believe the extreme stupidity of this film. As i sit there in the cinema person after person was walking out, not to mention the laughing at of corny and serious lines. I would never recommend this movie and i believe that it would not even be suitable for Midday Television.
