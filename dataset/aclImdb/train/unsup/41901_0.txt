I saw this at the video store and it caught my eye. Ooooh I told myself, look at these awards, this could be a low budget B-movie worth watching. Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />This film was written bad, the actors did a bad job, the story was... well how can I put this...LAME!!<br /><br />I couldn't believe how boring and how bad the acting and story was all at the same time. Do not waste your time with this movie.<br /><br />If you are watching this for horror, don't bother. If you just want something bad to laugh at, this may be for you that is if you don't fall asleep.<br /><br />Directing - F; writing - F; Acting - F; story - D; Over all movie F-
