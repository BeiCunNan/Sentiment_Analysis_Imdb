I have read all the "Jump On The Band Wagon** It's a lousy episode reviews here and what I have read makes the posters sound like idiots. This is not the best Trek Episodes but the reviewers here are citing "Charlie X", "Wink Of An Eye", "Spectre Of The Gun" and "Spock's Brain" as bad episodes.<br /><br />I think you guys are idiots!! I will cite a few problems with this episode.<br /><br />#1: In one scene Lazarus #1 or #2 you don't know which has a goatee that goes from thick to thin #2: The dilithium crystal assemblies fit into Lazarus's ship like they were designed for it #3: He falls off cliffs even though he is disoriented and off balance.<br /><br />The episode could have used more detail and the whole universe being annihilated thing is basically "The same matter can't occupy the same space at the same time" The fact that they were in the same universe at the same time has no bearing!!
