For a while, I had (blessedly) forgotten this movie, and then for some reason, I was reminded of it. And then I remembered that I couldn't stand this movie. When I went to see this movie, it was a "nothing good is playing right now, so let's just watch this" kind of decision. Well, the point still stood at the conclusion of the film.<br /><br />I think it could have been funny in a twisted, morbid, sort of way, but a bunch of prissy, "evil", dingy Valley Girl stereotypes, plus the one girl who "is really a good girl and has a conscience" didn't add to a creative or interesting story. It was campy in a way that just made me groan over the fact that I was wasting time in seeing this, and I just kept staring at my watch, hoping to this film would mercifully end.<br /><br />Honestly, it felt like a bad "Saved By the Bell" episode, and I would have probably welcomed some commercial breaks to give me a breather from the monotony. I couldn't even enjoy the cliched silliness of this, and I love(d) Mystery Science Theater 3000.<br /><br />Here's the best way to sum this film experience up for me: Marilyn Manson with a moustache. I think that says more than enough.
