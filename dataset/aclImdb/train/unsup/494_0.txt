I don't know where to start with this complete cow-pat of a movie! The plot at the beginning is credible enough, Elwood sets about reforming the band with some new additions. When they meet Queen Muset that is when things really go wrong! I;d had an inkling when those skully horses lept out of the storm cloud! Many actors from 'The Blues Brothers' (1980) made a welcome re-appearance, but even they couldn't save this from this film being a flaw! The only redeeming feature is the music but there is not enough of it to constitute watching. If you haven't seen the first one, by all means watch this but given half a chance watch the first one first, give this film a miss. Nia Peeples was the only reason I watched this (principally) But her usual classy acting was let down by her co-stars (the noticeably and unusual wooden Dan Aykroyd) plus her great figure was mostly hidden by a police uniform! Give this film a miss if you like the first and if you haven't seen the first film...give this one a miss anyway!
