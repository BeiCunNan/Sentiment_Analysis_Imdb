Steven Seagal movies are famous for killing and kicking ass. In this film, Seagal is so fat, that they do not bother even to find a stunt-man for him. Whenever there is action in the film, he just disappears from the picture and re-appears when the shooting and fight is over. He doesn't beat up ANYBODY in the whole film, can you believe that? Well, you would, if you look at him, he looks so sadly obese, he can hardly move, let alone walk. He is wearing a terrible wig and a terrible three-piece suit during the whole film, which spans during a 5 day period, but the worst part is the script and dialogs. A pre-schooler could have done it better, honestly.<br /><br />My piece of advice: WATCH THE FILM. It is SOOOOOooo terrible that you can use it as reference point for the rest of your life when judging other films.
