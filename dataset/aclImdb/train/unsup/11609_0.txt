Charles Grodin, De Niro , and Josh Ashton make a terrific and hilarious trio. Charles Grodin's humorous skeptimism of De Niro's professionalism is hilarious. The scene while they are getting chased by the helicopter is outstanding. I love how they are all screaming, then you hear Ashton comment that maybe the helicopter is gone, and you hear Grodin reply, "Oh Im sure we're perfectly safe" in a very dry and disapointed tone is SO FUNNY. On a scale of 1 - 10, this movie breaks the meeter and goes to an 11.<br /><br />
