As i am alway interested in a sf movie, i picked this one up at the local video rental store. Never heard of slipstream but the 10 minute time travel plot seemed interesting.<br /><br />This movie however fits straight into the top 10 worst movies ever. It really got it all : Very bad acting, small budget, horrible plot and the worst directing ever.<br /><br />The director seems to be in love with guns and slow motion, in this movie you get to see more close-ups of guns than of the actors. Enormous amounts of bullets are shot at each other while standing up and with the actors looking like they are watching TV. No worries however, almost all shots miss completely.<br /><br />Then there is the bus scene where the bad guys take hostages. The bus is supposed to be on a highway. Due to budget restrictions the highway has about 5 other cars on it instead of 500. Furthermore the police action is totally unbelievable.<br /><br />The FBI agent runs around with the main character she just arrested without any regard for his safety. The rest of the police is checking out their guns while the director zooms in on the guns triggers, red dots and what not.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is equally bad and unintentionally funny. The director is only good for making gun commercials.<br /><br />Waste of 80 minutes and 1,60 euro.
