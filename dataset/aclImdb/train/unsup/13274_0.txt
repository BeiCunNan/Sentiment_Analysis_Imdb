Probably one of the finest action movies I've ever seen. Simultaneously the writing and directorial debut of the great Kevin Rapp, this is like a blockbuster action movie with a brain. Casting Micheal Baldoz as a veteran with a haunting past was a stroke of sheer genius. Perfectly offsetting Micheal Baldoz is Micheal Guerin, in what is probably the greatest role of his illustrious career. While the one brother is dark and brooding, the other is marked with a fiery temperament. However, both brothers share the same passion: Justice. Together they combine to save Alexandra, played by the beautiful and talented Monique Scott. A must-see for fans of action and drama alike!
