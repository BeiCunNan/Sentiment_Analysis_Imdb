These actors belong in a B movie.<br /><br />Not one of them rises above this dung. You almost feel bad for them-ALMOST. You almost pray one of them would have the talent or the moxie to just try to make something of their latest failure.<br /><br />It isn't like some Hollywood producer staying up late watching the SCI-FI channel suddenly said hmm, that Soliel Moon Frye really is riveting in this.<br /><br />Starts off kind of goofy and fun but once the bad special effects kick in you'll feel like YOU'RE in a bad school play about..I don't know what it is about. The actors (that is being very generous) seem to act like it all makes a lot of sense.<br /><br />All the blame shouldn't be pointed at the actors who are clearly not ready for their next pilot that doesn't get picked up on the CW. The direction is pedestrian and the editing just silly.<br /><br />Did this win any razzies? How about worst ensemble.<br /><br />Funny, none of these actors BROKE OUT since this made a splash in 1994.
