The filming of this picture was interrupted on two occasions, one from an old back injury, Karloff was rushed to the hospital for an emergency spinal operation and Actress Rose Hobart was replaced in the role of the cataleptic (Mrs. St. Aubyn) by Katherine Emery. This so called "horror" film had a great lack of action and was a drag, even its suspense only mildly was interesting. Even Boris Karloff fans will note the tired way he performs through the entire film. This picture takes place during Balkan War of 1912, General Pherides (Boris Karloff) rows to a tiny Grecian island to visit the grave of his wife. Oliver Davis (Marc Cramer), an American newspaperman, accompanies him. After finding the coffin looted by thieves, they accept lodging in the household of Albrecht (Jason Robards Sr.,) father of Jason Robards Jr. an antique collector. But they soon discover plague has infested the island. Kyra (Helene Thimig), superstitious old crone, believes Thea (Ellen Drew), an attractive Greek girl, is a vampire and responsible for the deaths. This film is not one of Karloff's best performances. However, it is a Classic and a must see film for all Karloff fans !
