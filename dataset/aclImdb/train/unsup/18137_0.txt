I watched this movie at the 2006 Toronto Film Festival, and enjoyed it.<br /><br />However, I've been trying to work something out. <br /><br />What did the people who were trying to bribe Muharrem want from him? <br /><br />Did they want the Order to give them construction contracts?<br /><br />Did they just want to get in his good books because he was a influential man in the community?<br /><br />If anyone who has watched this has any idea, please post.<br /><br />The director was present at the screening, and he was asked this question in the Q&A after the movie. He didn't really understand the question, I think it was lost in translation, as he only spoke Turkish. <br /><br />Thanks.
