... That is, after all, what the subject in question was all about; candidly highlighting the REAL 'evils' of the world and arguing very convincingly that there wasn't much wrong with discussing common truths, even if they DID happen to be 'unpleasant'. If 'words' are indeed 'power', then here in this film for all to see was a MAGNET of a man, a beacon. Sure, it's 'dark', but then, so too is life, so honesty comes forth once again. Hoffman brilliantly shows us a guy unafraid to bare his soul on stage night after night, and when the authorities took that away from him, there was basically nothing worthwhile left. We must remember though, that he was a pioneer, so his 'trailblazing' gave a path for others to follow. Who knows how many lives were saved by people finally being permitted to say what was on their mind?<br /><br />It's an altogether different proposition than Fosse's other 'lighthearted' fare, and it suits me as a viewer a whole lot better. Who goes through life singing? Well, 'Lenny' certainly didn't, but this great piece of cinema shows that he WAS a totally committed 'humanist', of a sort.<br /><br />Life may not always be 'tra-la-la', but even the darkest passages can provide plenty of 'ha-ha'... ! 9/10.
