I have seen this movie twice, and it took me the two viewings to really appreciate it. It is a typical gangster flick - heavy on the gun-toting action and lighter on plot - but this is what I have come to expect from an action movie.<br /><br />The film's biggest flaw comes from the confusing mix of languages, particularly the use of English. I felt that the actors were so hard pressed to make their English accents understandable that their lines often came across as clipped and emotionless. The police in particular really annoyed me, but you have to give them credit for trying.<br /><br />I was, however, highly impressed with Kelly Lin's language skills. She seemed to make the transitions between English, Japanese and Mandarin very easily. She is just so watchable! Takashi Sorimachi had it easy, being required to speak only Japanese. Andy Lau's English got better as the film went on, or maybe it just grew on me. I can't really comment on anyone's Cantonese because I don't speak it.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the plot, whether it is cliched or not. Basically, Sorimachi and Lau play two assassins who vie for the title of Number 1 and also the attentions of a girl (Lin). The police are hot on their trail as well.<br /><br />Not having seen many other movies of this style, I cannot compare Full Time Killer to other films which may be regarded as better or more original. All I know is I enjoyed it for what it was, having gone in expecting a little less than perfection, and I was not disappointed.
