A film about a local brewery director, his wife and their life in the brewery. I didn't really like anything about this film, except for the fact that it has to do with beer (that was the reason I watched it after all) and that you see a lot of home-made sausages in several scenes (accompanying the beer). It is branded as a comedy but I didn't find more than 2-3 scenes mildly amusing.<br /><br />Maybe it could only get as far as that in 1980 communist Czechoslovakia...
