blah....sorry but I can't jump on the Billy Crystal Bandwagon and tell<br /><br />everyone how great this movie was, because it wasn't really that<br /><br />good.<br /><br />Please someone find actors who can throw baseballs...I am sick<br /><br />and tired of watching these types of baseball movies. At least<br /><br />when Kevin Costner throws a baseball he looks like a ball player.<br /><br />But oh well maybe my expectations were too high from seeing all<br /><br />these great reviews.<br /><br />City Slickers 3* anyone...anyone...anyone?
