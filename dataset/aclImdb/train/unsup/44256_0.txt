I am a huge fan of the first and second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, they were both fun films that even the oldest adult could still have fun too, I grew up with the cartoon and movies, so I just loved them from minute one. I never had an interest to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, because it looked so horrible, but my friend said it was pretty cute and to give it a shot, so I did since it was a free rental and at least I finished the sequels. But it did waste my time because it was so sad hearing really lame voices and the costumes seemed to be different.<br /><br />Basically, this is going to be such a short paragraph since the plot is really very simple, but here it goes, the turtles now have a time stick thing-a-ma-jig, so when April accidentally steps into it, she goes back to the 17th century in China switching places with the king's son, the turtles must go back and help April. But they find out that they need to help the army against and evil British soldier, or at least from what I've gathered.<br /><br />Please, stick to the first and the second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, those are really the worthy and fun movies for the classic cartoon and story. This was such a bad change, to be honest, if the directors couldn't get the original cast, not including Casey Jones, he shouldn't have bothered, because it was so disturbing hearing Splinter in a scary high pitched evil Japanese voice, you have to admit, it was scary.<br /><br />3/10
