These 3 stories are each so brilliant and wonderful... each in its own way. They describe what it was like to be gay in a small town in Connecticut in the 1950's, the 1970's, and in the year 2000. We see the hopelessness of the lesbian of the 50's - forced to move to Greenwich Village, and the torment of the perfect student/athlete of the 70's, who is nearly killed by his classmates for being gay. The stories ring true, and I can attest to the validity of them, because many of the same things happened to me.<br /><br />The film includes many grand performances by a large number of our best actors and actresses, just as some of our best writers put the stories together. And it ends on a somewhat upbeat note. This film is a treat which should be required viewing in all schools and churches.<br /><br />Don't listen to the negative reviewers of this great film. They seem to be shocked by how DECENT the gay characters in this film are. Well, guess what? Most of us ARE exactly like that. Yes, there is a need for films showing the full spectrum of gay people, and there ARE. Look for them. But the Brittany Murphy character in this film's 50's segment lived a story almost identical to that of my aunt. I myself had an experience VERY similar to that of Jonathan Taylor-Thomas in the 70's story. And I KNOW people living the 3rd segment today. So don't tell me these stories are "unreal." They are DEAD ON real. And my thanks to all three playrights for giving them to us.
