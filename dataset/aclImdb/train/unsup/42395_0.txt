Even if "Faith Ford" is beautiful this TV/Movie is very boring.<br /><br />How it's possible to spend one cent for this kind of "thing". I think Hollywood producer think everybody are idiot.<br /><br />The "story" of this film have no sense. And like 99% of time, director don't know what is winter and what is cold.<br /><br />When human talk at -30C they are steam outside of mouth. And in this movie it's suppose to be -70C but we know we are in Hollywood studio at 24C.<br /><br />Music is like this TV/movie. Boring. Actor/Actress are middle but it's not possible to be good when the story is so idiot.<br /><br />I don't know for what Hollywood think they are just Stephen King who write book. It's a shame cause they are so good writer who are never "show".<br /><br />If you want lose your time watch this "movie". Else do any other thing.
