This production is outstanding. The cgi is feature-film quality and totally imaginative.<br /><br />The off-hand humor mixed with profound myth and storytelling is an astounding narrative device -- totally compelling!<br /><br />Excellent acting by the cast to boot.<br /><br />An overall Emmy-deserving piece of art.<br /><br />Must see -- WOW !!!
