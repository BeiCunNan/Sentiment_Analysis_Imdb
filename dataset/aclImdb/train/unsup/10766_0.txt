It is a mystery to why I bothered even watching this film because I knew perfectly well that any film shown at 3 o'clock is not going to be remotely entertaining. For a lack of anything better to do (this has to be the only reason for anyone watching it), I sat down and tried to take in this tripe.<br /><br />First of all, it is obvious that it is trying too hard to be funny and is blatantly copying features of respectable films e.g. SHREK and THE EXORCIST. Punchlines are too obvious, these half-baked jokes are unbearable and you wonder if the producers even bothered thinking about how the plot works. Also, someone in the production is totally obsessed with slapping people.<br /><br />I feel pity on the main character for being so embarrassing. He deserves better! Even though I have been only exposed to mostly decent films, this has to be one of the worst movies of all time.
