"For the Boys" is a fantastic film. This is for sure one of my favorite all time movies. Bette Midler gives a great performance. The film makes you laugh and cry. It should of been nominated for best picture. Although Midler did win Best Actress at the Golden Globe Awards for her performance in this movie. A MUST SEE!
