Irene Dunne sings two Jerome Kern numbers, "Smoke gets in your eyes" and "Lovely to Look at" and is just that lovely. Fred dances up a storm and so does Ginger, but the latter is cast as an ordinary Indiana singer who masquerades as a Polish Countess. Irene Dunne is a fashion designer for the house of Roberta. She is much classier as a Russian émigré Princess who downplays her aristocratic origins. Fred is a band leader and hoofer for the Wabash Indianans and arrives in France to play at a Russian émigré club owner's café who is disappointed that they are not Indians. Fred grew up with Ginger in Indiana, but puts own foreign airs to land a job at the same café. His best friend and football coach played by Randolph Scott goes along for the ride and ends up as Irene Dunne's business partner. Plenty of room for entanglements follow.
