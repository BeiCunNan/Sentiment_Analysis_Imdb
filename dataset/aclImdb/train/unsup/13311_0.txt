I will be starting this review by saying that this is an EXCELLENT movie.<br /><br />Miike, THE Auteur of the 21st century, is producing films at such an alarming rate that its almost impossible to keep up with the man. Yet he manages to keep producing films of an extremely high standard AND creating different and interesting techniques. Izo is another fine example of this.<br /><br />The broken structure is far more complex than Nolan's 'Memento' and far more effective as it allows you to experience the agony that Izo is constantly feeling.<br /><br />The constant metaphors that keep popping up throughout the non-stop carnage bring more layers to the film than any 'shock' movie yet Miike still manages to throw in a few gallons of blood and a very interesting place to hide a sword (ladies) for good measure.<br /><br />So in summary a very poignant anti-war piece with some fine visual styles and some very brutal action. And a great guitarist.<br /><br />Go see. And take the whole family. <br /><br />Cinema at its best.
