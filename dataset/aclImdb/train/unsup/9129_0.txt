This is one of my all time favorite movies. The story is heartwarming, and beautiful. Kids will like it for it's comedy and memorable characters. Adults will like it for it's message that beauty is more than skin deep, and love can do miracles. Beauty and The Beast has some of the best music and scoring. Great voice performances, and beautiful animation makes this a really, really, really, really, really good movie. It is just really, really, really really, really, really good <br /><br />In Conclusion: <br /><br />The Second Movie of the Disney Golden Age, and One of the Best Films Ever Made.
