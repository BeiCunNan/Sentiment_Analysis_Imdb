Right up front I should say I've never seen the first three Scary Movies, I probably should. I just went out to see this with a friend cause it's Friday night.<br /><br />With that out of the way, I can say this movie was definitely enjoyable. It's not a down right riot, it's not totally pathetic, it's right in between. It was better than Date Movie by a long shot, that's for sure.<br /><br />I would tell you what I thought of the story but I honestly wasn't paying attention. Something about a Japanese kid's dad's heart stopping aliens. I don't remember, I was to busy watching and waiting for the next joke. The jokes indeed come fast and frequent, some better than others obviously. My favorite scene of the whole thing was easily the final one with Oprah...that was just crazy. The Saw scenes were also quite enjoyable. Some of the jokes do fall flat on their face, for instance the constant usage of a butt with all the aliens (butt spouting lightning in the sky, a butt sucking people into the tripod). Others, however, we're bust your gut funny. Jigsaw was probably the funniest character in the whole damn thing. I've never seen the Village so that part confused the hell out of me but I think I got the jist of it.<br /><br />Most of the jokes, however, were pretty unoriginal and predictable. You could easily tell when a joke was coming seconds before it happened and most of the time you could probably predict exactly what it was going to be. For example, when the grudge kid begins crawling down those stairs in his creepy way, you know he's going to fall down it. Low and behold, he does. When Leslie Nielsen started talking to the UN about reversing the polarity of a laser that takes people out of their clothes, you know he's going to take the clothes off the whole place. Bingo. It should be noted that before seeing the movie, I hadn't seen the trailer or any of the TV spots, my friend informed me afterword that both these scenes were shown in them.<br /><br />Leslie Nielsen, by the way, was hilarious in this. Sure, his character has been done a thousand times but it worked fine for me. I too wanted to know what happened to the duck. However, just about every single girl (and a few guys) screamed....when he lost his clothes...I almost did as well....that's....just.....*shudder*.<br /><br />All in all, the movie is enjoyable. I recommend folks see it, but it probably is one you can wait for on DVD. I only urge folks to not over analyse it, it was a simple parody movie and nothing more.
