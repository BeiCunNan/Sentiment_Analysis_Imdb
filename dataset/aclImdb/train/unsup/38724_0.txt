I read the positive review(s) above and am absolutely astounded that a theater full of people could watch this and think it was funny. Or clever. Mass hysteria? Stoned out of their gourds? Straight?<br /><br />On a message board, a poster notes that on the DVD extras the Queer Duck creator says that all the participants except one were straight. I don't know if that's true, but it might explain the quality of this film. It feels like some doofus-hipster straight guy's idea of what he thinks is funny about gay life. <br /><br />Very young children might find this film funny, but it would be inappropriate and they wouldn't understand that it's supposed to be satirical. It would only reinforce whatever stereotypes they've already picked up from the media. Anyone above age 12 or with an IQ over 70--gay or straight--should avoid Queer Duck like the plague. <br /><br />If the man who made this is gay, I'd say it's an exercise in self-loathing. If he's straight, he's got a bad-, bad-, bad-sitcom sense of humor and a very superficial idea of what it means to be gay.<br /><br />Gay life can be wickedly, screamingly funny, and it's ripe for laugh-exploitation. How a satire on gay life could be this lame--that's the only word for it--is utterly baffling. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen and undoubtedly the worst animated feature I've ever seen.
