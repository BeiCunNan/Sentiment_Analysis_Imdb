Evocative, funny look at four women stuck in temporary employment, and not all that thrilled at being there. Solid ensemble work from the four leads, with Posey (as usual) stealing scenes from her costars. The only flaw is that the film verges on becoming boring sometimes itself, which is really just a tribute to how well it is presenting its subject, and possibly the point.
