I stumbled across this film at a friend's house one night, and wasn't that eager to watch it since it's not usually my type of film, but I am very pleased I did. Kisses and Caroms is a hilarious indie film which packs the jokes in thick and fast, but also has rounded, believable characters and a truly enjoyable plot. As something of an indie film-maker myself, it's exciting to see a film like Kisses and Caroms, because it manages to use it's indie status to it's advantage - free of studio interference, Vince Rocca has crafted an outrageously funny film which could never have come out of Hollywood, whilst still not falling into the traditional pitfalls and clich√©s of independent film. The characters DON'T endlessly monologue in a desperate "trying to be Linklater" way, there's no "trying to be Tarantino, Rodriguez or Smith". Instead Kisses and Caroms is a sex comedy which doesn't try to be anything more, but although it doesn't aim to be any kind of higher-art, the film leaves you happy and inspired, and to me, that's more important than anything.<br /><br />If you get a chance to see this film, take it - you won't regret it.
