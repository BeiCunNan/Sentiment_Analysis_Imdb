I happened upon this movie on television. I think it was on A&E, it intrigued me because the story line was so unusual. It captured my attention in a sea of films that are all too much a like to be watchable. This movie riveted me to my seat, I did not want to miss any of the it. I watched it, and knew I had to rent it, because when the commercials came on I just wanted to be able to see it in its entirety without the ads. Barbara Hersey is very good in it as a Professor, and Tom Berenger as a sort of black sheep, a rebel of sorts, with a dog that he loves more then anything. He has lived his life out in the wilds and knows how to track, but he does not want to. All he wants is to be left alone. Barabara Hersey is a knowledgeable History Teacher that knows a lot about Indians, and is interested in artifacts unearthed. What could be two more unlikely pairs to find themselves interested in the same thing. His father-in-law hates his guts. A dark secret keeps them at odds. Tom Berengers life is a mess, and he has a loner reputation with the town that he inhabits. Mostly he keeps to himself till one day when he is pressured into tracking some convicts down. I do not want to tell more, go rent it, you will not be disappointed. There is just such a great story of mystery, and lost cultures, and hard feelings dispelled. Something to open up the wonder again for a far off time that most cannot hope to reach or see but get just a glimpse of it in this very fine film. I bought this film at Christmas time, I wanted it for my collection of great movies.
