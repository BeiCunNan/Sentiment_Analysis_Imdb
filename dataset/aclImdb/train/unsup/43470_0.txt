In spite of the tremendous tunes "It Might as Well be Spring" and "It's a Grand Night for Singing," the movie's music is the weakest of any of the Rodgers and Hammerstein movies. Add to this that the movie is introduced by non-singers singing a non-song (OUR STATE FAIR IS A GREAT STATE FAIR....ad nauseum) and the movie lacks the punch and drive of the holy 5--Carousel, Oklahoma, Sound of Music, South Pacific, and King and I. Interesting that this is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein show to get TWO filmed versions (and the less said about the 1960's version the better).<br /><br />The other BIG shows deal in BIG issues--Nazism, Race, Freedom, etc. "State Fair," however, presents simply a small love story.<br /><br />The movie is well cast, well filmed (aside from some unfortunate matte work), and pretty; it is NOT up to the standards we expect from its originators.
