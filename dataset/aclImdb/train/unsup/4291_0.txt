CAN THINGS BE EVERLASTINGLY BEAUTIFUL WITHOUT BEING GREAT! That is the answer which I am searching here through a movie, "DIL CHAHATA HAI". I have heard people saying the movie, "DIL CHAHATA HAI" is just another teen summer movie which just comes & goes by without leaving any substantial impact. I would say that is a disgrace. It certainly did on me; it left on me an ever-lasting impact that I can reminiscence forever. <br /><br />I still remember that evening when I first borrowed "DIL CHAHATA HAI" CD secretly on the way back from mathematics coaching & very excited to watch it because my sister watched it two days ago & highly praised. Though she did not reveal that until that day's morning or it accidentally slipped through her lips. Actually I was going through a very critical stage of my academic career. My exams were literally knocking at the door, only 10-12 days left. So my folks made me a promise to abandon watching it till the exams got over. But I can not hold that long if there is anything related with movies. If I could, I would not be writing about it now, would I?! Somehow I managed the whole thing out {don't ask me how} & I did watch it.<br /><br />So, without diverting any further with my past numerous hidden movie experiences, when I first watched it, I was simply dazzled by the beauty of the movie. It took me in such a state of ecstasy where I felt like I was doped. I was terribly sad when the movie actually ended. I was really hoping that it would go on forever, I really did. The movie had me in such an engrossing manner that after completing, I dreamed all the night about it, about the characters. On the next morning, I plugged "DIL CHAHATA HAI" again & then again. It seemed like going on forever. But after a while, I desperately felt an urge to get out from it & eventually it took quite a few days to get back to my normal system.<br /><br />By telling you all this nonsense childish stories, I'm trying convey here if one movie can create such a profound impact on a kid like me back then {I wasn't even the only one, after doing some personal survey back class, my friend-circle & the courtesy of some movie magazines}, It can not be just a movie; it has to be more than that.<br /><br />As time has passed, I have seen many more good movies. I have learned the true meaning of movie, enriching with such great films from where I have found the purpose of my life. I'm really grateful to those movies. If I had to say anything which changed my way of looking at life forever, I would definitely name those movies. No, I would not name "DIL CHAHATA HAI" but I just can't seem to forget those joyful moments it gave me. Yeah, it was my "SUMMER OF '69" & always will be.<br /><br />Cheerio.
