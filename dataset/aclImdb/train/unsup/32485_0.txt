To kako is an independent zombie movie from Europe. It was done with very much of a low budget and less special effects like they used to have in Hollywood.<br /><br />The plot is very common. A zombie disease with it's point of breakout in Athen. A couple of miners finding a secret cave within a highly toxicating gas. Soon the outrage begins and a couple of survivors find themselves right into the heat of the zombie chaos.<br /><br />I really can't say, that i liked this movie it's not even an average zombie movie it is just bad. I don't think, this movie is supposed to be a trash production but with the filmmakers opportunities they would have been able to produce such as a decent movie. First of all the actors. They are gross. There is no acting skill, no realistic characters or even sense. A preteen is played by a women that looks like a 21 years old.<br /><br />The effects are very cheap and absolutely inappropriate. The effects in Georg Romero's Dawn of the dead were much better and this was a movie made in the 70's. Sure it's not fair to compare it with Dawn of the dead, but still they don't even try.<br /><br />Don't watch this movie.
