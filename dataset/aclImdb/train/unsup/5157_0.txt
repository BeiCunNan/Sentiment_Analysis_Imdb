Good....but not great. The main problem with this film is that although all the cast try very hard, its just not *that* funny. A major flaw with a comedy. And there isnt really enough drama to support it either. the basic idea seems to have come from that bit at the end of The Producers where they are running a musical in prison. This film features a group of convicts all planning to escape during the Governors new musical "Nelson - The Musical". It all meanders along very nicely, quite funny in places. Bill Nighy is a plus point to this film, but still doesnt get enough funny bits to do. And although the musical is meant to be laughably bad, it mostly just seems fairly dull.<br /><br />The one truly brilliant performance here comes from Timothy Spall. His character gets very little time on screen, and yet, due to his acting, you find out more about him than any of the leads. Unfortunatly, his subplot is rapidly glossed over, hiding a lot of the serious point the film tries to make.<br /><br />So, see this if you have nothing better to do, it won't waste your time. But, if you really want to see an edgy British prison comedy, watch an episode of Porridge. If you want to see a comedy featuring an appalingly bad musical, see The Producers. If you want to see an amazing acting performance, see, oh, anything else with Timothy Spall in. Perfect Strangers is a good place to start, although he doesnt actually feature that strongly in that either. Still, look him up, you wont regret it.
