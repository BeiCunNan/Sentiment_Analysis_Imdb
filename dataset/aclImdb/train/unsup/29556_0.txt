A group of college kids who took the acid "blue sunshine" in 1966 are now getting headaches, losing hair and killing people in the most violent ways. Jerry Zipkin, ineptly played by Zalman King spends most of the film delivering his lines like he has to go to the bathroom. <br /><br />King gets the blame for several of the murders because he is trying to find out who has taken the blue sunshine, arriving just before the homicidal effects kick in. Of course simply telling the people about it could save them but this little fact eludes him. Instead of feeling sorry for King we wind up wishing he took the acid and would off himself saving us from his bad acting. <br /><br />A few people in this film went on to other acting gigs.....it is very easy to see why King did not. This film is an opportunity missed. It has a great premise and tons of potential but it is pretty much ruined in from the start by very bad acting...mostly by King. I wonder if Zalman King took some acid in 1966 and made this film in 1976 when the effects kicked in and removed his talent. If the knob of the TV is broken and you are pinned under the sofa and are waiting for someone to show up to save you....then you might want to catch this film, otherwise use the remote and do the right thing.
