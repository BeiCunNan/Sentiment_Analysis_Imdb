In 2005 we had White Noise where someone looked through the static on a TV-screen in a paranormal way and saw the dead and the way they tried to get out of there. In 2007 this sequel is released and it is one of these sequels that should have been released straight to DVD. It's almost a crime that films like this are being released to cinema, wasting valuable screen time.<br /><br />White Noise 2 starts when a guy has a near death experience and learns that he can see which people are to die soon by simply looking at them and checking them out. As he learns of this gift he starts to save them and as expected that is where everything goes wrong.<br /><br />This film fails on every single aspect: badly acted, badly predictable story, mismatched shock effects, no tension what so ever, and worst of all, a plot that blandly contradicts itself at various stages.<br /><br />3 out of 10 bored dead.
