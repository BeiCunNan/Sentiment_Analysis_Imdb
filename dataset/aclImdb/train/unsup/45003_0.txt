A movie can get no more boring than this. It's a movie about a little, annoying twit with a stutter who gets to help a girl out on the debate team. The boy is Hal (Reece Thompson, just annoying as hell in this.) The girl is Ginny (Anna Kendrick, also pretty bad in this.) Together they form an annoying, stupid predictable relationship. The only mild laugh was from Jonah Hill as a student who sits next to Ben at the library. The movie is a mess from start to finish. It's another annoying, extremely predictable teen comedy in which a no one gets to be a someone. There is no real plot, the characters feel too forced, and scripted, and the jokes are just depressing. I can't really say I was disappointed by this film- I knew nothing of it, although I regularly do like D'Agosto. I feel like I should have never seen it. It's 98 minutes of my life I'll never get back. It's such an annoying film. The main problem with the film is that the film presents itself with a main character I just wanted to shut up. It's a movie of such tedium and annoyance that I have to say it's one of the worst film I've seen in a long, long time.
