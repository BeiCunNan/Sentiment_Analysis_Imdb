i just finished watching ED2 and i can say it's the best gore-black-comedy that has ever crossed my gore-terror thirsty mind... i'll check army of darkness tomorrow, but i can say undoubtedly that if you loved ED1, then this one will make you cry for more!!! but you'll cry with blood tears and zombie laughs!!! this film is so over the top!!! PLENTY of GORE, BLOOD, ZOMBIES, AWESOME SPECIAL EFFECTS, PAIN and PURE BLACK HUMOUR -> that's right, capital letters!!! it is impossible to stay away from such a master piece!!! there's not one single boring moment in the movie, it's pure terror from the first minute to the most unexpected and unpredictable end!!! the movie hero makes leatherface (the Texas chainsaw massacre) look like a church chorus boy and "swallow this" is just the most wicked line ever in the gore/terror movie history!!! this movie is a pure "show no mercy" to people wishing to see cubic litres (not litres) of blood spilling all the time and creative scenes as the dance of the dead bride or the inphamous zombie hand... pure magic and entertainment!!! too bad the scale only goes till 10, the movie makers and the characters should get a 20, and i'm being modest... just run as fast as you can and rent it, and trust me, i'd change a date with a nice girl to stay home watching this masterpiece, it's PRICELESS!!!
