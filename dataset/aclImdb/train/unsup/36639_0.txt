The pink panther jewel again has been robbed and as suspect is also the famous thief named the Phantom(David Niven),botcher,bungling Inspector French Surete Jacques Clouseau is assigned to investigate it .But his plane is disappeared.His nemesis Chief Inspector Dreifus(Herbert Lom) jumps with joy.A journalist(Joanna Lumley) wants to look for him, she interviews various personages series (Burt Kwouk,Andre Maranne,Niven and Richard Mulligan as Clouseau's father)to make a television programme .<br /><br />This is the last film with Peter Sellers who died during the filming and is constituted by a compilation of stock shots and outtakes from previous films added original reel.The combining old and new material is a little embarrassing and absurd.Thus appear images film as ¨Pink panther strikes again¨(again with Colin Blakely and Leonard Rossiter),¨revenge of the Pink panther¨,and struggles with Cato Fong(Burt Kwouk) what we have seen in previous films.The new filming realized evolves a costars cameo(Capucine,Niven,Graham Stark) of early Pink movies.Both shooting are linked with some hilarious and diverting moments but another ridiculous and disappointed. Opening and ending titles by Depatie and Friz Freling,they'll make the successful TV cartoon episodes.A always lively and catching music by the great Henry Mancini.This time writer,producer director Blake Edwards is limited the editing the former and some new footage and making a mediocre film. Rating : Below average.
