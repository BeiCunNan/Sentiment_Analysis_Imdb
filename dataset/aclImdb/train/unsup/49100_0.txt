Like most viewers who saw the English theatrical trailer of Night Watch, they too may have been enthralled by the horror and action. Possibly one of the better story lines of the genre; I loved the idea of the balance between light and dark/good and evil, the special effects at times where pretty cool, the twist was unexpected (to me at least) and the way it sets up the sequels is also commendable. But, whether or not the filming company neglected to give the required amount of money to make this movie a blockbuster annoys me. The cinematography was a huge let down; no special angels or dark contrast, although the startwas OK, but a bit too nice for me. A horror needs to be scary at all times. Also, guns would have been good.<br /><br />Overall, the storyline would have truly transformed this trilogy into an epic, but whether it was lack of funds or lack of cameras, this was the biggest let down I can remember. Until there is a remake by someone like Peter Jackson or Ridley Scott with $100m in funding, the potential brilliance of this film will remain hidden.
