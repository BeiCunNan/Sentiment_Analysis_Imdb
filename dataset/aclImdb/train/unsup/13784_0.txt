I't's unfortunate that the destruction of earth is the only thing that can get rid of Casey Kasem. Aside from that, why did all the actors in the first few minutes of the film look like low budget 70's porn stars? If only they had killed off the two garbage characters early in the story, or just not had them in the first place, I can see a potentially good movie there. Instead they spent most of the movie on emotional dross, produced largely by the whiny nut case and her would- be rapist. The instant those two died the movie improved immensely; the characters started acting normal, an engrossing plot began to form, and just as it was about to get really interesting one of the ships disappeared and the movie ended!! What kind of filmmaker would do such a thing? It's so cruel; to torture the audience so long, give them the hope of being entertained, and then snatch it viciously from them! How depraved.
