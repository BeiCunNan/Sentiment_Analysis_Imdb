Harrison Ford is the president of the United States, and mighty bad ass one man army he is. I wonder if Petersen ment this film to be a parody? the evil Soviet Union threatens to come back! the president of USA is kidnapped by a bunch communist terrorists! but be afraid no more! Harrison Ford steps up and teaches the bad ivans a lesson.<br /><br />This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen. Full of cliches, laughably typical red neck patriotism and equally laughable plot!<br /><br />I was rooting for the "terrorists" for the whole film.
