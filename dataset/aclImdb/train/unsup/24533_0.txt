It's not very often you get an action movie that has exciting action scenes, a strong story, and explanations of stuff without bogging down the entire movie. X-Men is one of those movies. This movie had me engaged from the beginning of a young Magneto going to a concentration camp and discovering his powers of bending metal and Rogue discovering the hard way of her ability to take another mutant's powers(or the life from a non-mutant). The action scenes were extremely exciting and engaging. From the small skirmish Wolverine and Magneto had on board a train to Cyclops and Storm's fight with Sabretooth and Toad inside the train station to the huge climatic duke-out inside the Statue of Liberty, the battle scenes kept me on the edge of my seat, wanting more. Even when Professor X was explaining to Wolverine about his school and mutantism, it didn't bog down the story at all, but kept it going as we got a better understanding of what was to happen. The end was great and left it open for more as Magneto sat in his plastic prison cell, telling Professor X on his way out that the cell can't hold him forever, leaving it open for the sequel.<br /><br />If you enjoy action movies, Marvel comics, or superheroes in general, this is a must-see movie and an x-cellent kick-off to one of my favorite movie trilogies.
