Man, I'll tell ya, how did they get the money to make this film? What a complete waste of a great original storyline. All the "god' talk ruined this film. That and the b-rated TV series format filming. The 1st Starship Troopers was great! Unique, artful, and energetic. It kept a great pace and moved from one interesting action point to another. It was really cool to see Rico and the gang go from a high school punks to gung-ho soldiers. It had big-name actors and big-screen cinematics...<br /><br />And ST3? jeeez...nothing but a bible-thumping rant. It's a shame, cause the Maruader suits are pretty darn cool and are in line with the original book.
