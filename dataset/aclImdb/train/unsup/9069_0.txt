IÂ´ve seen "The Unsaid" recently on the Fantasyfilmfest in Stuttgart. This film leaves me breathless. The actors were magnificant, Andy Garcia in his best role yet and Vincent Kartheisser, oh my God, he gave me the creeps, I think it was his first major role. The story is good, but not excellent, what makes this film so wonderful is the directing and the performances.<br /><br />Watch out for the guy who plays Andy Garcias son. Cute and talented.
