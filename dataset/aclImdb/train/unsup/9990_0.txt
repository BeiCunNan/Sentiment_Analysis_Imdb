****SPOILERS****SPOILERS****SPOILERS****SPOILERS****<br /><br />You've been warned. Okay, I can't stress this enough but the 'hero's' chin really does focus your attention on him rather than what masquerades as a plot. The hero, Nick Miller, a college physics professor, invents a time machine on his Cessna using a Commodore 64 (yeah, you had one too right?). He, stupidly, sells his invention to the local evil corporation headed by the initialed JK Robertson (NOT to be confused with JK Rowling of Harry Potter fame, of course). Said evil corp duplicates the technology and proceeds to usher in Apocalypse in the year 2041. Big-chinned hero and reporter girlfriend try to change the future and in a series of events too painful (and not horribly important, though including one version of girlfriend Lisa getting killed and a duplicate Nick coming into the picture) to recount, they along with JK, flunky Pink Boy and garage mechanic end up in 1777 Vermont. Blah, blah, blah...<br /><br />One of the blaring flaws is them messing with history. JK kills his Michael Medved looking flunky in 1777 with an Uzi and the body is left there. The group freely mixes with the Red Coats and the Revolutionaries at that time without either side making notable comments about these strange looking people. And somehow, after all this interaction, the future from that point wasn't affected by the fact that these differently dressed people with strange accents that came down from the sky in a flying bird. Riiiight. You could see where, with talented writers and editors WITH eyes in sockets, this could've been a decent film. Big budgets aren't always needed. Thank the heavens for MST3K! I miss you!
