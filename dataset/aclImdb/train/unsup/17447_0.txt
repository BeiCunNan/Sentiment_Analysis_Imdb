I love this one. Sam has a vision and learns about his future. Sam for sees his own death. Gordon tries to kill Sam for he knows the secret of Sam. Sam has the help of a fellow person with the same skills. A turn about where, Dean gets captured by Gordon, and Sam come to the rescues. Sam shows, a good plot twist, that he is the smarter brother by getting Gordon arrested by the cops, and Gordon will probably do 100 years. The humor is added when Dean is impressed and says don't drop the soap. What a great story, which keeps the viewer wanting more. What does all the plot development have to do with Sams future. Sam develops in this story form the younger brother to a much stronger character. I believe this episode will lead the way for what season 3 will be about. 8 out of 10
