Corner Gas is one of the worst sitcoms I've ever seen. It's simply not funny. All of the characters wait for their turns to speak only to make some lame pun or unfunny, witty remark. The actors have very bad comic timing, mostly due to the poor writing.<br /><br />To make a show about nothing funny, you really need a strong cast, individualized characters, and good writing. Corner Gas has none of these.<br /><br />And what's with the yellow-red camera lens? The show looks like it's been heavily filtered, which makes light play weirdly and things look unreal. This effect is distracting and unnecessary.<br /><br />Corner Gas would be much better if the actors would improvise more often a la The Office. Forget about plot lines and trying to get a complete story across. Just be funny from the beginning of the show until the end. That's all people want from sitcoms.
