First, I have to say that I am a big fan of Jean-Paul Belmondo, ever since I saw him in the french original "A Bout De Suffle" of the later remake "Breathless" (with Richard Gere). But this film is a total mistake. He might have regretted it a few times to have appeared in it, but I guess the salary wasn't too bad. And well, there's Sophie Marceau, a very nice-looking woman and talented actress, who might just as well have been lured into this movie by plain money. I cannot say that I've seen a lot of movies in my life that are really worse than this but it doesn't do the great BÃ©bel justice. In my opinion it makes no sense to waste one's time watching this picture, since it is completely idiotic with a lot of bad dialogs and other mistakes. I first saw this movie when I was about eleven years old. I remember it was a hot summer and I went to the cinema for no specific reason other than to kill some time. I didn't know what I was in for but the movie was so bad I can still remember how bad it was. Yesterday I had the opportunity to watch it again, this time on TV. I must say, now at an age well thrice as old as the first time, I could take a second look and found it was really as bad as I remembered it. Belmondo is a great actor but he made some really silly movies, maybe just for the money. Who knows. At least, I know this is one of the silly ones he made, definitely.
