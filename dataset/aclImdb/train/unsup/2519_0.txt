Acting - Diabolical Plot, _ Diabolical Dialogue, - Diabolical Lighting - Diabolical, Continuity - you guessed it Diabolical.<br /><br />Need I go on?? How this ever made it straight to DVD is beyond me. It is jaw droppingly awful. <br /><br />I had to watch it all the way through just to see what new depths would be plummeted.<br /><br />The plot jumps around all over the place, for some reason all the "undead" just disappear out of the film at some point for reasons unknown. The lighting looks like its been done by some bloke with a torch (flashlight). I just haven't enough space to express how awful this was. I recommend that EVERYONE watches this film so that they can say they have watched the worst film of all time. And i thought one I saw in Singapore about a skateboarding monkey was the worst ever....how wrong i was.
