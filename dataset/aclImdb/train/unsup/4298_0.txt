"Dil Chahta Hai" is definitely up there as one of my all-time favorite movies, and is arguably one of the best movies of the year. As usual, Aamir Khan and Saif Ali Khan act amazingly well. Akshay Khanna does an amazing job as well. Preity Zinta looked amazing and acted well too... all in all with the amazing cast and the great plot - its a movie i highly recommend. The soundtrack to the movie is pretty impressive as well, and fit in with the plot of the movie at appropriate times - not like a lot of the movies i see nowadays where some songs are put in the movie simply either for the sake of having a song, or to take up time. the songs were good, relevant, suited the mood, and contributed to the modern style of the movie. Comedy, Drama, Great Songs, love stories that work - and everything is very realistic, so hopefully this film is a wake up call to the rest of Bollywood, who seem to be obsessed with unoriginality. - If you haven't seen this movie, you are seriously missing out!
