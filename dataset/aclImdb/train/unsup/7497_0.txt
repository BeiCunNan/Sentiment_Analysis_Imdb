I adore this film. It is a wonderful drama and one of the most erotic films I have seen. The sexual tension through this movie, including the highly erotic love scenes adds to the beauty and charm of that era and Paris. It's the 'other side' of Paris. The 'creative side'. It is the tale of Henry Miller and his meeting with Anais - both wonderful authors. The main tale follows Anais as she discovers her lust for Henry and his seductive wife June.<br /><br />Using ANAIS*NIN as his muse and inspiration, Henry is torn between his lust and his passion. His faithfulness is tested as E caves to the desire of two women as they BAY to his every whim.<br /><br />He seeks the truth, as does Anais, through the *detail of the book provided* in their writings. I advise reading the works of Anais Nin and seeing the truth she provided through her prose.<br /><br />An excellent film and one of my favorite.
