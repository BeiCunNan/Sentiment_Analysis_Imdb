OK, let me get my criticisms out of the way first:<br /><br />Bad acting. No, not bad. Horrendous acting. The main character (Rick Ganz) wasn't unwatchable, but he is a few drama classes away from being called a good actor. The rest of the cast on the other hand, showed all the talent of a kindergarten ballet recital, with the charm and charisma of that kid sitting behind you in a movie theater that keep kicking the back of your chair.<br /><br />Bad camera work. Flat out just bad. The camera shakes like it's being handled by an elderly man who hasn't eaten or slept in a week. I understand that low budget movies can't always afford a steadi-cam, but for crying out loud, invest $5 in a tripod willya?<br /><br />Bad writing. The dialogue is stilted and pretentious. You can really tell that the writer is trying a little too hard to come up with classic lines and witty repartee. And for the record, he fails miserably at this task.<br /><br />Bad editing. The worst. I've seen smoother transitions and jumps on "Jackass". Oh, and Mr. Editor, it might interest you to know that a four minute long series of cross-dissolves and fades is neither an artistic vision, nor is it pleasant to watch.<br /><br />Now for the good:<br /><br />Great premise. It really is. Granted it wasn't pulled off quite as well as it could have been, but it is a great idea. Kudos Mr. Writer, it seems you can do something right.<br /><br />Good suspense. As hard as I found it to like this movie, I found it equally as hard to tear my eyes away from the screen. They do a pretty good job of keeping you guessing and building suspense.<br /><br />Overall it wasn't a bad movie. If you can get past the poor audio quality, and stomach the acting you'll have a pretty good time. I'd recommend this as a late night guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Oh, and if anyone can figure out why the hell the voice-over narration (from the main character) didn't sound a damn thing like the main character's voice let me know.
