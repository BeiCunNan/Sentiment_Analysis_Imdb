i was excited for flash Gordon to becoming to the small screen so i tivoed it, well it was half and half, half good half bad the good being the actors are good the bad is that they made the story too modern so it not as believable as the cartoon series and the cheesy1980 film. (Spoiler Ahead) good special effects and MIG was not ugly and scary enough he's quite laughable to tell you the truth he looks GQ model in spandex and not as cool as the actor that played MIG in 1980 film in truth it looked like a carbon copy of battle star the 2005 version i could'nt stand watching that version either. i guess i'm an old schooler if it's not broken why i fix it? Hollywood loves to wreck old shows by turning them into something worse ugh. i think i'll stick with the old cartoon series and 1980 film.
