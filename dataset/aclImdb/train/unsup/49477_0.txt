All throughout high school Mr Woodcock gave kids a really hard time in gym class. So hard that one student wrote a book on how to live your life and overcome such obstacles. This young man is all grown up and returns home to hear that his mother is engaged to...Mr. Woodcock. Thus providing more hard times for our lead character and apparently some unfunny situations that we are suppose to laugh at.<br /><br />Ever since the very funny Bad Santa, there have been a slew of Billy Bob Thorton plays an asshole type comedy. The one prior to this entry was School For Scoundrels. Now, if you play this two movies one after another I guarantee you that you would not be able to tell which character was from which movie, since they are almost the exact same. This film and Scoundrels, both feature Thorton an autopilot. While he still gets the laughs, it's the rest of the film that fails horribly around him, It makes me wonder how many more of these films we are going to get.<br /><br />Sean William Scott gets no laughs here. He is not playing the perverted jerk (Road Trip, American Pie) nor is this an action comedy (The Rundown, Bullet Proof Monk). So we are treated to a boring character, played by a wooden Scott. I can't help but say that the lead role was horrible miscast here.<br /><br />The script is nothing new, nor funny. Mr. Woodcock unfortunately falls into the category that hurt so many comedies. The old, "If You've Seen The Trailer, You've Seen All The Funny Parts". It is completely true in this case. I did chuckle here and there, but that's only because Thorton is abusive to little kids.
