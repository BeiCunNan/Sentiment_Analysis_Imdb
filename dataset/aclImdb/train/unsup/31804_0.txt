I'm not a huge fan of musicals, but this afternoon Grease was on TBS, so I watched it. This is such a great movie. I love the songs especially "Summer Nights," "We Go Together," "Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee," and "Grease Lightning." This movie is so great and John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John are so great in it. To that guy who said that this movie may have a little appeal to teenagers if their IQ is low enough: Excuse me! I'm am 15, and I took an IQ test and my IQ was above the national average. So this movie may have some appeal to us teenagers with higher IQ's. You probably don't understand Grease because you thought about it too much. So if you don't like it so much why don't you leave your comments to yourself and not make fun of people who may enjoy this movie.
