Someone who reviewed this on IMDb said that most people hate Spike Lee. He is highly respected in the film world however. Critics love him and I think he is one of the best filmmakers. Do the Right thing and 25th Hour are flawless and amazing. Now my little tag-line says same thing as Cop Rock. For those who don't know what Cop Rock is it was a show that the creator of NYPD Blue created because i believe NBC or ABC i forget gave him a show for whatever he wanted because he took care of that station with NYPD Blue. Well Cop Rock was about cops who go around solving crimes but all of a sudden start breaking out in rock and singing. Needless to say the station said it was god awful and asked him what the hell he was doing and took out the show. Now in relation to that, She Hate Me is just a bad film. I think the parts of the film concerning his job and his family are excellent but the rest of the film (about 80 percent) dealing with the impregnating of lesbians is awful. Spike Lee might have had this shelved for a day when he was known as one of the best and would have all the say in his picture. The film is sort of ridiculous and is very odd to be coming from Spike Lee.
