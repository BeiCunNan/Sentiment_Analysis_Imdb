Feroz Khan made several great entertainers like QURBANI, JAANBAAZ but this is his poorest work and his last try too at direction<br /><br />He seems to want to glorify himself and his son and hence made this excuse of a film<br /><br />The film goes around with sub plots, sudden songs, long bike chases and then a melodrama about Feroz-Fardeen<br /><br />The film has a weak screenplay and seems all choppy<br /><br />THe romance angle is puerile<br /><br />The film actually is laughable The film shifts from 1 plot to another suddenly All doesn't make sense and plus the scenes are so badly handled The last scene is a perfect e.g. of a bad scene plus Fardeen's bad act<br /><br />Feroz Khan makes an embarrassment of a film Music is okay<br /><br />Feroz Khan is repetitive, Fardeen Khan is bad Celina is awful
