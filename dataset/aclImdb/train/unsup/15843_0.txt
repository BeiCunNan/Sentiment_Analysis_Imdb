Horror Business Review by George A. Romero (director of Night Of The Living Dead, Dawn Of The Dead, Creepshow, and Day Of The Dead) <br /><br />" Horror Business is a terrific flick. Christopher Garetano has completely succeeded in describing the passions, the adventures- and the misadventures- of crazy people like me who, somewhere along the way, decided they... needed to make movies. Anyone who wants to write or direct should see this film. Those who have never dreamed of being filmmakers should see it for its humor and its pure entertainment value. Two thumbs up- both of them mine because, like the others Garetano has portraited, I basically work alone." -George A. Romero
