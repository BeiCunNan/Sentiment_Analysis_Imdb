If ever there was a visual account of Jesus that should be used as an evangelical teaching tool, (second to the Bible) by any Christian believer - THIS IS IT! I would recommend and use it quite easily over Mel Gibson's The Passion. Thankfully, not too much time is given to Him suffering before and at Calvary. The Passion, I think, overdoes it and tells the viewing public that a good man died a too harsh a death.<br /><br />This DVD/Video uses the N.I.V. Bible line for line, and is enacted out as though you were there in the presence of the Saviour Himself. It also shows Him to have emotion. Suddenly, the Gospels come alive! This visual account easily over-rides any account of Jesus Hollywood has ever tried to create.
