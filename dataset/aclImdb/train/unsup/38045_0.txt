Hey - it's "The Bad News Bears" again, but this time it's an older guy's softball team. How many times is this storyline going to be thrown back at us (as long as we keep paying to watch?).<br /><br />Hey - there's also the loose woman with a heart of gold and the villainous villain who struts and grabs his crotch a lot.<br /><br />There were some good scenes and there may have been something worthwhile in the screenplay and some of the characters but ultimately the thing was edited to fit the formula so that that which may have been worthwhile was lost or left to sit shining alone with no beginning or resolution. A long disjointed sentence with no commas.<br /><br />Advice -- Do not pay money for this. Download it for free, burn it to a CD -- then burn the CD.
