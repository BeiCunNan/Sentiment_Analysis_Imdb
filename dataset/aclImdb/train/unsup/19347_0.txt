Pretty much run of the mill western displaying many of the same plot lines that have been rather beaten to death in the Western genre. Star William Holden gives a fairly mediocre performance for him in this one. Eleanor Parker, his female foil and romantic interest is very blase and dutifully unthespian like as the temptress who ultimately falls for the hero. The civil war theme is an important cinematic experience, but the film lacks a lot from a creative standpoint. The portrayal of the Indians as flat characters worthy of slaughter is never more obviously shown than here. The best part about the movie was probably the performance of old civil war veteran William Demarest who is very convincing in his crusty old sidekick backup role. The Cinematography was good, except for the fact that they chose for a location a real flat desert terrain with no vegetation whatsoever, so the good camera work is somewhat spoiled therein. I would give this picture about 4 stars (out of 10).
