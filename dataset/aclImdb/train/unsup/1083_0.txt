Great stunts, decent story, good fight scenes, but some of the action was just plain silly. Most Jackie Chan movies try WAY too hard to be funny, and this one is no exception. It just isn't funny and the attempts are silly and unintelligent. They should just stick to fighting and stunts and they'll be fine. Jackie Chan is terrible at comedy.
