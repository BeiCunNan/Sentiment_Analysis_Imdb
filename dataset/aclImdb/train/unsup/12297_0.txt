When they rereleased all the Nightmare on Elm Street movies again, I was glad to get my hands on number's two, three, and four in the series. No sooner did I watch them, did I wonder what the heck I was thinking when I was a kid? Number two is the worst.<br /><br />I think I used to like the idea of Freddy possessing some weirdo kid. But geez, that might've been a fine tale to tell if the actors weren't such giant nerds, especially the lead, Jesse Walsh, played by Mark Patton in what has to be the most forced bit of acting I'd ever seen. And that really spoiled everything from the start, especially as he takes loud gasps between dramatic dialogue. Save maybe Robert Russler who plays Ron Grady, this movie just isn't worth the time. It is indeed the worst of the series (and there were quite a few bad ones). <br /><br />The story is that Mark Patton and his family move into the house where a girl was murdered. Mark, and his annoying girlfriend Lisa Webber (Kim Meyers), know this because they find her diary hidden somewhere in his room. But what's this? Living in the house and reading the diary unlocks the story of Freddy "Mr. Invincibility" Krueger. And soon, Mark starts to become Freddy as the guy has possessed his body, and forces Mark to carry out his dirty deeds. Like Freddy used to say, "You are all my children now." Too bad Mark is such a little girl when it comes to misbehaving. There's no point in going on, the movie is just stupid. <br /><br />Actually, if you're looking to watch the series, I'd recommend Nightmare on Elm Street 3: probably the best in the series, and the one with arguably the best special effects.
