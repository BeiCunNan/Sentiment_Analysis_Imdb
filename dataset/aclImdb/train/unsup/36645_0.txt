As an avid Pink Panther freak, I have nothing but contempt for the Panthers made after the death of the 'master'.<br /><br />This abomination not only uses outtakes but also used takes from Strikes Again and Return. Scenes we've seen before are thrust at us to pad out the running time.<br /><br />There are reasons that scenes end up on the cutting room floor: They are crap or do not flow properly.<br /><br />This is a disaster from start to finish. Herbert Lom is a good as ever but he really should have known better than to bother.<br /><br />The fact that they tried again the following year with Curse Of The Pink Panther is beyond belief...The power of the dollar! Shocking.
