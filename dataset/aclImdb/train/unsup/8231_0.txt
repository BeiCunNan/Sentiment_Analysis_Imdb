I think (I may be wrong here) that this was a selection for the After Dark Horror Fest. I'm a fan of what the Fest manages to achieve in terms of shining the spotlight on low to medium budget "indie" horror, but I'm sure that other fans who have seen a lot of these films will agree that your mileage may vary in terms of quality. Lake Mungo is by far the best I've seen from this franchise yet...<br /><br />Mungo is filmed as a mocumentary, but somehow this terms just does not do justice to the movie. It's the closest thing I've seen to simulating a real documentary feel; better than "Paranormal Activity", "The Last Broadcast", "Blair Witch" and the like. The actors do an excellent job in creating believable characters. The film makers shot and edited so skillfully that I think there will be a lot of folks out there who will see this movie and actually come away confused as to its veracity. It's THAT well done.<br /><br />No mater how good a film may look, however, its ultimate worth is based on whether or not it delivers to goods in terms of creativity and its ability to hold your attention (and suspend your disbelief...). Mungo manages both and delivered honest to goodness chills throughout. I haven't seen a movie this scary in years. There are plot twists galore and an ending that left me scrambling for the light switch.<br /><br />There will undoubtedly be comparisons made with "Paranormal Activity". I feel that there's a lot more bang for your buck with this film. The whole "found footage of paranormal phenomena" is becoming well traveled road these days. It's use in Lake Mungo has more impact as it is used as supporting material to support a larger story, rather than being the entire story in and of itself.<br /><br />This film is scheduled for a re-make with a release date of 2011. I have a feeling that it will do so well in the interim that a re-make will be unnecessary as everyone will have seen it already. See it!
