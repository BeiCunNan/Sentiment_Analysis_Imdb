I had to see this film twice because the audience was so disruptive the first time. Now that I have been able to enjoy the film better, I finally feel that I can write a comment. I agree with everyone else that the story is little more than "The Land Before Time" revisited, but I still think it works (for the most part). But the score by James Newton Howard is just magnificent. Kudos to the sound effects wizards for concocting the sounds of the raptors. I also like the fact that there is no sound when the meteor hits, but you hear the surge afterwards. And Samuel E. Wright is absolutely perfect as Kron, the stern herd leader. As for the film's visuals, I will say nothing about them because they speak for themselves when you see them. I will say, however, that I wish they had shot the film in the 2.35:1 widescreen format, but I am sure they had their hands full with the 1.85:1 format. But I enjoyed "Dinosaur" the second time around.
