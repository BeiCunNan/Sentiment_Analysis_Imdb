Having seen this movie more often than all others, and one of those you will never forget the theater in which you saw it the first time, it undoubtedly is Doris Day's best. I am one of many who also feel she deserved an academy award for her portrayal of Ruth Etting. With her tremendous voice, and the acting skills she demonstrated in this role, one can only imagine what she would have done had she been one of the MGM stars, when their musicals were known as the best. I understand she came within a hair of being cast in South Pacific, but as has been rumored, it was either Marty Melcher's insistence on a much higher salary, or a clash between Doris or Marty with the director. From reading her biography, it is very apparent that she wasn't one of your typical Hollywood stars. With these typical stars and directors, as well as most everyone else associated with the AMPAS being those who decide who be will be nominated, as well as ultimately winning, Ms. Day's choice of living a less typical Hollywood life style may have had some bearing on her not being nominated for Love Me or Leave Me. I definitely believe this is the reason she has never been given a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Let us hope this award will be made before this gracious and lovely lady is unable to make an appearance there.
