I'll give them point for good special effects and nice production values. I'll even spot them a point because someone who had never seen Jumanji would find much of Zathura new and exciting.<br /><br />OK, those are my 3 points in my rating.<br /><br />The bickering interaction between the siblings was realistic enough I got to use it as an example to my kids, afterward. I'm not giving it a point because it was irritating enough to get really old.<br /><br />How in the ***** *********!!! can the makers have varied SO incomprehensibly little from Jumanji? Even a sequel needs SOME variety! The Robot (which, by the way, looked pretty cool - I want one) was a dead rip off of Van Pelt. The meteor shower was a dead ripoff of the monsoon. Etc.<br /><br />I'm glad I found it on TV instead of renting it... I certainly would have been finding a way to drop another point off my rating.<br /><br />Never seen Jumanji? Sure... watch this. Have? I'm amazed anyone could have put this out on the market.
