I've seen a lot of rubbish being shown on TV in the past, but this show has to be in my Top 5 All Time Rubbish TV Shows (X-Factor is also featured on this list). A new series has just started in the UK and I'd rather chew off my own testicles than sit and watch these vacuous people hamming it up for an audience of equal worth. The thing is, I don't know anyone who actually admits to watching it - maybe I'm lucky and have friends that actually have taste (or maybe they're lying to me). Like golf, it's duller than a bucket, but TV channels insist on showing it just because it's cheap and fills slots that could be used to play decent, but expensive, shows. And please, can't we somehow put a stop to these people, after they leave the "Big Brother House", relentlessly inundating every other aspect of the media with their talent-free offerings and advice on how to achieve world peace by sticking pencils in our ears (and yes, for those who actually watch this, I know no one who has featured in Big Brother has said this  well, that I know of -- this is called exaggeration but considering all the other rubbish they spout, they may as well have)? Only in a country that loves the underdog can a fat, unremarkable, and remarkably stupid person from Essex become a star  does anyone have a shotgun? Only for the alcopop guzzling crowd that listens to the "Best of Ibiza '03" and enjoy the sound of nails scratching a chalkboard - you know who you are.
