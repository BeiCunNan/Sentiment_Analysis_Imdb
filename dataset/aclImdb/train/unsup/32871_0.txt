This was unbelievably bad - the trailer leads you to think "Hey it's another great horror flick" - WRONG!! It was so horrible I couldnt stand it another minute and we left early. Dont waste your time on this one - save yourself and go see something else, anything else!! Watching cars drive by would surely be more entertaining....
