One of two parts of, quite frankly, the worst movie I think I've seen. Certainly it is the only one which sticks in my mind with such a particular distaste.<br /><br />Tarantino takes unique aspects of some great cult movies, cuts them up, and mashes them blindly and carelessly together into a pathetic ill-fitting jigsaw. All attempts at making these into amusing parodies of originals fail, and in my case, left me writhing in my seat fighting the urge not to run out of the cinema pulling out my hair, screaming. The movie takes itself far too seriously to achieve being a good satire.<br /><br />Possibly the most annoying element of the movie, and the subsequent one, is Tarantino's onanistic worshiping of Uma. It sickens me to the gut the lengths he goes to in brainwashing the audience with his fetish. Keep it to yourself, Quentin.<br /><br />Finally, I add, would people stop praising the man for being a genius. He is far from it. I enjoyed Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, but these are not enough to make a man a genius. Hundreds of directors have made a 'couple' of good movies. I feel the afformentioned two are the only ones worth any time from this evidently obtuse director.
