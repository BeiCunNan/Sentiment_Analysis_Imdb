Persuaded by the positive comments here, I watched this one, thinking that it would be pleasantly escapist. Wrong! Does the film attempt to alert us to the plight of abandoned animals? If so, why does it select a radically unbalanced spokesperson to represent this view? She undercuts her message. Or, is the story the unbalanced woman herself? It can't be both. Anyone who has had dogs knows that you don't disturb them when they are eating dinner. Yet the dog-experienced character does precisely that and gets the expected result. So, even on smaller points, the movie undermines itself. Furthermore, is it only California that permits toxic materials to be used for rodent control? We can't do that where I live precisely because that stuff kills other animals too. So the film seemed ignorant on that point too, though I would accept correction on that point. An incoherent waste of time.
