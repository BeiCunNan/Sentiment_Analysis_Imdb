Why do people laugh in this show when someone walks in the door? or just sit and do nothing? Im serious no jokes or set up or calls back, someone enters a room and the laughter is there, why?<br /><br />Is this for real or canned laughter? I find this a broad and manipulative typical boring show in which people cant decide whether they want to laugh at something or not, 'Im a man and the wife does what I say I hate talking to her and doing things blah blah blah'.<br /><br />The use of satire in this is well off the mark, there are too many shows that play out like this are have nothing going for them. <br /><br />Don't get me wrong I love my wife, BUT - kinda jokes, lets make jokes behind the wife then act like a child when shes around.<br /><br />This is on a par with UK show My Family, complete rubbish.
