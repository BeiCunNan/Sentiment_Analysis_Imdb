I saw Ralphie May at a show in Houston and he said the same thing. I didn't believe him and forked out the $120 bux for 2 tix and went to see him. I took my wife. I have always lived and breathed Carlin and have been known to spit out a Carlin line or 2 from years past, often...I was soooo incredibly disappointed. Last night I watched this HBO special since his road material is usually different when he does the big show. It was a carbon copy of the horrible act I saw here. I hope he can make a turnaround, but sadly, I do not think its going to happen. I guess he's going to just talk about the all suicide channel for another 5 years. What ever happened to the first stage (hippy) and second (sports and disasters) phases of his career? We'll miss ya George...
