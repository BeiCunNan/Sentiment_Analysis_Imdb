The black and white cinematography is clear and crisp and architecturally sensual. Alfred Hitchcock makes his cameo appearances, and as usual it is interesting to anticipate where he will show up. This is a classic mystery thriller, but it has comedy and romance as well. The story is well-played out and fascinating to watch to the very end.
