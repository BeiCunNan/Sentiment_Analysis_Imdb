The plot of the film has been used in others in different ways, however one must acknowledge that acting of Orson Welles and Claudette Colbert added another quality to this drama. At present Black and white films are not much wanted, particularly by new generations, but the present can be well accepted by them. It goes step by step with an acting of Welles simply extraordinary, the way he moves the way he talks and argues in the film is nearly normal. The end was logic and obviously tragic. We would need more materials like these, i.e. with less violence and good humanistic messages.
