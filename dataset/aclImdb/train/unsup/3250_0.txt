This is a must-see. Technically impressing in the 1970's, but still a charming and excellent movie now in 2002. The charachters are especially funny and charming, and gives entertainment both for the parent and the kid... Fl√•klypa has given me many happy hours, if you have a chance checking it out, do it!
