This really is an excellent film, one of my favourites, up there with Godfather II and Once Upon A Time In America. Sean Penn's acting has never been better, and Gary Oldman is a revelation. Ed Harris is intense and does a great job, as always. It's unusual to have a gangster film with such fine across-the-board acting.<br /><br />I think this film "bombed" (i.e. didn't have queues around the line - but then who cares about that?) back in 1990 because it had to contend with Goodfellas, Godfather III and Miller's Crossing.<br /><br />All in all, an accurate portrayal of Irish life in America from that time, and an acting tour de force. Also, the dialogue and action are pure Tarantino, before Tarantino was there. *****
