Another late 80's routine teen-slasher picture like there were at least fifteen per dozen around that time. "Blood Lake" distinguishes itself from the rest in absolutely Â… nothing! Prepare yourself to endure insufferable jock characters, overlong padding footage of teens water-surfing to the tunes of horrible pop music, bloodless massacres, copious WTF dialogs, lousy and shaky video-shot photography and sheer annoyance. Six incredibly irritating teenagers, two of them who have barely hit puberty, set out for a holiday resort near a lake. Before the opening credits, there was a brief sequence indicating the presence of a knife-wielding killer in the region, but he doesn't make a move until late in the film. "Blood Lake" is boring beyond words without any noteworthy highlight. Not even a boob-shot or an imaginative murder. These most be the most boring circle of friends ever, since all they do in the evening is sit around a table and murmur the entire time! There a sequence like this that goes on for nearly 9 whole minutes, I kid you not! I have nothing else to share on "Blood Lake" except the message: do not watch it. This dud found a spot in my list of absolute worst 80's slashers alongside: "Don't Go in the Woods", "Deadly Games", "Appointment with Fear", "Berserker", "Cardiac Arrest", "Hollow Gate", "The Stay Awake", "Blood Tracks" and "Hide and Go Shriek".
