I'm not going to pretend that "Bitch" doesn't have its faults... it has quite a few (one of them being -- strangely, for an independent film -- the fact that it's *too* well shot for a "documentary"), but damn if it wasn't enjoyable.<br /><br />I get sent a LOT of low budget and indie movies, and most of them I can barely struggle through. I've actually held onto my copy of this one, as it's genuinely funny, isn't trying to copy Kevin Smith or Tarantino, and has some thought put into the script.<br /><br />Like I say, it's not a perfect film, but I'm keeping my eye on JP Nickel. He's going to do some great stuff in the future.
