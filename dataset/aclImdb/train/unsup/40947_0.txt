Not only is the film itself of poor quality, but its based around uncertainties, and in some cases downright lies. The truth is we don't know what the hell happened to flight 93. Do the research yourself and you will immediately notice a few things. Number one, the crash site is extremely peculiar. Its a 15 deep hole. No and I mean NO major sections of the plane were found other then one of the engines( 100 yards away from the hole) and later a few larger scraps ( 5 feet to 10 feet, no larger) . Oh and somehow a bandanna and a magazine page also survived intact( WTF? ) and were later used in the Moussaoui trial. Larger sections are almost always found at a crash sites, even in the case where an airliner slammed into a mountain, at the same angle flgit 93 supposedly hit. Look it up yourself, large tail sections etc found. Number 2, eye witness testimonies suggest multiple aircraft in the area which is not what the government claims at all. Eye witness testimonies also suggest many other things including there was no plane at the crash site and some claiming to have seen it smash into the ground. Number 3. The only known photographic evidence to exist at the time of impact only shows a large mushroom cloud halfway hidden by some forest. Not only do plane crashes not leave mushroom clouds, but when the image is compared to those of military grade bombs, a striking resemblance can be seen. After impact no fires rage as normally seen with airline crash sites. DO YOU OWN RESEARCH and do not watch this film until you at least have heard the whole story. The back of this movies box doesn't even depict the crash site accurately. Is that OK for a documentary like this one?
