I'm the kind of person who quite often rents movies i know i won't like, just because laughing at bad movies can be almost as much fun as seeing something i really appreciate. Sometimes this tactic goes terribly wrong however and the rented film proves to be too bad even for laughs...<br /><br />Camp slaughter is a story about a few kids who go out to a cabin in the woods to party (although mostly it just seems they want to whine and complain at each other). Of course since this is a murder story bad things happen. Soon enough the kids are being murdered one after one by the ruthless monster "The Bunny Man".<br /><br />This sucks. It stinks. It's terrible in every imaginable way. It's bad, and not bad in a good way. Basically what we seem to have here is a couple of friends taking their DV-camera out into the woods filming a murder story. That is fine by me, what i wonder is why they released it to the public! And why on earth it appeared on the big screen (because it did in Sweden a short couple of weeks). The problem here is that everything is too lousy, to the point where it's not even fun anymore. The ambition the filmmakers had seemed to be somewhere along the lines of "Friday the 13th". To say they fall short is the understatement of the century. <br /><br />What disturbs me even more is how easy it would have been to make this a lot less horrible. First of all they could have used Swedish instead of English. It's not a good idea to use a language none of the cast is fluent (or even acceptable) in. Their English is terrible and make many scenes laughable although they try to be serious. Also, a serious re-write of the script was needed. A little much-needed comic relief and more of a "tongue-in-cheek" approach could really have helped raise this a bit above the 1/10-mark.<br /><br />As it is, this film is unbearable. It is poorly made, horribly acted, terribly scripted. Stay away from this. If you want b-movie fun and something to laugh at there are films more worthy than this terrible outing. I rate it 1/10, simply because there is no lower rating to give.
