Tom and Jerry are in Texas as cowboys. When a beautiful female cat arrives Tom falls instantly in love and tries to be really cool. Of course Jerry makes sure he has not got a single chance.<br /><br />This is one of the funniest cartoons from Tom and Jerry. Every joke is a good one and the songs used are quite good as well and perfect for the story. Simply great.
