From its opening moments, this entry in the Star Trek universe was compelling. The characters are terrific and the setting is filled with possibilities. There's a sort of "Old West" feel to Deep Space Nine. Sure, the Law (StarFleet) reigns supreme, but when you're on the frontier, things aren't always black and white.<br /><br />Over the length of the series, the characters realized such distinct personalities, preferences, hobbies and motivations. Even meeting them for the first time in "The Emissary", it was obvious that these were people with unique pasts limitless futures. The 3D characters in Deep Space Nine are far more interesting than their hollow counterparts in The Next Generation.<br /><br />If you like the original Star Trek, skip TNG and cozy on up to Deep Space Nine. The spirit of Captain Kirk is alive and well in DS9 and "The Emissary" is a great way to meet the crew.<br /><br />Personal note: I just love Marc Alaimo as Gul Dukat. I've never seen him in anything else, but the episodes with Dukat are wonderful.
