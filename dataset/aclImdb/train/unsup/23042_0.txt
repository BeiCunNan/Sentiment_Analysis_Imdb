I like Gary Daniels....I think he's a good martial artist with potential to do some really good things, and his acting is waaaaay better than a lot of direct-to-vid action stars. This movie had some "style" in the direction I thought, but all the slo-mo just got boring after a while, and the action sequences were the flattest in the movie. The plot was OK, the acting for the most part was pretty bad with lots of ridiculous dialogue. The big villain, who resembles a giant Rick Rubin was just funny, and the movie's moralizing toward the end was just plain sad. Not to mention the terrible explosion effect. The soundtrack was actually decent and I've seen a lot worse, but I really can't recommend it, except for Gary's two fight scenes. Don't bother....
