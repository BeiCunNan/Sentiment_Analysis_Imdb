Not a great film, but worth seeing for the budding romance between Penn and McGovern. They make a very credible couple. I expected more chemistry between Penn and Cage, they are both, after all, Fast Times alums! But the script doesn't give them a lot together. Mainly watchable for a pleasant afternoon watching Penn do a nice guy role for one of the few times in his career.
