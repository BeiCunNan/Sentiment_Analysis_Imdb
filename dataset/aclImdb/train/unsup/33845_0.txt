I think this is the most boring, worst film I've ever seen. Absolutely PAINFUL to watch... can see the ratings weighted by journalistic types who simply LOVE to watch themselves portrayed as hardworking, conscientious types---instead of the jack-of-all trades, master of none dabblers who seldom penetrate down to the truth, but rely upon and create imagery having little to do with the reality they report. This movie drags on and on... on a par with "The Frisco Kid" for the perfect drive-in movie where absolutely nothing happens to detract from the "action" in the car!
