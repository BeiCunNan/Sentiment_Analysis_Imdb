This is really not a very good comedy. Although I have enjoyed watching Corolla as a comedian and on such Comedy Central shows as "The Man Show", this is a poorly assembled, no-surprise comedy.<br /><br />I guess the real benchmark in a comedy is whether it makes you laugh or not. This one doesn't have much that even made the group I was watching it with laugh...or even grin.<br /><br />There's no chemistry at all between Corolla and the female lead. A long, long, long scene at the La Brea Tar Pits just feels like the Woody Allen scene with Diane Keaton in the planetarium from "Manhattan". Redone.<br /><br />I did enjoy the actor playing the Nicaraguan sidekick, but its not enough to recommend you wasting 91 minutes of time on this.<br /><br />Sad to say I bought it from a clearance table at a video store. Something should have told me it was a turkey seeing the large stack of them for sale at $6.<br /><br />You're funnier than this, Adam...I expected more.<br /><br />One star.
