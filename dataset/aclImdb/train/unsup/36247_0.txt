Whew, what a mess. They don't make 'em like this anymore and we should all be thankful that they don't. Samuel Goldwyn pulled out all the stops to present a movie with a bit of everything and created one heck of a mess. Any film with a talent like Adolf Menjou sharing the bill with an act like The Ritz Brothers should be an indication that something here isn't quite right.<br /><br />And who are The Ritz Brothers? A weak attempt at imitating the success of the Marx Brother's that failed miserably.<br /><br />Watch if you're curious but if you're in the mood for the best that era had to offer rent the "That's Entertainment" trilogy from MGM, a studio that really knew how to put on a show.
