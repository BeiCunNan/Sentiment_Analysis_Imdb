This is one of the most difficult movies I have labored to get through. I'm not trying to be witty when I say that War of the Robots makes Starcrash look like Revenge of the Sith. The effects are so poorly done that it's a wonder why this was even made. Much to my surprise, this is actually the fourth of five, yes five, of these sci-fi films made with basically the same cast. A group of android aliens kidnap a scientist and his assistant Lois in order to save their race. The androids are a group of thirty year old men dressed in silver jump suits with blond bowl-cut wigs. Antonio Sabato plays Captain John Boyd who leads the mission to recover the Dr. and Lois, whom he is enamored with much to the chagrin of his fellow crew-member Julie. The Julie character is very disturbing due to the abnormally butch haircut given her. Picture a junior high boy with great boobs. Disturbing anyone? By the way, in the future bras are nonexistent.<br /><br />Everything about this film stinks! Characters change allegiances then change back without any explanations whatsoever. The dialogue is about as enthralling as listening to a tax seminar. Even the name of the ship, the Trissi, sucks. I was trying to think of why they used such an odd name for the ship until I saw the ending credits. Yep, Trissi Sport supplied the costumes! The dubbing is horrendous as is most notable in one character that has the worst Texan accent ever. The music soundtrack is absolutely putrid. I've heard songs preprogrammed on an old Casio better than this. The weapons consist of flashlight guns with no lasers. At one point in the film the sound of the gun disappears making the scenes even more absurd. The final duel in space is even worse. At a mind-numbing one hour and thirty nine minutes I was reduced to a shell of my former self. This is truly the gutter of science fiction films. Avoid at all costs!
