The third picture featuring Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry. Clint Eastwood resumes his role as Police Inspector Harry Callahan; Tyne Daly plays the role of Inspector Kate Moore and Harry Guadino as Lt Al Bressler. Harry gets into one of his usual predicaments when his is relegated to Personnel to help interview patrol officers on the list to make inspector. While filling his duties in personnel he learns that there are eight openings for inspector and three of those eight will be filled by woman. A group of people who call themselves the People's Revolutionary Strike Force (PRSF), led by Bobby Maxwell, are making plans to go on a crime spree all over the city of San Francisco. When Dirty Harry's longtime partner is killed by the PRSF during a major weapons theft, Dirty Harry vows revenge and, surprisingly, is given some support by his superiors. Harry has one problem, he's given a new partner and it's non other then a lady inspector. After the Mayor of San Francisco is taken its up to Harry and his new partner are expecting to find him. All and all I give this movie 8 weasel stars.
