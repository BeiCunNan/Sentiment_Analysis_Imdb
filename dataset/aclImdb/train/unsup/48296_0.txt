Well the cover looked grate, but the film was pure sh.... Can't say it nicer. Really who came up with such a stupid story. Other filmmaker in the world is trying to get funding, then people get money to make sh... like this? the people giving this film funding must really be angry and feeling misled. I mean a Hitler with transvestite attitude and jerking off while in the middle of a fight etc. This film should never have been made, it destroys the market for real filmmakers. <br /><br />And what was used to film it, handy-cam? the story was a big bag of crap and the actors really could have been better, some OK, but the one playing "Hitler" have been doing to much school-plays or theater not film. Well he sucked anyway. A real waste of money. Well people should buy it and burn it.
