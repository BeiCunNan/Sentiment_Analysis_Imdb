Even though the time since I watched this piece of cinematic history fades away I feel compelled to document my personal experience with the motion picture.<br /><br />Even though this film is bound by about as much storyline as the ingredients on a packet of Special K, it manages to keep the mild interest of the viewer through a string of scantily clad females, naked dancing and what could only be described as bouts of randomness.<br /><br />The film starts off with an old fellow heading up to a castle, and I think I pretty much lost the plot from thereafter. It may be a combination of poor scripting or the fact I was rather tired at the point of watching this... in either case, I was unable to twig to the supposed outline of 'A doctor and the Devil battle for the soul of a beautiful woman'.<br /><br />Another 'glueing' factor of the film is that throughout one feels compelled to keep watching in the event of anticipated intercourse. To the credit (or not) of the director, the nudity remained tasteful throughout the film.<br /><br />A roller-coaster ride which keeps you coming back for more.
