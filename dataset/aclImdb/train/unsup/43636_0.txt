Like in many of their previous movies twins again failed at their latest attempt to portray themselves as serious actors. <br /><br />Like many of their past movies only true twins fans can really enjoy this movie that lacks a decent plot line. Jaycee Chan (son of Jackie Chan) makes his first and only appearance to date in a film and after seeing his poor performance I recommend that he stick with music.<br /><br />The only bright part to this poorly made movie is the small appearance of Jackie Chan to add some flavour to this movie.<br /><br />To all the twins fans out their you would probably enjoy this but to all the other serious movie goers I would not really recommend it.
