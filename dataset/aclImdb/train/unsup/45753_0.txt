This movie is a propaganda piece against net neutrality. Diane Lane is (or rather was) a favorite actor of mine, and I am disappointed that she would participate in a piece of garbage like this. Beside the fact that "Untraceable" is a shameless hit piece against net neutrality, it is also tasteless in its display of extreme cruelty, the kind which makes one wonder about the screenwriter's mental health. Shocking scenes notwithstanding, the movie is filled with clich√©s and archetypal characters, played by actors who outclass the hackneyed script. Was it necessary to utilize Diane Lane and Colin Hanks when the latest Playboy centerfold-turned-actress, and, I don't know, maybe Chuck Norris or Steven Seagal could have easily fit the bill?
