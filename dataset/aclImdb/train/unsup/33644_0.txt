the title says it all, "I am the Cheese". This movie is nothing but cheesy.<br /><br />The movie makes no sense at all for those who haven't read the book, it makes a little sense to those who have read the book.<br /><br />The acting is terrible, the character lacked charisma it's almost like they are reading from a script.<br /><br />And last of all, the movie is boring, they are good boring movies like " lost in Translation" etc. This movie is everything you don't want you movie to be.<br /><br />Anyway, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. It's the ultimate embarrassment if anyone catch you watching this. The book is a worth read but STAY AWAY FORM THIS
