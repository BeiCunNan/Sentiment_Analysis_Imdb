Having been taking photos and videos of the places I travel to (not least Thailand and Bangkok which is one of my favorite cities on earth) I can assure you that anyone who is capable of holding a camera in a hand and can speak and is not an alien from Mars can make a similar 'documentary' about pretty much anything and 'prove' any point or hypothesis. Having observed the sex scene of Thailand (and other countries) from a close-up myself I can express nothing but a sad smile looking at this 'documentary' which is nothing about even a fair attempt to depict the scene and the industry that has taken so many women (men as well) in Thailand. I would suggest the authors of this 'documentary' to get into some books (or Wikipedia at the very least) and have some read about Thai culture and history before putting 'farangs' anywhere near the center of the issue. I could write a lot more but I guess it's just not worth it. My recommendation to those willing to watch this: don't bother. Better buy a ticket to Bangkok and see the amazing city and amazing country for yourself. And there i no need to be afraid to get to the places where those girls are doing their business. They won't bite. Perhaps they could even tell you their own story.<br /><br />All in all this is a piece of an amateurish documentary film-making which perhaps could not get it any worse.
