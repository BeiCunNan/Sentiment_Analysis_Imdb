Okay, I know there is some controversy as to whether part III or IV is the better sequel. After seeing this one, I have to say that I was disappointed in this installment. It didn't have the humor that we crave, the excitement or the ultra violence that the others had.<br /><br />The best part of this one is the explanations of where The Tall Man came from. These scenes are very interesting. This whole movie ties in so well with the deleted scenes of the first one, though, it is obvious the director is making this up as he goes along. There are very few characters in this one b\c it focuses on The Tall Man's relationship with Mike (yet, of course, like the others not explaining all we need to know!). Reggie is severely downplayed, and I'm sorry but Reggie Bannister is the one of the main reasons these films are entertaining. I wanting to drown in my beer at the horrible one liners Reggie was given in this one (and I mean HORRIBLE). I thought the whole ice cream man uniform at the end was a little gay, though funny. Yet, the movie is okay on it's own. There isn't much action except at the end, there are a ton of plot hole (PLEASE! Someone tell me how Reggie escaped The Tall Man from being pinned up by the spheres at the beginning. This drove me crazy throughout the whole movie! Did he just LET HIM GO?!?).<br /><br />Anyways, a below average movie...waaayyyy too slow, and not paced nearly as well as the other movies (the fast pacing makes them more exciting). Only for true Phantasm lovers, I did enjoy what this movie was, but unlike the others, I will never watch this one again. 5/10 stars.
