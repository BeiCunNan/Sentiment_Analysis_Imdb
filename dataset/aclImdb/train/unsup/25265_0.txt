I saw this on my birthday....and what an experience! It was as if you were in the Royal Albert Hall that night. Robbie Williams sings all the classic songs from the great performers of the 50's such as 'Sammy Davis Jnr', 'Dean Martin' and of course 'Frank Sinatra' in a style which befits their songs. He throws himself completely into their shoes, delivering each song as if he were singing in that era, whilst poking fun at himself and encouraging the audience to have a good time. Robbie also pays homage to those great singers, never attempting to steal any of their thunder, but merely wanting to present these songs to a new generation. Also, the audience isn't a mob of screaming teenagers, but a host of mature adults in tuxedos and elegant evening wear. The music backing Robbie isn't a small band, but a magnificent orchestra, and Robbie himself wears the trademark 50s tux, complete with a lose tie. Though be warned....during the breaks between the songs he reverts to his regular persona and there is some strong language (only 4 or 5 times) which may offend, but don't let that put you off. The singing is what counts and it will get you swinging!!
