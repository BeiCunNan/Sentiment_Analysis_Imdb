Its no wonder that ITV has dropped both David and Frank, I for one am glad about this. This show, when first seen was bright, fresh and most importantly funny. One thing that I notice to make me go off the two is how much they relish their title as celebrity and will bully anyone in the audience if the say something to know them. When some does knock them they really take it to heart that 'A mere mortal has stood up to them' and will quickly ask about their fashion or take a dig at their looks (If they are not very attractive).<br /><br />Take in to fact the both Frank and David look like tramps and are the ugliest people in to studio I find this ironic. The bulling become more harsh as the gags got weak, which was about half was thought the second series. David I found was the worst for pointing out peoples problems and I found it funny when someone asked him if he thought that he was nothing with Frank. To see this guy who thought that he was a God brought down to his knees by a *Nobody* was kind of nice.<br /><br />The show is over now and so is David and Franks bulling, The BBC don't want them back, ITV told them to go and now frank is trying to start his stand-up career again where he left off.
