I didn't watch Ridget by Lars Von Trier. I just saw this series collection box at a store, was FOOLED by it's cover and bought it. Hey, I'm not the first who falls into that tale. So I am here to alert you. What is this Kingdom Hospital about anyway? Do we have ghosts of little girls, do we have blood gushing out someone's eyes? No. This series is supposed to be something like "bizarre dark comedy". But you do not laugh. You do not cry. You won't be scared or confused. You will be looking at your TV screen cursing the advertising studio that made that ludicrous DVD cover. And asking yourself "hey, what happened to Stephen King? Did he eat some rotten tacos before doing that?" Yes, he probably did.<br /><br />The thing is, if you're going to make something about a hospital with bizarre sense of humor, you should create an atmosphere in there. I felt like I was watching ER second season after ingesting some cough medicine bottles. And it wasn't fun as it sounds.<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />I never thought that someone would think that a anteater could be threatening. Those quiet animals NOT even have teeth. They eat ants for crissake! A angry koala would more scary than a "anteater from the underworld". WATCH OUT! IS THE LONG TONGUE OF DOOM! Blah.
