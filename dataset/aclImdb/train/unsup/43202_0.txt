Hoo dawgies, what can I say about this movie that has been said before and better by other people? I'm not sure. Well, I'll try<br /><br />To start off with, I'm not sure why the aliens in the film are the Titular "Pod People". The "pods" they come from look very much like overlarge chickens eggs. When I think of pods, I think of long sacs or chrysilii (whatever the plural for that is) that the aliens burst out of. Thus, we get no Pod People. We get Egg People. Secondly, while we're on the alien kick, FEEL I HAVE BEEN CHEATED. The opening sequence shows scenes of green, sinister-looking aliens putting hurt on some camper-type people. Unfortunately, it seems this is the only point in the film we see these scenes. The aliens we get are not green and menacing, but brown, hirsute, and ALF-rip-offing. Sure, they can put up a fight and leave glowing spots on their victims foreheads for no other reason than to give the special effects department something to do, but most of the time they just jam with a Simon game and make stop-motion stuff happen all around an effeminate boy's room. And the campers they encounter couldn't be more irritating. There's a pop group and friends that sings a confusing song, three clumsy poachers of varying scary facial-hairyness (one having too much, one having none at all, and one just looking "blah"), and a family consisting of said girlboy (who has a pet for each day of the week, plus "Trumpy" the alien.), his mother (who always seems to call him from the door entering the hallway to his room, rather than stand in his doorway OR ENTERING THE FRIGGIN HALLWAY HERSELF), and a grumpy old uncle (who loves his booze.)<br /><br />I'm not sure what else to say. It's just a mess. If you're with a group and you're rather giddy, you might have some fun taking potshots at it. If not, "It STINKS!"
