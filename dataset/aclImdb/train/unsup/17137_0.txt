This was my introduction into Rock and Roll. My mother paid for my friends and me to see this movie on my 12th birthday. It was running with the Lords of Flatbush. After the movie I just had to find out who those performers were. I did not understand how the audience knew the words to all those songs I had never heard. This movie was very influential in my life. I had seen Bill Haley and the Comets of course. I knew of Chuck Berry, but it seems he did "My Dingaling" and reelin' and rockin'. These were very controversial lyrics. Also I only knew Robert Riener from "All in the family" I did not know he was a director. I did find this movie for sale here http://shop.vendio.com/supersounds/item/944867200/index.html
