THERE MAY BE SPOILERS BUT YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN BE CONSIDERING WATCHING THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />On the face of it this was a fairly tempting no brainer movie  the premise of the overrated (but not bad) original pasted onto the eighties slasher movie template  a touch of continuation with the Bobby, one of the survivors and Ruby, the feral girl (and the family dog, who gets his own flashback  draw your own conclusions!) from the original and the promise of much inspired teenager-slashing in the desert.<br /><br />They are hooked up with some motocross riders and their girlfriends (one of the girls is blind and has Daredevil like enhanced senses  I am not making this up) and heading to a meet in some unspecified place to test out Bobby's newly developed super-fuel (they're carrying gallons of the stuff  deus ex machina alert!)<br /><br />The kids decide to leave the highway and head across country thanks to one of the stupidest plot contrivances in cinematic history  they forget that the clocks went forward the night before  all of them!! This happened about twenty minutes in and I kept watching!!! More fool, me.<br /><br />From there on its the usual predictable nonsense and features Michael Berryman (with a REAL tenuous explanation of his survival from part one) and a super lame villain (its Jupiter's brother!!) who looks like a retired wrestler with a big fat gut (y'know  he's fat  just run away!!)<br /><br />None of this should be completely damning  there are a million pointless, predictable slasher flicks but some of them actually have a touch of originality  even if its only in the way the cast are killed off.<br /><br />Boy does this movie fail  did Craven just take the budget and spend it on drugs? At least fifteen minutes of its overlong eighty six are taken up with flashbacks from the original (and not even the good bits from the original!)  the killings are bloodless and stupid and the killers are about as menacing as a drunk uncle at Christmas. And don't get me started on the ending...<br /><br />This is the kind of dull, lazy, artless, stupid, `will this do?' filmmaking that gives horror cinema its bad name. It isn't even entertainingly bad  its just bad and should be in IMDB's 100 worst.<br /><br />Pointless  avoid. You have been warned. 1 out of 10 only cos theres no zero option.
