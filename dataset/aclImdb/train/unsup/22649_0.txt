You can tell from the first moments of "The Smokers." If the shooting medium isn't DV, it's 16mm. The sound is passable (often a distinguishing feature between the good, bad, and ugly films). While it seems like the acting simply sucks, I think it's more the writing and/or direction. It's a immature story of private school girls who like to say "shlong" (it means "penis," for the uninitiated) and makes allusions to a sexually violent (on a man...at least that's a change in things) act of revenge act being empowering, something NOW should condone. It's insipid. Better to find something on cable. Maybe the currently-popular "The Osbournes" on re-run. The soundtrack is O.K., but nothing you'd go out and buy for even a single track. Maybe if you could just hear the music and see the scenes of the girls smoking pot in an endless loop, it'd pass for an art film. In leiu of that, just pass.
