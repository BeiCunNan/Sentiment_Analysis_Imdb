When porn first went "mainstream," it did so with a series of big screen feature films like this one from 1978. Unlike the adult films of today, movies back then aspired to be "real" entertainment. While this movie has all the depth of a Keystone Kops movie, the effort at storytelling and real movie making is clearly there. From wacky characters suitable for a hardcore sex-romp, it also features real sets, locations, and even costumes. In general, the sex scenes, while explicit, are very short. Yes, all the action is clearly shown, including porn's infamous "money shots," but gone are most of the super close-ups of body parts connecting. One gets the sense that the movie makers were more interested in showing their actors having real sex in near real time. Also absent are the implants and finely honed bodies so popular today. Additionally, as is true with most seventies erotica, the women are presented ala natural. It's main character, as portrayed by Desiree Cousteau started her movie-making career as a mainstream actress in B movies. Unable to achieve any real success, she transitioned into adult films and remained popular for many years.
