My AP US History teacher recommended this film to my class and I think it was an exceptional work of art. I was compelled throughout the whole film, watching every single scene with interest. Bluteau does a great job with his character as a Jesuit Priest and I believe that watching this will boost my knowledge of the Jesuits and will help me later on with the AP History test. I feel that this film should have been more acknowledged amongst the "society" because it shows what a film really should be made of. Not all films are supposed to be action-packed, whereas this film touches the mind and maybe the soul of those who believe in the Native American spirits. I recommend this film to all who are interested in North American history or just want to watch a good movie. If you feel against this, email me for a good argument. =)
