Al Pacino, a forensic college professor and psychiatrist, helped put away a kinky serial killer who specialises in torturing women who he hangs upside down. The killer is on death row and on and around the day that he is scheduled to die similar murders take place and Pacino gets a death threat that he himself has 88 minutes to live. Is it a copycat killer or is the guy on death row innocent? Well Pacino has to find out who is behind his death threat and find out who the killer is in an hour and twenty-eight minutes...<br /><br />The film's good points - It has Al Pacino in it, it's a fast paced thriller with lots going on.<br /><br />The film's bad points - besides Pacino all the other actors are b-grade, it starts off OK but turns into one of those predictable and tedious thrillers with surprise twists that a 5 year old could have figured out. It has ridiculous scenarios throughout and some of the scenes are completely cringe worthy....<br /><br />I would like to know what Pacino was on while reading the script, because I don't believe that an actor of his caliber would agree to do this film while stone cold sober.
