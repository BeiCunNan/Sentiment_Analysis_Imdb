It could have been worse. This movie is at the low end of expectations for a made for tv film. Fortunately, it is not available on DVD or VHS tape and had to be taped off of tv with commercials intact, but zappable. Most of the bad acting can probably be blamed on the script, because it is hard to conclude that what is up on the tv screen is nothing less than corny. The movie begins realistically enough but quickly goes downhill with lots of the dialog feeling forced and overly sentimental. At least Nastassja Kinski has the lead role as the scientist who has to find a cure for a bio-warfare, fatal virus. She and her on-screen daughter are the only ones to escape from the script alive and only because of Nastassja's screen presence that carries most of the scenes that she is in. Early on, Nastassja, dressed in a black Ninja type outfit, is a member of a destroy mission, somewhat reminiscent of Nikita of "La Femme Nikita," the tv series. Then she is plunged into a poorly thought out remake of "The Andromeda Strain," but without the aid of Michael Crichton. If the script were actually realistic, then we poor American citizens are in a world of trouble because the so-called national security is not even second rate, but probably fifth rate. If the writers are smart, they would be wise to never admit that they wrote this script because it has been very poorly researched with god-awful dialog and situations that only a real professional like Nastassja can escape, including a scene that seems to have been lifted out of "Paris, Texas." Most of the acting is hammy and some might find that amusing or something to laugh at because it is so bad.
