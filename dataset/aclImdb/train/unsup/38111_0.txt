You don't really appreciate mediocre actors until you've seen some godawful ones. And there are plenty of them in here.<br /><br />That's okay, though, see, because everything else about this movie is just as godawful. I'll have to second the other reviewers' acrimonious bashing of this film, and offer the following additions:<br /><br />Fans of horror movies quickly become inured to bad movies, since bad movie makers all too often start out in this genre. But nothing can prepare you for badness such as this.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is amateurish! Not even 'good' amateurish; you won't get any Blair Witch vibes here. It's so amateurish that you can safely defy anyone involved to _spell_ the word; I've seen kindergarten school plays with better writing, better production and better acting than this. And that is the feeling you get when you watch this; that it's some high-school student film project which got misplaced and by some horrible freak accident wound up on the shelves of the video store. It's so bad it isn't even funny.<br /><br />When I saw this a few months ago, some emergency (such as the need to clip my toenails) prevented me from finishing it. So I don't know how it came out. But I simply cannot be arsed to find out. This is 20 minutes of my life better spent watching infomercials.<br /><br />Yeeech!
