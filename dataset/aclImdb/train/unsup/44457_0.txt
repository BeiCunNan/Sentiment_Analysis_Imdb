A brutal western morality tale starring Henry Fonda as the "mayor" of a tiny frontier town whose courage is tested when deranged outlaw Aldo Ray runs rampant burning buildings, raping saloon girl Janice Rule and killing anyone who stands up to him. Directed by the efficient Burt Kennedy and based on an early E.L. Doctorow novel, WELCOME TO HARD TIMES isn't great by any stretch, but it is involving and features some great acting. Fonda, Keenan Wynn, and Warren Oates are excellent. The great Janis Paige sings a couple of Christmas songs. Highly trained actress Rule affects an Irish accent like a highly trained actress. Ray, in a nearly silent role, is suitably nasty.
