This film is very funny. The character development is extremely shallow, but you can't argue with the guest stars in this movie. The cast is loaded with lots of famous folks doing cameos.<br /><br />This turned out to be Richard Kiels last performance. He was always a busy character actor. Of course, legend Bob Barker does an amazing sequence.<br /><br />Adam stars as a hockey player who decides to try golf. The premise is just enough to hang the humor on. Once he starts, he turns out to be more of an oddity than any golfer around. Once you scrap reality, it works. How this sequence with Barker worked out is so amazing.<br /><br />People at Price is Right were asking Barker to repeat his line at the tapings even when he was getting ready to retire.<br /><br />This is a movie to put your brain in neutral & enjoy the humor.
