Okay, maybe I did like Deep Blue Sea, and maybe I have been wanting to see a movie based on Meg by Steve Alten. BUT this movie is total CRAP!!!! The acting is horrible, the CGI is so so and the explanations for the megalodon are totally stupid. Why did Isaacs bother? I'm guessing he thought he'd try and make a buck off the success of Alten's Meg, but he FAILED, and FAILED terribly. I understand that Leighann Litrell is married to a Backstreat Boy and good for her, but her acting is totally shitty. I hope the Backstreat Boy's new CD does well--otherwise this poor girl will starve. Okay, anyway I am really looking forward to "Meg" being made into a movie and I hope it's done right.
