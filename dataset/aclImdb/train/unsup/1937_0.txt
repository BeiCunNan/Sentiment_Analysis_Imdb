Jaws 3 is certainly an improvement from Jaws 2 and ranks behind the original Jaws as the series best. This third installment finds a great white shark who wreaks havoc at a aquatic Florida amusement park. This Jaws features some great scenes that are very thrilling and chilling the music is great and the setting of this Jaws film is what makes it so good. The acting is at the very top of the scale with Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong let me also mention Lea Thompson all three at this time were very young making this work their earliest roles. As always Louis Gossett Jr. is great. Jaws 3 runs enough on cable at just anytime during the years and try the video store and add this great sequel to your video library collection.
