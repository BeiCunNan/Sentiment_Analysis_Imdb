They say that a defendant who represents himself has a fool for a client. Well, Cuba is one of the Producers of this film and he obviously needs to be protected from himself. He's a fine comic actor but his little smirks, quizzical looks and mugging to the camera just don't work when he's playing the dramatic lead. He's not the only person who's miscast. Marianne-Jeanne Baptiste, so wonderful in 'Secrets and Lies' looks like she has stumbled into the wrong movie. Best (or worst) of all this movie boasts the worst disguise since Jane March in 'Color of Night' - if you don't spot it within the first 10 seconds and then work out the whole plot, then shame on you, you're no movie buff. Destined for DTV or DTTV - don't expect to see this in your local movie theatre.
