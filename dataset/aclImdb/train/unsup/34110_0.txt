This is not Norm Macdonald funny, this is not even Carrotop funny. Every gag fails, the movie is shot in dark, depressing colors which only drive the "sad, very sad" message straight to the subconscious. This movie is a shining of example on how not to make a slapstick meets a crazy twisting plot movie.
