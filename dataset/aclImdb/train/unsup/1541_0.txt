A great movie about high adventure on the seas, with ships being wrecked, pirating, and two beautiful women vieing for the love of two handsome and bold sailors. John Wayne and Robert Preston plays two brothers in love with two cousins Paulette Goddard and Susan Hayward. Action packed, even a scene of them going deep into the depths of the ocean. Scenes well done. Ray Miland plays a fop who is after Paulette Goddard who only has eyes for John Wayne. Susan Hayward plays a small part as the sweetheart of Robert Preston. Color is great, costumes very in tune with the period. This is another one of my favorites. One of John Wayne's best films.
