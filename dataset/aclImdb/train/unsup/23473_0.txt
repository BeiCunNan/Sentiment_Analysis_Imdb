I just loved this film. Yes, it's silly and the plot and dialogue could be better, but it has the makings of a cult. I'm not a fan of slasher films, but I was intrigued by this because it's the first gay slasher film. Some of the photography was simply beautiful (the blood from the tattoo, the motorcycle ride, the bedroom scene). I've read criticism of Kirkwood's performance (Jake), that he seems uncomfortable, but he's playing a damaged, possibly broken hearted character, so his discomfort/awkwardness could be part of his performance. I think the scenes at the end, where he's vulnerable and clingy, are very well underplayed, poignant. The only criticism I have is that it's too short. At 85 minutes, there would have been plenty of time (at least 10 minutes) to give us a bit more story - I was dying to see Tobey (Matt Phillips) properly out of drag! I'd like to see a sequel, but I think if they were going to make one, they'd have made it by now... Or, six years later, the psycho killer could have escaped and is hellbent (hehe) on tracking down Jake and Eddie (who are still together and in love of course... or maybe they've split up (over some trivial misunderstanding) and the new danger brings them back together for a bitter reunion... but in the end they realise they still love each other... I could go on...) I want to see more films like this.
