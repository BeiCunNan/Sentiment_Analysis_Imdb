Whatever you think of this misguided and silly film, please don't tell Mary Louis Parker, Billy Crudup's girlfriend, he stunk big time in this disaster because she might not like you, and hit you, the same way she hit some fan who was bad-mouthing Billy in his last stage appearance in New York.<br /><br />Whatever was Cate Blanchett thinking when she accepted the title role in this stupid little number? No one can believe for a moment all the goings and comings the screenwriter has plotted at the expense of truth and reality. I'm afraid that our Cate really has to have her little head examined and maybe one day she'll fess up the real reasons for getting near this project that makes absolute no sense at all, let alone the preposterous situation which situates "la Blanchett" in that God forsaken little town where she sticks out like a sore thumb. <br /><br />Billy Crudup is totally out of place in the company of people like Michael Gambon, or even Cate. His character is totally unbelievable and we cannot think of him as the brains behind all the work against the invading Nazi army.<br /><br />Sorry Ms. Armstrong, better luck next time. We have admired your work before, but films like these are beneath your best abilities. Try to get involved in an Australian theme, one that you're more familiar with, and give us something more dignified than Charlotte Gray, who, by the way, doesn't even have to change her name at all because no one could have cared less if she was Gray, Brown, Green, Black, Blue, Black, or just plain Jane Doe!
