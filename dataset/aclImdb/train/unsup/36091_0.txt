Well, I make it short: Don't watch the German version of the movie... the people who did the dubbing should rather be doing other things in their sparetime. The whole audio part seems to be messed up... non-credible voices, and unintentional strange noises and sound.<br /><br />Besides that the plot seems to be very much constructed and you never really get to know the characters, everything seems to be very superficial.<br /><br />The only thing I liked about the movie are the significant pictures and some weird disturbing images.<br /><br />Sorry, that's not enough to make it a good movie. :o(
