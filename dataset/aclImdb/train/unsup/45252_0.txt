I guess this movie might be okay for children or people who don't know much about horses...but I have never seen a more poorly researched movie! As an equestrian I laughed through the entire movie at the ridiculousness of it all. THEY HAD THE HORSE BACKWARDS IN THE TRAILER!!! Other than the major oversights with regard to horses and owning horses, the movie was cheesy and terribly predictable. I was incredibly surprised to see that the movie was not very old - it seems like something that would have been released in the late 80s or early 90s. It was clearly outdated. If you want to see a good horse movie, rent Seabiscuit, or if you're looking for something a little more kid friendly, Dreamer or National Velvet.
