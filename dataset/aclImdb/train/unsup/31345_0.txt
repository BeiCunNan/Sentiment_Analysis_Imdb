there isn't much to say about ncis except that it is a perfect piece of crap, one of the worst shows i've ever seen in my whole life.. starting from the horrible soundtrack that gets on my nerves every time they play it.. i think the composer should get the prize of the best "torture masterpiece" on TV.. the characters are really dull, starting from the arrogant, antipathetic Mr knowitall Jethro Gibbs, to the dull sheepish McGee, the stupid, antipathetic DiNozzo, the freak Abby by the way there's always some freakish nerds in such shows who behind her weird looks hides exceptional genius and wit.. so classic! and so boring! the plot is far too simple almost childish, no suspense no real action, and full of clich√©s.. the principle character doesn't really do a damn thing, with a sick sense of humor, he just goes insulting people here and there showing what the show creators think is an exceptional power of character - the guy fears no one and behaves as if he were president of the United States (he perfectly fits in a context where Dubya is twice elected for president)and then all of a sudden, he miraculously finds the solution to the case!!! no effort, no logical proceeding, just like that! I have serious doubts about the taste of those who highly rated this show!!!
