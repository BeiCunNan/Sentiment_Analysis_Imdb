This is a funny movie, and it's clever. If you don't get the jokes it's a problem with your sense of humor, not the writing. <br /><br />By the way, the movie was made for $26,000. If it had jaw-dropping special fx and make-up at that budget, it should've won an Oscar.<br /><br />It's entertainment, plain and simple. It's fun. Nudity, hunting clubs, and post-its are funny here. The scene in the sheriff's office with the corpse dumping is great.<br /><br />And once again people, I'd like to point out that it was $26,000. Which means that all you can afford is film, a camera, and a few props, so the rest is riding on the imagination of the writers/directors. Anyone can make something that you can eat popcorn to for a couple of hours with a big budget. And it will be palatable to the masses. But making something original and funny on a shoe-string budget is an accomplishment.<br /><br />Anyways, it's worth a watch.
