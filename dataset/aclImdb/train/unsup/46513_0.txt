I watched this show with my parents. They shot each other shortly after the opening 5 minutes of this show. And I was planning to shoot myself too, but they hogged all the bullets. If there is anyone that reads this and that was in the show, you should follow my parents example and shoot yourself. Or someone might throw you into a train. But I feel bad for you because there's no chance you'll ever get a job in the acting field again, not that anyone watched this sh*tty show for that matter. Well anyways the show was a f*cking disaster on wheels, and if you plan on watching this show, make sure you have a gun, or a balcony, or a noose or something. Thanks for reading.
