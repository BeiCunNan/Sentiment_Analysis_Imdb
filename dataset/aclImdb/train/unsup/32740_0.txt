It is a complete catastrophic ruining of one of the greatest epic fantasy books. It seems that whoever wrote a script for this movie didn't cast a glance to this Ursula K. Le Guin's masterpiece. The original storyline was almost completely changed, the characters were awfully presented, even the names and appearance of some of them were wrongfully represented, and many events that happened in the movie are nonexistent. Since I've read the book one day before watching the movie, I even didn't manage to find the meaning of making a movie by the book in the manner this movie was filmed. It gives totally different picture of almost all characters that appear in the book, skips the events of great importance for the story and make up the events that ruin the atmosphere and the story itself. Dreadful experience...
