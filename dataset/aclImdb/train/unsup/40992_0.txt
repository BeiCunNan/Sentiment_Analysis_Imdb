Having just watched the first 4 episodes on Sci-Fi, just to see what the big deal was all about ( and because the writer strike ), I can not fathom why there was such a strong call for this show to be "saved".<br /><br />I can suspend belief when it comes to TV shows, hence my knowing it was on Sci-Fi, but i can not even comprehend how this show lasted past episode 4. The MASSIVE plot holes should have sank it after episode 2. The poor acting thru episode 4 should have have buried it. If I ever watch another episode, it will have been just to have more ammo to come back here and say again, just how wasted an idea this was, and how worse it has gotten.<br /><br />Sad that this show was renewed, and Firefly died after 13 episodes.. shame on CBS for not keeping to there guns after canceling, and shame on FOX for pulling the trigger too soon...
