Malcolm McDowell narrates his own rise as a gangster in this lukewarm crime drama. Gangster films are a dime a dozen, so you need something unique to say or at least great acting. This film fails on the first part, and passes barely only thanks to Paul Bennany and David Thewlis on the second. It also goes on for too long and could've used a better editor at the helm. It's not that "Gangster No. 1" is a particularly bad film, as it's not. The acting by the two aforementioned actors and the cinematography make it watchable, but it's just not one that you can't miss if you're a fan of the genre.<br /><br />My Grade: C <br /><br />DVD Extras: Commentary with director Paul McGuinan; one Deleted scene; Featurette; TV Spot; and Theatrical Trailer <br /><br />ANTI-eye Candy: Some bloke's wang
