When I was a little girl, at 5, I watched this cartoon and was amazed by it's beauty, matureness and lovely music and backgrounds. It is very moralful to kids and very emotionally touching as people learn lessons throughout life, such as Flora seeing how people would work their hardest to provide for others, (even in the dead of night!) teaching her to be more respectful and more caring and concern for the benefit of other people, that are less fortunate then her. Also to not bad mouth about those shes loves and to bring out the good side of things of all she stands for. Other lessons such as Harsh, emotionally scared ones such as getting your life endangered by a poisonous snake and ending up in a coma. Alexander willing to make up for upsetting other people and endangering the lives of others. Pom learning to be honest and right and to be more confident. And to face up to faults and problems that you cause to people and improve your character. This cartoon is the greatest influence on my life that will stick with me forever:)
