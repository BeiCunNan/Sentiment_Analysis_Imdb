Khamosh Pani a.k.a Silent Waters (Urdu/Punjabi-English Subtitles) is an extra-ordinary feature film i've ever seen till date. It is totally belongs to Sabiha Sumar all the way. In short it is totally a Director's Film. Every scene of this film shows and portrays the hard work gone into it.<br /><br />Every actor in this film performs very well. Especially Kirron Kher & Amir Mallik steals the show.<br /><br />I think this film is a treat to watch. Every frame of this film has something to say and discuss. A truly learning cinema. Sabiha Sumar gives a work of Masterpiece in her debut. Kudos to the film maker for revealing such a beautiful cinema!!!
