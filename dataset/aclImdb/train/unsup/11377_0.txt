I liked this movie not just because it shows an important part of our history, but because it helps others (non Hungarians) to understand us better. I even liked that the movie follows the typical Hollywood building schema which helps the North American population to get into the mood easier and follow the plot. I agree the actors were not always at the top of their game, but this is something easy to overlook with the excellent story leading and the world class visual effects. For me the most important part was the ending of the movie, when the Hungarian national anthem plays (pictures showing to very different places) and I turned to my friend (who is a born Canadian) watching the movie with me: "You can understand now, why we have tears in our eyes when our national-anthem plays... And he understood.
