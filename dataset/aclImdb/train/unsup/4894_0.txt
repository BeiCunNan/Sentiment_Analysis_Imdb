It's not 'throw it away' bad but it's not a total turn-on either. We've had this one on the shelf for the longest time without ever trying it out. I can't remember why we bought it.<br /><br />It doesn't have the world's best screenplay or the world's most thought out story line. It's - how should one say? It's a light comedy not written all that well (yes I know sorry Babaloo but it really isn't that good not even close) that hops skips and jumps. Don't look for too much realism here, and don't look for even that much. Much of the story in the seams doesn't make any sense. So it's hard to say what this one's about, but it's easy to say whose movie this is.<br /><br />There's not much of a fight over it either.<br /><br />She doesn't quite look the role but she does good at it: Shelley Long. Winkler is so totally laid back and the plot continually turns macabre against him. Keaton is so over the top you're likely to feel like Winkler by the end of the movie (which might be the idea). Keaton's supposed to be the one who's so good here, but his character is just downright stupid - an ass. Which isn't really funny at all. Nope - Shelley saves the day. Keaton you can kick and leave in a back alley and things will be really fine - he's not even close to being critical to the plot line - but dump Shelley back there and Ron Howard's venture dies.<br /><br />Look for a very noodle-like Mr Noodle here - in other words Kevin Costner. The party scene. He's the one marching behind Keaton. Shannen Doherty is supposedly in here too but I haven't seen her and mostly likely won't hurry back to look again. (They say she's in the lift; I still won't go back, as in 'go back for what'.) For that matter there are a lot of familiar faces in here. You might not know their names, but you'll go 'oh yeah so-and-so'.<br /><br />Some familiar music, some of which you may like; some nice moments - the first breakfast scene is nice; some sentimentality; but don't look for a story that makes too much sense and has you feeling totally good inside by the end, for you won't be like that - you'll feel somewhat empty but of course not fully empty. It's the screenplay - hopping skipping jumping - contrived.<br /><br />But totally bad it's not, although were it not for Shelley it might be. It just isn't a total turn-on.
