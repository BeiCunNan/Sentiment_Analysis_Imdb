Must watch this movie at some stage for its sheer awfulness. It is absolutely NOT a slasher movie as slashers only kill with machetes, blades and other piercing weapons. The killer's usage of guns automatically removes the movie from the slasher genre. In any study of the slasher movement this rule is evident. I recommend Carol Clover's book, 'Men, Women and Chainsaws' or Adam Rockoff's book 'Going to Pieces' and the documentary of the same name for more on these rules.The documentary is particularly excellent, filled with clips from movies like this (movies that think they're slasher pics because they are sequels to slashers) and 'real' slasher classics. In short- Guns may be used to injure and kill the killer, but usually s/he will survive this to return for the sequel... It's just grates my guts when shoot out movies are called slasher movies... oh and this movie is so awful, it's hilarious. I think the actors weren't paid, the script was written day to day and the movie thought it was a lethal weapon movie. very very very bad LOL!
