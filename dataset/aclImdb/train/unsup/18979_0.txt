I thought Sweet Hideaway was a good movie. I found it to be very entertaining. I knew it was an independent film prior to my viewing it, so I did not go to see it expecting a "Feature Film" presentation. I especially liked the family scene with the Aunt and the little boy. The coach was hilarious (although he did go a little over board with the profane language). It was nice seeing all the new faces (actors) in the movie. Everyone did a great job!<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the movie!
