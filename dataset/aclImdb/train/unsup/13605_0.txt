Django writer-director Sergio Corbucci returns with this off the wall violent and quirky comedic R-rated Western that revives an all star eccentric cast of Franco Nero, Tomas Milian, Jack Palance and Fernando Rey in a typically political spaghetti gun-fest. Ennio Morricone's score is on a whole other level as usual, and is too epic to be confined to this tale of mere mortal drunken bandidos and a cracker ass gringo. <br /><br />A melodramatic italo-story of political and personal loyalties during the Mexican revolution, counterbalanced with the comedic "odd ball" pairing of Yodlaf Peterson (Nero), a cool and clam Swedish arms dealer, and the emotional and impetuous El Vasco (Milian), a wild Mexican revolutionary. Long story short, the two need to go on a journey to find the only man who who knows how to open an impenetrable safe full of gold back down in Mexico, the Prof. Xantos (Rey); but it's not a pleasure tour, as he is being held captive in an American garrison, and all the while the two are being hunted by a 'marijuana-crazed' Jack Palance. <br /><br />The movie is full of ridiculously fun machine gun fights and and a large dose of good humored violence, and each characters personality is so exaggerated there is a clashing of egos in almost every scene in the film which makes for a memorable two hours. Recommended for anybody else like me who lives for these types of free-spirited dual- crossed-bandoleers stories where the fate of the sun drenched universe is decided by those with the biggest sombrero and tequila induced machismo. viva la muerte, pinche...
