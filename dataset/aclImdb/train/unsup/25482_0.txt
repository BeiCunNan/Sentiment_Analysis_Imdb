This would be an amazing film in the -50's But nowadays, this is one heck of a bad movie. Like , OK, there are Huge Human eating Ants, and the people in the movie just say, OK, that is a big ant, and they don't get upset as they or I should be if i was in a situation like that. Its like i see a tree that falls down, and i "ooooohhhh" a tree just fell down due to it was old and dead. Emotions in this film is blown away. and when the ""SWAT"" team arrives, a full 4-5 people command line arrives to the place where the ants are bugging people, they simply comes up with the idea to Blow the skyscrape up... Like if 4 people had that power to do so.. Don't go see this movie, unless you are 90+ years of age and haven't seen a film in 50 years.<br /><br />Cheers
