"The Prince and the Pauper" is based on Mark Twain's novel of the same name. The story is a hypothetical situation where Edward VI exchanges places with a beggar that resembles him as he is about to become King of England.<br /><br />The Mauch twins, Bobby and Billy, skillfully play the roles of Edward VI and the beggar Tom Canty. Errol Flynn is well-cast as the dashing hero Miles Hendon, who comes to protect Edward when he's taken for a beggar. Claude Rains was a perfect choice to play his oft-reprised role of a conniving man grasping for power which he plays so well. Also notable are Alan Hale as the captain of the guard, Barton MacLane as Tom Canty's despicable father and Montagu Love as the counseling Henry VIII.<br /><br />The story is not meant as history, but rather an examination of social disparities. Twain's social commentary is, as usual, mixed with his clever humor. The story moves along well with this mix as well as the machinations at court. The only part that seemed somewhat drawn out was the coronation ceremony.
