As stated by many, this movie missed the theme and plot of Hugo's Les Miserables. It left out so many important details that makes Les Miserables the story it is known for. The absence of the Thenardiers was a terrible mistake, they are crucial to understand the character of not only Cosette, but Jean Valjean, Marius, and Javert as well. Eponine and Gavroche are favorites in both the book and the stage production, and although you see "glimpses" of them in the film, they just don't hold the obliged significance. There were major character flaws such as Cosette's extreme naivity and innocence and Marius' incredible stubborness. He is not the leader of the ABC by any means, he was too stuck in his own mind to think.I could go on describing all the peevish things this movie holds, but I won't.
