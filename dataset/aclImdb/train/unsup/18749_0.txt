Since this movie has 3 mini-movies, I will give a short review and score of each in the order that I liked them.<br /><br />Box - 9 out of 10 - This was my favorite of the three films. I loved the look and feel of it. Absolutely beautiful. To be honest I was surprised that Miike could pull this off. All of his other films are off the wall gangster-esquire gore shockudramas. This one had a very deliberate pace and feel to it. I expected the least from this film due to the horror genre and having seen Gozu, which was great but far from terrifying, as my last Miike film. Its the tale of jealousy and a horrible mistake that can never be forgotten.<br /><br />Dumpling - 7 out of 10 - Id never heard of Fruit Chan before I saw this film and now I'm interested to see what else he has done and I'm excited to see what he'll do next. You have the story of an aging actress to who to preserve her youth my eating "special" dumplings which are said to reverse the aging process. To use a wondrous pun, she has bitten off way more than she can chew. Horrified at first...vampiric insatiability to follow. This is a very gritty, very dark horror piece that will definitely make you squirm.<br /><br />Cut - 6.5/10 - I expected the most from this one being that its by good ole Chan Park, and I was really excited when the film starts and we see a grand set with one of the spookiest looking characters I've seen in awhile. We then learn this isn't what it appears to be and so goes the actual story. Its a bout a director who has recently learned some things about himself and his wife and now his personality is split in two; one wants her dead and the other wants to remain faux-happy and continue with his life. This sets up a great battle in his mind, which is played out on screen for us as two characters...an unhappy "extra" from his films represents his evil side....and he himself, along with the help of a child bi-stander, plays the good/innocent part of his persona....or does he?? You decide. I expected a lot more from this one, which is probably why I'm hitting the hardest. Id just seen Sympathy For Lady Vengeance, and Oldboy always weighs heavily on my mind when reviewing psycho-horror dramas. It could've been a much tighter segment, and I would've preferred to watch the movie within the movie that was being made from the get go.<br /><br />Do see this trilogy though. All around its an excellent watch with an excellent feel to all 3 flicks.<br /><br />7 out of 10.
