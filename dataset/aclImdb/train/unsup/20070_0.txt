This has been taken from the novel "Map of the Universe". Some of the chapters are "Est" (the game show), "In and Out of Planet Earth" and "Writing on the Wall". Some footage of "The Complete Map of the Universe" has been taken from the first two seasons of the TV show: "Est" and some footage from the other two feature films.<br /><br />Although I have to admit that it makes for great entertainment, the treatment of the contestants surely contravene the Geneva convention. Forget about the prisoners in the War on Terror, 'Est' is completely insane. The contestants become patients and they have to be cured. It's a sort of a psycho warfare on the contestant's brain. It's totally insane.<br /><br />The Doctor responsible for this in the film is Dr Kelvin but he is invisible and is only heard once. This means that the film director Nick Peterson is responsible for their treatment. Most of the actors and members of the team who worked with him on other films have complained about how strict and demanding he is. He wants full commitment and he always get it.<br /><br />If the result is great then it doesn't matter what the method is.
