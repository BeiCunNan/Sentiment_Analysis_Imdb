This movie was bad. When I first found it, I thought maybe it was an "advanced" copy of the hell ride coming out soon, but I was very mistaken. I'm not sure when the name changed from the trip to hell ride, but I had to look up the director/writer to find this movie. Anyhow, The feel of this movie was like watching a college level production, with a little more money involved. <br /><br />The crazy driver honking his horn over and over as he chased the kids got on my nerves. The only thing good about this movie was.... ..... The brief breast flash of the ghost girl. THATS IT! If this movie was on HBO 3 or something and you have time to kill waiting for the paint to dry in your bedroom, then this is a great movie to sit down and watch!
