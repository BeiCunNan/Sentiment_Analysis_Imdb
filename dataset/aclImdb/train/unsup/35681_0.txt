It started on the road and probably shouldn't have gone farther. Psycho delivery driver gets fired due to poor driving. Stalks woman who reported him, and her family. I would tell you the ending but technically that would be a spoiler - though nothing could really spoil this cookie cutter predictable attempt. A very UN-thrilling thriller. May attract a few young males hoping to see Yasmine Bleethe in Baywatch attire - but, sorry guys - no bikini today.
