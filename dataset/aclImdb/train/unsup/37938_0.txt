Adaptation of John Patrick's play about American soldier trying to teach Democracy to the Japanese in 1946 Okinawa. One-joke material about cultural assimilation isn't exactly politically-correct when seen today, but were these stale, frantic jokes ever amusing? Marlon Brando's performance as an Oriental interpreter has to be seen to be believed; he's lively, yes, but there's a concerted effort to make him appear clownish (this couldn't have been Brando winging it--director Daniel Mann must assume part of the blame). This silly story never gains any momentum, and the slapstick hijinks are broad but stilted (they have a mechanical feel which, again, should be attributed to the direction). Glenn Ford, Paul Ford and Eddie Albert are solid as always, but they get swallowed up in this unfunny facade. *1/2 from ****
