Whether or not you like this movie will probably depend on whether you like seeing movies where the leading characters aren't particularly bright or likable. If you can get past this, you'll probably be a person who would rate this movie higher than a 2.<br /><br />Kristen seems like a normal and decent sort of person for the first 1/4 of the film. In fact, at times, she physically looks a lot like the director, Liv Ullmann. However, rather inexplicably, she is swept away by a rogue. WHY she loves him exactly is never clear--it just seems like a case of infatuation. BUT, here's where the dumb part of the film occurs. First, despite there being little to base such a strong attraction on, Kirsten sleeps with the man and pledges her life to him--even after she finds out he already has a mistress (who, left her own husband to be with him). Then, despite finding out more and more and more awful things about the guy (he's a real pig), she steadfastly refuses to back away from him---hurting her parents and her fianc√© in the process. Think about it--a woman sacrifices everything for a man she barely knows and what so does know about him is really bad stuff!! I hate films about dumb people.<br /><br />By the way, IF the film had been the same up until she met the jerk and then fell in love with a WORTHY man, then this could have been a wonderful film about a young lady choosing an arranged marriage or listening to her own needs. But, as she is just a horny idiot, this was an opportunity lost.
