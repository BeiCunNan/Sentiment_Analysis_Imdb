In my opinion it is a film without any grace. It is incredible to see the great and funny film "Amici Miei" has the same rating as this awful "Fantozzi". It's horrendous repetitive succession of sketches. It is a horrible movie and i don't understand what kind of people may like this movie. But what surprises me is that so few people have been suspended it.<br /><br />In Spain there are also similar films as the films of Paco Mart√≠nez Soria for example. It is very difficult to stand and watch the entire movie. There are moments when it seems incredible how bad it is. I write this review because I love the comedies of all sorts and I was completely disappointed with this film.<br /><br />All in all, a complete and total waste of time.
