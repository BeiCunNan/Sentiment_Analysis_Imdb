My title refers to how this viewer's intelligence felt after watching the show. What a yucky, lowest common denominator mess. The concept is pretty crappy to begin and it feels likes a rudderless, directionless ship from start to finish (I didn't actually get through the last commercial break because my trusty remote put its foot down).<br /><br />I like giving new shows a chance and especially comedy ones, but between this one and keys to the hiv, there just isn't much out there worth paying attention to. Hopefully this show will not get renewed so they can fit in another half hour of Daily Show. Heck, I would take Daily Shows from the late 90s over this unfunny prattle.<br /><br />Awful show.
