I just saw this film in a preview for the SF Film Society, and was deeply moved by it. It was masterful storytelling combining a deeply personal search for identity with a historical retelling of a national disgrace. As others have commented, I too was in North India till 1985 (Delhi & Kanpur) and even being so close, I was unaware of the extent of the atrocities and the deep complicity of the government till I saw this movie. This really is an unexplored chapter in Indian history in the media, compared to the many films about Hindu-Muslim riots such as Bombay, Mr & Ms Iyer, Hey Ram etc and kudos to Shonali Bose for exploring this issue. <br /><br />But it was also the small but exquisite touches that touched a chord in me. Others have complained that Khanna seems too wooden, but he reminds me of people I have known at college in Delhi (including perhaps myself), and a couple of scenes between him and Sen Sharma portray a deep intimacy without the unrealistic physical displays too often seen in other Indian movies. And the relationships between the family members seemed very real to me - the affection between mother and daughter and between mother and grandmother was touching and palpable. And yes, the pace seems slow at first, but the build up is terrific (although the music during the opening scenes could do with a little less of the dramatic bass undertones) and the scenes at the dhaba and in the jhuggis are first rate, as is the portrayal of Gobind by Yashpal Sharma. <br /><br />Overall, this film is a must-see for anyone interested in Indian cinema and in Indian history.
