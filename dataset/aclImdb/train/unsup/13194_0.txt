I thought this was a great movie, for fans of all ages. And I think Dakota Fanning is a sweet girl with an awesome acting future ahead of her. I think it was wonderful that they changed the role of the child from a boy to a girl just for her. She made this film, made it work and made you believe. It's a feel good film. It teaches patience and perseverance. It shows kids and adults alike what can come from hard work. I thought it was a very inspiring film. Made me remember what it was like to be a kid, when everything was possible. See this movie, you won't regret it...unless you have a heart of stone. It made me treasure the moments between a father and a daughter, having lost my dad this year. I miss him and I wish we'd had a bonding moment like the ones in the film. And it was good to see Kurt Russell again. He's always been a favorite of mine. And now I can add another movie to my list of all time faves.
