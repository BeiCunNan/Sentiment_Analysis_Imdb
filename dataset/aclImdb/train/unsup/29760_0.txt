"Emmanuelle" is an elegant, excellently photographed movie, but too often rolls in a syrupy pretension <br /><br />It is about a young, French woman who joins her husband in Bangkok There much of Emmanuelle's allure is that she isn't shy about her body, or even afraid to engage in sexual activity in semipublic places <br /><br />There are a number of rousing, lesbian meetings very typical of French cinema, coupled with encounters with handsome, sensitive men who enjoy superficial lovemaking The film really deals in sensual images and an over-blown, continuous repeating of its erotic philosophy There is sensual intimacy between Emmanuelle and the other women that is rare in the cinema<br /><br />My favorite moment when teen-ager Christine Boisson comes upon the nude Sylvia Kristel asleep Without embarrassment, she leans forward and unusually caresses gently and affectionately Emmanuelle's breast with her finger
