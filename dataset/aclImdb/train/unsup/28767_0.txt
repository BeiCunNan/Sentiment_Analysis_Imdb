This movie is a masterpiece of 1980's comedies. It has everything you want in an 80's film. Washed up actors like Scott Baio and Willie Aames (who are actually funny in the film) super hot Heather Thomas that can give a gay man a hard on, plenty of great 80's songs that you never heard of, a prom scene, a sports cliche, plenty of flopping breasts, and Scatman Crothers. This movie came out back when R rated films made money. The film was PG and then they added some boobies to make it rated R. Today, Solaris was given an R just for showing George Clooney's liberal behind (it was later revoked to PG-13). Back then, producers knew that kids wanted to see large, oval shaped tater tots and kids drinking and going bonkers. This movie would be great to show with such flawless films as Bachelor Party, Revenge of the Nerds, Porky's, and Three O'Clock High. Forget American Pie and Old School, watch the REAL films that started them all. WOW!
