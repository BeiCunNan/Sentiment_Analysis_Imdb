Man this is a lame scary movie, the dialogs and the sound is more like from a adult flick. The camera angels is like a bad hair day. Usually i like b-horrors but this one is not on this scale whatsoever. I think it feels like a home made horror to me and not something with a budget over $200. Sorry guys but i think this flick really sucks. The cutting is also a incoherent thing, they jump all over the place with not so much connections. The killing scenes is not to recommend to anyone who have seen b horrors, even troma is better to scare me than this flick. What can you get out of this movie? I think nothing because of several reasons. The mention of magic in this movie is not really what's it is about, at least that is what i read about the esoteric and magic. Many things in this movie is incoherent and badly cut, with weird camera positions and many things that you "need" to get a horror flick. Not the innovating kind.
