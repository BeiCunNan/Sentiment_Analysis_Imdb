This movie is by far the worst I have ever seen, and coming from a guy that enjoyed Starship Troopers (1!!) that says alot. This one just has it all, it's a complete waste of time. They should put warnings on crap movies like this, honestly. At some point the woman makes a scarab crawl up some dudes "skin" which is CLEARLY and unmistakebly some rubber overlay. This tells me that not only was the budget really low, but the crew were also in a hell of a hurry and nobody could be arsed to tell the director he was really really bad. The make-up artists should be cursed for all eternity and beaten with various sticks. This is me, telling you, not to see this movie, unless you want to have something to talk about.
