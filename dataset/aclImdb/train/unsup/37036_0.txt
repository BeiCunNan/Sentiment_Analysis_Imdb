Are you kidding me? How did this get so many good ratings? When Tom Arnold is the best actor in your movie you know you have a problem. The acting was poor the outcome was obvious. Don't bother wasting time on this one. Lots of crude kid humor that was not necessary or funny and musical montages that had repeated scenes and could have been left out for a much shorter movie.<br /><br />Sorry but the twins could not have been more annoying. Was there some reason this mother never knew where her kids were and didn't seem to care?
