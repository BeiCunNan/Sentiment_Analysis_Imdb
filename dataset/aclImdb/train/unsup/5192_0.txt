I tried my best to keep an open mind! "Miracles" borders on camp. Story lines make no sense. The boy ghost says the evil spirit "wants everything." Really now? That's a truly exciting revelation! Especially when in an earlier episode, at his funeral, the same boy ghost shows up all happy, and at peace. We are led to believe there's closure. Can't the writers make-up their minds? Or, are they trying to save money by not hiring more actors!<br /><br />One episode even turned an old lady into jelly! She caves in and tells her deep, dark secret because one of our dopey investigators had the audacity to ask twice. Wow! That would convince me to spill the beans to a bunch of strangers after keeping my mouth shut for well over 50 years! <br /><br />The acting is not inspiring, either. There's no chemistry. At times I get the feeling the main characters don't know if they are going to be filming the next episode. Sometimes it seems like the actors are trying hard not to giggle. Keep in mind this not supposed to a comedy show! <br /><br />This series is a cross between X-files and Bewitched. A confusing mess to say the least! Good try, no cigar!
