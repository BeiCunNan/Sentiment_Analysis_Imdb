I am only giving this movie a one out of ten because it actually finished before I ended up a drooling mess in the corner of the room .We found this 'comedy' on TV and thought we would give it a chance cos it had Dana Carvey in it and it might have been entertaining , how wrong we were . This movie was'nt funny , just inane , at one point a character has a disguise like grass with a cow poo for a face . The jokes and situations were weak and when it finished we were saying " what the hell was that all about " Sorry to say we found this a big waste of time , but my workmate told me her boyfriend really likes this movie , so I guess you should watch it and judge for yourselves .
