I found Explorers to be a rather interesting film.All sci-fi's I have seen have many things in common,They all go to space,see aliens... but I can't think of any that do -other than Explorers,(fill me in if I'm wrong)explain HOW a spaceship is made? The force field idea-wow. The movie has a certain feeling about it,it is hard to explain, but the only way I can explain it is that when you watch it,you want to be apart of the movie and be,well,an explorer. The soundtrack is great also,the music flows so well,it kinda reminds me of Star Wars episode 1 &2 theme songs.Its cool-it rocks.What can I say,It's my favorite movie of all time without a doubt.I want to add also,that this movie deserves more credit,it really was a brilliant movie-it deserved a sequel(...Just think,Imagine what adventures Ben,Darren,Wolfgang and Amanda would be having with their technology?). Explorers certainly deserves to be put onto DVD format.<br /><br />10/10
