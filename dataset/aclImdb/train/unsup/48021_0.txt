I got this print from Video Search of Miami, not really knowing for sure what I was in for. I was under the impression that this was a possession movie, and it is, sort of. Unfortunately, all of the characters are so boring that after a while you stop caring who's doing what to whom. The basic plotline is this: young girl becomes possessed by the spirit of her dead mother while left in the care of her tyrannical father. There are a number of other people living in the house, but it isn't really explained what they're doing there. In fact, there isn't much in the way of a plot either. There a few really sleazy moments which I won't give away for you exploitation fans. Ultimately, this one is for diehard fans of the genre only.
