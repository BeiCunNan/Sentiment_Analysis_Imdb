I rented this movie tonight and after twenty minutes, my wife began washing dishes. Fifty minutes in and I was playing games on my cell. This movie has nothing to do with Stanley Kubrick so if you're intrigued because you are a Kubrick fan, don't waste your time. Looking at Brian Cook's resume, it seems like he was Kubrick's long time assistant director. Obviously he wasn't paying attention. Some of the compositions look very ameteurish, straight out of film school (characters placed in the middle of the frame, staring directly at the camera). Worst of all, the film gave no insight into Alan Conway and why he was doing the things he was doing. The dialogue is painfully self-conscious. Everybody in this film is completely aware there are in a film. Nobody acts like a real person. Even John Malkovich's performance (which others are praising) is very over the top, with an ounce of subtlety. Stay away...
