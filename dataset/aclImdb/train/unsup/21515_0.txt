Caveat: I have always hated Martin Short. I find him annoying, semi-retarded, and blame him for the Phoebe-Cates-career-killing "Drop Dead Fred", even if he was not even in that film. However, Short was quite amusing in this one.<br /><br />"Innerspace" has Dennis Quaid shrunk down to be injected into a rabbit. Whoops! He's stolen by the villain from "UHF" and injected into Martin Short instead, who then must save Quaid with the help of Quaid's girlfriend, the pseudo-lesbian Meg Ryan.<br /><br />Short's quirkiness worked for this film. I mean, goodness, he has a little man inside of him. And he works well with director Joe Dante, a Steven Spielberg protégé influenced by Bugs Bunny... his comedy is best reflected in "Gremlins" and "Gremlins 2". How he got to be a master of horror is beyond me (though one would assume from "The Howling").<br /><br />The shots inside the body were interesting (like the "Body Wars" ride at Disney World), and Quaid was a great pilot for the adventure. I could have used less Meg Ryan, who seemed to be very unnecessary to the plot and her allegiance was unclear.<br /><br />So um, yeah... it was a fun romp... watch it.
