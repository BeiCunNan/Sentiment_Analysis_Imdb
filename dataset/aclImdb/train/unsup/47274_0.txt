Sean Connery plays an old but avid master-thief and Catherine Zeta-Jones a not to be trusted insurance-agent. They team up to the biggest jackpot of all time: 8 billion dollars.<br /><br />This is the worst movie I've seen in 5 years, probably since 'The Avengers'. Why this piece-of-junk-script was ever sold and developed into a big-budget-movie like this is far beyond me. There are so many plotholes and ridiculous facets in this monster, I can't even begin to describe.<br /><br />**SPOILERS** Ok, I'll try for the ones that linger most: Zeta-Jones doing those ridiculous ballet-moves to dodge laserbeams; she can dodge in in 2:30mins but dodge out in 30 secs; in the end they give back the 8 billion dollars minus 1 billion; like they didn't notice!<br /><br />Furthermore, the directing is horrible. The main characters are dramatically swinging from left to right and Sean Connery actually gives a bad performance, which is something to achieve. I wasn't impressed by Zeta-Jones yet and this movie didn't improve it.<br /><br />I'm trying very hard not to take it personal that these kind of movies get made, because they're a downright insult to the public and solely made for the purpose of making money and making it big. It disgusts me.
