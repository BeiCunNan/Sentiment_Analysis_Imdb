When I first tried to watch this film, I was around ten or eleven and though it was lame, boring and disturbing. Nowadays I'm a huge fan of Cronenberg and think that this is a quality film. It's not without its issues, the characters mostly aren't terribly interesting and neither are the actors, and the writing and direction are efficient and sometimes ace, but not as overall gripping as Cronenberg's later works. However, the plot is genius, a kind of twisted allegorical look at sexual revolution and the bourgeoisie, and the crude but effective special effects make for many effective shock scenes. Of the acting, Barbara Steele stands out the most, though her role isn't too big, she is as majestic a horror queen as she was when she began and the role makes best use of her. The main lady with infected husband is pretty decent too, although her role is kinda thin. The film is watchable throughout though it does feel often like somewhat of a b movie. The ending is fantastic though, showcasing Cronenbergs subversive wizardry. Altogether, this is an influential, highly entertaining grisly sci fi horror classic, just a whisker away from the directors superlative later work.
