I can't believe some posters are waxing nostalgic about this movie.<br /><br />It stinks.<br /><br />When Neil Simon is funny, he's pretty funny.<br /><br />When he's off, it's excruciating to watch, and man is he off on this. I saw it when it first came out, and it seemed hopelessly dated then. I can only imagine what a relic it is now.<br /><br />Yes, Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn were good in FOUL PLAY, but that had a great script going for it. This absolutely, positively does not.<br /><br />The jokes fall flat, the scenarios are strained beyond belief, and it just comes across as a bit of Hollywood hopelessly detached from reality.<br /><br />In fact, it might just be worse than MODERN PROBLEMS or UNDER THE RAINBOW. <br /><br />Watch this at your own peril, unless you want to see Exhibit #A in Chevy Chase's unprecedented run at picking awful scripts.
