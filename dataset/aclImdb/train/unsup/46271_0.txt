There's a mystery at the heart of this abberation...why on earth did somebody of Johnny Depp's talent chose to cameo in this debacle? Unsympathetic characters, dodgy editing, bland caricatures and a plot line you'd have trouble filling a matchbook with. Our 'hero', Tennant is about as interesting to watch as a lobotomy on a gnat. To say he's uninspiring is a gross injustice to flat performers the world over. So here it is: Bradford undertaker decides to follow LA chick back to her homeland...and?...motivation?...development? That would be asking too much. Question: Vincent Gallo, Julie Delpy, what on earth were you thinking of? This insipid piece of self indulgent flatulence should have been strangled in the editing room, I say editing room loosely. It feels like the producers shipped the editing duties out to a first term film student...there are plenty of bad films out there, thankfully this one has been hidden in amongst the other dross on cable pay TV. The likes of Gallo, Delpy and Depp must cringe whenever this one is half remembered.
