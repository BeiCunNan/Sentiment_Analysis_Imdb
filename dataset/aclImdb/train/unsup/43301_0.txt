This is without a doubt the worst adaptation ever. Im sorry but british comedy is only funny when its *British*. The American humour aint at all funny and the characters are weak to say the least. The only good point about this show is Kryten......only because its the original. An absolutely terrible tv show, if you like Red Dwarf then watch the original.<br /><br />
