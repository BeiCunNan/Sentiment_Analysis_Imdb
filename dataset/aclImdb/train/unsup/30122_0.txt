hey this is pretty good. i was sort of afraid that i wouldnt like it. i was surprised. not because Orson Welles directed, and co-starred. he's my favorite director, and actor. it's just that, well, since it was made for French television i had my doubts. but it was a good movie and i enjoyed it and the shots were very cool and it had a sort of hypnotic power in its lazy simplicity. Orson Welles was truly the greatest director of all time. he was the first director to make the camera move like a ghost, and act like a ghost. the camera acts as a character in itself, but of course, it isnt there. some directors "over direct" by imitating Welle's style; one can over direct the same way one overacts. this movie reminded me of a Bergman piece. it moved slowly, thoughtfully, coolly. it's a cool movie to mellow out to.
