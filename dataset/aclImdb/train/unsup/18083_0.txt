Harry and Lloyd are not your standard comedy duo. After all these years I still can't tell who's the brains of this pathetic operation: Harry or Lloyd. Jeff Daniels has never portrayed an oaf as likable as Harry Dunne before--all his character's were quite respectable and normal prior to Dumb & Dumber. Carrey's been crazy--Ace Ventura, the Mask--but never stupid.<br /><br />This is the story about two dead-beat buddies that cannot maintain a steady job. Lloyd falls in love with a young lady named Mary after driving her to the airport. She leaves her briefcase inside the airport --deliberately to pay a ransom-- and Lloyd snags it. The rest of the movie is a road trip from Providence to Aspen to return it to its rightful owner.<br /><br />This is Bobby and Peter Farrelly's directorial debut; they do a wonderful job. Years later they teamed up with Carrey again to film "Me Myself and Irene," which was a great movie, but even though the movie was nastier, even though it contained a chicken up a filthy pig's ass, it still couldn't match the wonderful grossness Peter, Bobby, Jim & Jeff provided in one of the funniest films in cinema history. 4 stars.
