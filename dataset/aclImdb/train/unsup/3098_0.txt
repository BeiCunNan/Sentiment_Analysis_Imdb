i saw this when i was about 5 and i was convinced that gizmo was real. it wasn't untill i was about 10 that i realised he wasn't (that was a very sad day. the effects for the gremlins and gizmo are amazing. this film seems to be on every christmas here so when i watch it it always brings back good memories. its and underrated classic.<br /><br />8/10
