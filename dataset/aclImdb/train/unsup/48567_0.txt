Ho Ho Ho, what a load of crap this film turns out to be. Watching this with my family I came up with the line "I'm looking for Joey Nova" as a running joke throughout the movie. Say it with that deep Italian, New York accent and you'll understand the attraction as a central theme in the film.<br /><br />Rob De Niro plays a aging cop looking for Joey Nova (James Franco), a young junkie with an terribly predictable connection to the cop. The moment De Niro reveals the connection, I felt so sad that he was asked to utter such a pathetic script. Watch De Niro's expression closely when he has to say the unutterably bad line.<br /><br />My family, including my brother who is a massive fan of De Niro (and why not when the guy has a string of truly awesome and unrepeatable characterisations from his early career) came to the conclusion that in America, you can always buy talent, but you can't make them (only make them fake them) drink from the putrid stream served up by Hollywood as "cinema".<br /><br />Only for those who like to bang their head against a wall.<br /><br />I'd give it 0 out of 5.<br /><br />
