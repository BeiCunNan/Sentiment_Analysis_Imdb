Such a little film and it raises so many questions. I saw this film at a Sardi's Chowder Society lunch years ago, and I was astounded. We never see the driver, we never see the car, we just see the view forward from the front bumper, and what a view it is. FLAT-OUT through the early morning streets of Paris in something very, very fast. Seemingly insane risks are taken as red lights are blown thru at 120+ mph, pedestrians and on-coming traffic narrowly missed. How was this possible? Was there any traffic control or did the driver really take those risks? Who drove? Who is the woman at the end? What made her worthy of such a drive? But most importantly, exactly what kind of car was it? (I'd like to think it's a Ferrari 275 or 365, some knowledgeable buffs say a Renault Alpine, but no one can answer that one for sure.) If you are a sports car enthusiast, this film is not optional, it's mandatory. For others, some get it, and some don't.
