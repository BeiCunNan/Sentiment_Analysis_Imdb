This film starts off with a mother and daughter traveling together and both of them are not getting along because of her mother getting a divorce and the daughter feels sorry for her dad.<br /><br />As this couple travel, the daughter is kidnapped by a very strange group of young people and the mother soon finds out that it is a group of people who are well organized in dark mysteries and spiritual powers that can transform people into all kinds of creatures that love to enjoy drinking blood and all sorts of sick dark acts of lust.<br /><br />This is not your average horror film, but it is worthwhile viewing even if it does not make any sense.
