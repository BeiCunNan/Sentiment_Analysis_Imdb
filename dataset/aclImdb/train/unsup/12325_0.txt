The first of the Elm Street sequels is a bit different than the other films of the series, but it's not nearly as bad as some critics say.<br /><br />Young man (whose family has moved into the Elm Street house) is terrorized by chuckling Freddy, who wants to use him to do his dirty work.<br /><br />'Elm Street 2 is a fairly entertaining sequel directed by B movie maker Jack Sholder. The movie's possession theme is solidly played out with some tight direction. Sholder gives this movie some well-done moments of shock and dark humor. The opening sequence on the bus is a memorable thrill ride. The film boasts some bloody FX. Charles Bernstein's theme music is missed, but Bing Crosby's song 'Did You Ever See A Dream' makes for a nice touch. Many say that this movie has homosexual themes and granted star Mark Patton does spend much of the movie semi-naked, but the theme is a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />Robert Englund makes a welcomed return as Freddy, while the rest of the cast does decent performances.<br /><br />All around, a good sequel that hasn't really gotten critical justice.<br /><br />Followed by the superior Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987).<br /><br />*** out of ****
