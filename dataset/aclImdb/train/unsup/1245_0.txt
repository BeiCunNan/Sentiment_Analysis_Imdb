"Patti" is a strange and gutsy little flick with dialogue that sounds improvised, but in a good way - this is how real people talk. Give credit to the actors for getting naked, too...appropriate in a film about stripping down barriers and getting to the core behind the ugly things we say.<br /><br />Besides, it's kinda fun, and short enough to hold your attention. Nice one when your date bails on you.
