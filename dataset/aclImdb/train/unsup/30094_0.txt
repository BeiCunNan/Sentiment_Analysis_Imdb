I've seen the first four seasons and I must say it's one of the finest TV series I've ever seen. If you like thrilling action on the screen, you _must_ see this. Jack Bauer is a great character, but I was also very impressed by President Palmer, whose wisdom, calm and dedication to his country shall stay as an example for each people on this world who plays a leadership role. Besides that, the team spirit in the CTU, despite the high pressure and extreme situations they're facing is absolutely fantastic. I hope there will be a season 6, 7 and so on and I'm looking forward to watch them. Actors, crew, producers, a big THANK YOU for making this happen!
