I give this film a one out of ten stars, simply because this movie has earned just one. It goes down as something so horrible that it blurs the lines between garbage and masterpiece. If you are in the mood for a good laugh and some horribly good acting then look no further. The plot doesn't matter, it in fact just shows clips from the first movie through the middle of the movie, but when you meet the title character Ricky face to face you realize that the movie is taking a turn for the best/worst. Ricky is a character who you will learn to love, His acting can be summed up with the best line of the movie. "GARBAGE DAY?!??!?!!!"
