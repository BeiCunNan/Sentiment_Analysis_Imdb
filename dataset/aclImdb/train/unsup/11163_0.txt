Great coming-of-age movie. Has alot of heart and touches on real Americana - apropos for our times. Wonderful mix of love story and love of baseball.<br /><br />I was routing for them all the way! Hopefully this director-writer team will get a chance to do something again with a bigger budget and more well known talent, but very enjoyable none the less.
