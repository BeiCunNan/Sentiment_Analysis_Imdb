There's a killer on the loose in Florida. He starts calling reporter Malcolm Anderson (Kurt Russell) to talk and help spread his story. This is the break Anderson has been looking for all his life. He starts printing stories of his talk with the killer which become front-page news. But as the killings continue and Anderson gets more obsessed, a serious question comes up--is Anderson's reporting fueling on the killings? His girlfriend (Mariel Hemingway) becomes very frightened and the killer starts getting angry...<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!The movie starts off well posing some very serious and thought-provoking questions...and then falls apart. At the end all the questions are forgotten and it ends up with a big fistfight between Anderson and the killer. SPOILERS END!!!!!!<br /><br />The movie does have other problems--there are WAY too many false scares (I counted about 12) and there's a needless shower scene which is just in there to show off Hemingway's chest. Also Richard Mansur and Andy Garcia (in small roles) are terrible and then-unknown Joe Pantoliano is given nothing to do. <br /><br />However Russell is great and Richard Jordan is superb as the killer. Hemingway is saddled with just being a whining girlfriend at the beginning--and then she becomes a helpless victim. I HATED the sequence at the end where all she does is scream and cry--her character was originally much stronger than that. The script (for most of the movie) is good and it was shot on location in Florida with a nicely done sequence in the Everglades. And there's a great sequence in which Russell races to save Hemingway.<br /><br />So...it's worth seeing. Just don't expect much from the end.
