First the movie is bad, not horrible just really bad. The only thing that kept me watching was the girl(Erna Sch√ºrer)she looks like the long lost twin of Tara Reid. Erna is somehow softer looking, but a close copy. It turns out Erna Schurer is some late 60 early 70 Italian scream queen. She did all those sadistic/exploitation/well endowed nude horror movies that are becoming so popular lately(Italian grind house). If you have a 100min or so to kill, and want to watch a low budget Italian/Spanish anti-war(Vietnam)movie that is poorly written not very well acted, somewhat funny(although it was not filmed for any laughs), and has a better version of Tara Reid then Tara Reid herself in it...then this movie is for you...Andrew Wolf(II)
