As I look through the pages of comments, I see a fairly common recurrence. People either love this movie, or they hate it. I've watched this movie upwards of 10 times and it has not ceased to be hilarious. Me and other friends who have watched the film even get laughs out of references to this film, because its so classic. Let me warn you that if you try to take this movie seriously, critique its script or plot, you will most likely fall into the category that hates this film. The true comedy comes from the absurd nature of the dialogue and the overacting which makes it that much funnier. Hopefully you will enjoy it.
