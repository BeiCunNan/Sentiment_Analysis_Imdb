This is another one of those "intelligent art films" you need to read the review first before you can understand the movie. If it wasn't for the great music and in general wonderful atmosphere created by the director at the Hey-Hey club, this movie would have been a total flop. The storyline is simply ridiculous, it has no meaning, no reason to be. The secondary story even less, we fail to even understand why it is there. The acting is superficial, in some cases exaggerated to the point of being silly (Jason-Leigh). The only remotely positive acting performance (surprisingly) was Belafonte in a not-so-bad copy of Brando's Godfather. The dialog was simply stupid, the only decent characterization was that of Belafonte's seldom Seen which emanated some real emotions, everything else seemed to be on the level of a five-year old. Thank god for the music...!
