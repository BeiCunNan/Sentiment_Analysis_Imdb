I wrote an entire 4 paragraph review of this "film," only to delete it upon realizing that I could talk forever about how absolutely crappy this thing is. I know that this film had no budget, but there is NO excuse for this thing. You don't need money to tell you to use more then 3 shots in an entire 20 minute scene, you don't need money to tell you that the wind is blowing in your boom mic, you don't need money to tell you that your actors are COMPLETELY half-assing the roles.<br /><br />You don't need money to tell you how to make a film.<br /><br />If you read this and still want to see this "film," I encourage you to go on youtube and watch just 5 minutes of the thing, you'll see what I mean.
