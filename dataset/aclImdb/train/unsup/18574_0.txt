I just recently rented this title and it was great.<br /><br />The story line contained issues from alcoholism, marriage issues to the normal every day issues in the life of our great firefighters and the crazy things we do with our friends.<br /><br />I know we've all done a few of those here and there.<br /><br />DJ Perry was awesome even considering this was his 1st starring role. A few times he was running in this movie I was waiting for him to fall flat on his face. He definitely kept it real. I would of been running my butt off if I was being chased by that hideous creature.<br /><br />All I can say is great writing, directing and acting.<br /><br />Go out and watch it!
