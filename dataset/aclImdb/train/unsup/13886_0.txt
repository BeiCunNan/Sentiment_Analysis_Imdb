Even if you don't already know the outcome of this, you are bound to get fired up! And you should. It is more relevant than ever today, with Congress trying to pass a Constitutional Amendment, not only stating that some relationships are more valid than others, but making it so that no one can even be allowed to think otherwise! Maybe it's just the script, but this movie makes it look as of the mother is not so much against her daughter's relationship, as she is using the state courts' bigotry to get back at her daughter for not letting her be as much a part of raising the child as she'd like. As bad as it seems, the real case is worse. But this is a great movie to watch if you need a reminder of why we have separation of church and state, and why we're in danger of losing it.
