Not an outstanding night, but i was very surprised at how the matches boiled out and the rumble winner left me thinking i was still sleeping. So once again wwe relies on shock value for the second pay per view running in order to be a success.<br /><br />1. Cruiserweight Open. 8/10 Bar the Rumble this match was the best of the night, it was so good, great moves, great finishers and some high flying as well, top match and great way to start off the pay per view.<br /><br />2. Boogeyman Vs JBL. 4/10 Wasn't really a "match" well what did you expect. It was more of a creepy segment with punch and kicks.<br /><br />3. Ashley Vs Mickie James. REF - Trish 3/10 It started well for these two, Ashley looked better in ring but after 5 minutes it turned into a horror show, they got sloppy, Trish got bored, Ashley started getting booed because all she was doing was fake, and i mean FAKE! punching and kicking, it was that bad. Ashley needs work and fast! <br /><br />4. Royal Rumble. 9/10 Quite a surprise to see this match 3rd on the card but at then end of the show it became clear why. It was a great rumble match as usual, a bit better then last year, mostly because i was so shocked Mysterio won, even though there were rumours he would, i didn't believe it, then when he was left with Orton i was sure Orton would win, but it was Rey!<br /><br />5. John Cena Vs Edge WWE CHAMPIONSHIP. 6/10 Once again i was quite at surprise with the result, even though there were rumours Cena would win it back so soon, i just couldn't see it happening. The match was okay, considering they haven't worked together much it was okay but nothing special or to write home about. Great entrance from Cena and big pop for his victory.<br /><br />6. Mark Henry Vs Kurt Angle WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP. 5/10 Well it was Mark Henry and not even the great Angle could get a match out of him, plus this match was so predictable that i couldn't even be bothered to concentrate, saying that there was nothing special to concentrate on. The end of the match made it all too clear why the booking of the PPV was in such bizarre order, yes the once again boring lacklustre return of the Undertaker, i am getting so sick of this guy.<br /><br />Overall a good night for shock value, plus the super cruiser weight match, the ending was very annoying, but not for Undertaker fans.
