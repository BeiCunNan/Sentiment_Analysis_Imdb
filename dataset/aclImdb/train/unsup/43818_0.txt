The first time I saw this movie I thought it was great. A little background. I grew up in a household that viewed TV as sinful. This was the first movie I ever saw. I loved it. Recently I was in the mood for some nostalgia so I rented First Knight. I cannot say enough bad things about this film. Here are the things I disliked about it in no particular order. 1. Not faithful to the Arthur legend. 2. Their idea of sword-fighting is two people standing still and swatting each others swords. Pathetic. 3. Way too much blue. Everything is blue. If the Smurfs told the story of King Arthur there would be less blue used. 4. Richard Gere? In a period piece? With an American accent? Really? 5. For living outside and fighting all the time Richard Gere certainly is clean. 6. The tactic that the attackers use to draw the defenders away from the coach is literally the oldest one in the book. However the commander is not reprimanded. Anyone who fell for that should have been immediately demoted back down to his level of competence. 7. Period incorrect armor and weapons. 8. Mindless drivel that passes for dialogue. 9. Julia Ormond is a pathetic actress. 10. The directors seemed determined to undermine all suspension of disbelief. At every moment of the movie they remind you not just that it is a movie but also that it is a bad movie.
