This is a very, very, very low-budget exploitation film made by a "poverty row" studio in the 1930s. It's all about the horrors of syphilis and appears to be well-meaning but is also VERY heavy-handed and silly. The actors are clearly not professionals as they say their lines like they are reading them directly from cue cards--sometimes only reading them syllable by syllable! <br /><br />The story involves a small-town girl from wins a beauty pageant and goes to New York to become a star but ends up taking a trip on the "casting couch". She gets VD and can't marry her fianc√©, that is until she's taken the cure. Unfortunately, she sees a quack who promises miracles and she is not only uncured but transmits this evil disease to her husband and eventually to their baby! The husband is left blind and the baby is clinging to life--all because of the dreaded syphilis! In addition to the overly melodramatic and silly story, the movie also passes along a lot of information to the audience--some of which is wrong (I taught sex ed and could tell). These portions of the films were very dry and preachy at best. Most likely it just helped to put the audience to sleep.<br /><br />Overall, instead of being a movie to frankly talk about STDs, it was cheap and in many ways exploitational. Because of its rotten production values, this film was the inspiration for the take off of sexploitation films done at the end of AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON (starring Carrie Fisher and Paul Bartell). While in every sense it is a terrible film, it could provide a lot of laughs if you see it with friends.
