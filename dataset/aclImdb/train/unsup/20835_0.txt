I saw this film at a special screening at a RPG convention in Dublin, Ireland called Gaelcon. I couldn't get into the first screening on the Saturday evening as numbers were restricted and the show was full. Fortunately for me they showed it again on the Sunday evening due to the demand.<br /><br />It is a Scottish independent full-length comedy film about a misfit group of gamers and their geek lust for crazy Goth chick that believes she is an elf. On the face of it seems just a simple farce with clich√©d characters but it does then start exploring the characters more deeply in the later part of the film. We learn that everyone has more to them than the 'masks' of the characters they portray in the in-movie game. The Celtic nature of the film adds to its magic, the Glaswegian landscape is just beautiful and the cast is very talented. <br /><br />It stars Edward Tudor-Pole and Eileen McCallum and introduces new talent Ross Finbow, James Young and Danielle Stewart as the ill- fated, star-crossed lovers. It is a funny movie and most role-players will see someone that they recognise (maybe themselves?) in the characters portrayed.<br /><br />It was a very good film, the audience at Gaelcon loved it as far as I could tell, with lots of laughter and some knowing nods now and again. Though they maybe the target audience for this film non-gamers will find it enchanting as well.
