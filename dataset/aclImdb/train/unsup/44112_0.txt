The original is a classic and one of my 50 favourite movies.<br /><br />This 2008 remake... I just watched it tonight... it was up there with being a BAD movie... It is very disappointing... come on... its 2008.... SURELY they could have remade it better than the 1970 (ish) version ? The answer: NO<br /><br />Its far fetched... has bad acting... bad special effects (the wave of virus washing across the land) and worse plot.<br /><br />Its rubbish compared to the original, which gave you a little tingle down your spine as you watched it... this version makes you feel embarrassed to admit you watched it.<br /><br />What made the original work is that it was 'confined'... the majority of the movie took place down in that closed off lab... you were trapped in there with the 'Andromeda strain' and the scientists. THATS what gave it its realism... All of the attempt at action... just shook the original plot all to pieces. <br /><br />Thumbs down on many levels...
