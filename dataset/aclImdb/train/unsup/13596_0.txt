I grew up watching "Charlie's Angels" on ABC when it was a primetime series! I watched it until the very last episode! Many people may say this show was silly but it is pure fun! I loved this show as a kid and now am taping all the episodes on TVLAND! Of coarse the best cast of angels was the original(Kate, Farrah and Jaclyn) but Cheryl Ladd was an excellent replacement for Farrah and in some ways, I consider Cheryl an "original" Angel, as she fit-in perfectly and stayed with the series until it's cancellation, along with Jaclyn Smith. I think the series went downhill when Kate Jackson left. It just wasn't the same. Kate added a great character and is a great actress and was kind of the "leader" of the bunch! WHen Shelly Hack replaced her, it was a bad choice! Shelly Hack is a horrible actress. When Tanya Roberts replaced Ms. Hack, the series picked-up again! Tanya should have been the original replacement for Kate. But by the time Tanya came on, the ratings had dropped because of Shelly Hack and it was over! Too bad as the storylines got better in it's final season and Tanya was great! One thing: WHY didn't they update the cars? I mean, THAT RED PINTO! UUUG!
