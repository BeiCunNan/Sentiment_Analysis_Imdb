For a while now, I've been trying to find Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Korei (aka. Seance). Admittedly, I'm not familiar with Kiyoshi Kurosawa's work, except for what i had seen in some asian film magazines and I was hooked already. But I truly was not prepared for KAIRO.<br /><br />This film is just plain terrifying. I really, really want to explain what this film is about but it'll only ruin the film, in my opinion. Plus, there is still somethings that I don't understand, but loved anyway.<br /><br />If I had to sum up this film, I'd probably have to say that it's a story about the end of the world from the most unlikely place. From within. Anymore info would just be cruel to give up.<br /><br />Though I've been vague about what goes on in the film I will say this. The atmosphere makes this movie everything that it is. In modern times many filmmakers go for the character's coming out loud and clear, and the atmosphere/environment is relegated to 2nd or even 3rd place. But here the true "star" of the film is the creepy and almost unbearably docile environment surrounding, enchanting, and swallowing up the main characters. There's a thin line between good Japanese horror (Ring) and bad Japanese horror (Inugami), this flick is so far from bad that it's practically holding hands with Ring as they stroll into my dvd collection.<br /><br />
