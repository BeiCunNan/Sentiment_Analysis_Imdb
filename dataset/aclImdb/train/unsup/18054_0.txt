Fleischer's snappy SUPERMAN franchise is as good as I expected it to bethat is, charming and brisk, exciting, thrilling and one of the most delightful cartoons availablein the form of these mindblowing greatlooking short installments.<br /><br />THE MECHANICAL MONSTERS' villain is a scientist who invented a bunch of huge flying robots, used to rob treasures and stuff.<br /><br />I love their discreet but firm way of glamorizing Lois Laneshe's not your everyday average girl next door .<br /><br />Because of shortness, the pace is, as advisable, awesome. The action requires the decided intervention of Superman.
