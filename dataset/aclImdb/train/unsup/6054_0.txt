SCARY MOVIE 4 does live up to the SCARY MOVIE premise-That being able to offer up stupid humor (and it does get stupid) and make us laugh at that incredibly stupid stuff. That said, this one (for me) falls a tad below part 3, which I thought (and still do) is the best in the bunch. I will say that part 4 does offer up some funny stuff. The funniest scene to me is when Cindy and Brenda arrive at 'The Village'. They are hiding in the bushes and see 2 village girls about ready to walk right by them. They decide that they need to pull these girls into the bushes and beat them for their clothes so Cindy and Brenda don't look out of place. They do this, the bushes move around for a bit and, finally, 2 girls emerge from the bushes. But it's not Cindy and Brenda. It's the 2 village girls. When Cindy and Brenda do emerge into view, they are disheveled and a little tired out. Funny stuff. Though some jokes misfire, this is still better than part 2.
