I recently saw this film at the Queer Documentary Film Festival in Portland, Oregon. It was one of the highlights of the festival. It is an excellent documentary which captures all the political, social, and very emotional issues surrounding gay/lesbian marriage. It can also be used very effectively as an educational tool when trying to educate straight audiences about this issue and why it has become so important to the gay and lesbian community on all these levels. Even very supportive straight friends do not really understand the depth of this issue. The film is long enough to be very substantive in content but short enough to grab your attention. It really is like a twist and turn mystery. Thank you directors and participants for this wonderful film.
