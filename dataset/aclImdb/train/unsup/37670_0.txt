Corporate raiders use any trick conceivable to lure a genius into their fold...oh, and to win.<br /><br />This was a rambling and unfocused tale with some mildly interesting plot elements, which suffer completely convoluted execution. Other than some nice camera angles and lighting details, there is nothing at all to redeem this work.<br /><br />Not even Christopher Walken's wonderful performance could save this flop. Willem Dafoe comes close, but no cigar. I suppose it may be worth watching for their performances, but you surely have to be a connoisseur to derive a moment's pleasure, even from that. OH, they're good, don't get me wrong, but the screenplay is horrid. Simply horrid.<br /><br />All in all? Don't bother.<br /><br />It rates a 0.7/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
