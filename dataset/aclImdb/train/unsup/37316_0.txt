While it is not a complete ripoff of the Hollywood blockbuster from Farrelly brothers (There is Something about Mary), it is largely based on it. The whole Ompuri/Magic formula angle does not work and is totally unnecessary. However the biggest annoyance is Vivek Oberoi popping in and out at the narrator (played by the Farrelly brothers themselves in the original). Similar material would have been gold in Priyadarshan's hand. Akshay and Paresh Rawal are the only performers of any notice in the movie, rest of the cast is poor to average in terms of performance. Shahid Kapur was particularly disappointing playing the role Ben Stiller played in the original, no laughs for him at all!! Anu Malik is no longer the music director he once was a decade or so ago, he has not delivered a knockout soundtrack in ages. Overall it might be best to re-watch the original; a definite miss for everyone who is not a hard-core Akshay Kumar/Paresh Rawal comedy fan.
