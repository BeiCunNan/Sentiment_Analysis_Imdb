I absolutely love this show. I stumbled upon in during the 3rd season premiere, and have been hooked ever since. It's such an intriguing chess-like game, and I'm always trying to guess what the players are going to do next... or rather, what I would do next were I in their place! I think, of all the reality shows, that this would be the one that's the most interesting to be on. :) I've also been watching the live feeds for the last two seasons, and find that that makes the show a lot more interesting. It's fun to see what the producers actually put on the show, as opposed to what really happens in the house. For the most part, their editing is pretty good - meaning that they portray what happens fairly accurately. However, it's always fun to get the full and unedited version when you're watching it live!
