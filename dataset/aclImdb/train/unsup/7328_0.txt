Ki-Duk Kim is one of my favorite directors. In this movie, we see reflections of Samaria and Bom yeoreum gaeul gyeoul geurigo bom. The old man is preparing the girl for the real world. Fishermen that come to boat blame the old man for keeping her in the boat for 10 years and that he wants to marry her and use her for his sexual needs. Even the girl thinks that way and starts stopping the old man from grabbing her arm in bed. But the old man knows what everybody else doesn't. He is waiting for the right time to free her. The right time is her 17th birthday. With the involvement of the young boy, old man rips the calendar pages off deciding to execute his plan earlier. Old man's spirit having sex with the girl is a part of the preparation for freedom. He frees her from her virginity. <br /><br />In Samaria, father cannot stop her daughter from early age sex, gives up trying to win and protect her and leaves the daughter on her own. In Hwal, old man is successful. Ki-Duk is against early age sex but he is also against the taboo of virginity. The boat and the bow protects the girl from dangers outside just lake the house on the lake in Bom yeoreum. <br /><br />In Bom Yeoreum, the student monk leaves the lake before the preparation is complete. And he returns with anger, hopelessness and blood in his hands. <br /><br />In Hwal, old man does everything to stop that from happening. He scares the fishermen with his bow, stops them from touching her and finally stops the girl and the young boy from leaving before the preparation is complete by tying the rope around his neck with the other end on the moving boat.
