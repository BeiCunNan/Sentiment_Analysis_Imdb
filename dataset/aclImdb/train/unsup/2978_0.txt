If you are sick and tired of Shahrukh Khan playing the same role all the time (until recent Swades), watch some of his old flicks. If you think, he is only good at one role, you are wrong. He is a versatile actor, and one of my favorite actors. He is truly a good actor, and luckily he is playing different roles after Veer-Zaara (but Veer-Zaara and Main Hoon Na were kind of different). Over here, he is a continuation of his perky self in DDLJ. The concept of the character may be different, but who cares as long as he doesn't bore. The concept of the movie is very interesting. I personally thought real people can relate to this (dictating bosses taking pride possessions). The movie does bore you at moments, and it has it's usual clich√©s. This movie is from 1997, but outdated looks always gets in the way of the movie. But it's the actors who are the real stars. Juhi Chawla also blows you away with a charming performance (and beautiful looks). We know she is above this level, and it's sad how she departed from commercial cinema. But if we are patient, she might come back. Aditya Pancholi was perfect. I may have not liked the character, but wait..... wasn't that the point. You know when a character is hated when he is supposed to, the actor does no wrong. Johnny Lever, Gulshan Grover, and that friend of Shahrukhs were all adequate. The songs were very nice. My favorite song, in general, was Jaata Hai Tu Kahan (Where Do You Go?) presented in a perky matter. However Main Koi Aisa Geet Gaoon (If I Sing a Song Like This) and Chand Taare (Moon, Stars) were also nice and creative. Suniye To (Listen So) tried to be another Rukh Ja O Dil Deewane (DDLJ), but the choreography couldn't match up. But Ek Din Aap (One Day You....) succeeded in becoming a Hum Aapke Hain Koun. This movie is a must-see for Shahrukh Khan and Juhi Chawla.
