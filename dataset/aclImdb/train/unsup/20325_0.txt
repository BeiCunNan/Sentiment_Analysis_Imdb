I just saw the movie "Dead Doll" and you should too, if you like original script and weird sentimental human reaction! A disheartened and disillusioned sculptor kills his beautiful -barbie like- girlfriend and entombs her body into a lifelike blonde doll. The doll travels from one owner to the next, seducing men and women and luring them to weird and catastrophic actions. AMAZING....the story of a doll that everybody love and lust!!! Great cinematography...funny and beautiful!!! Not as good as the film May but... good enough!!! Satirical, cynical, fantastic!!! B-movie but also a great piece of cinema: cinema as the product of the imaginary, creative and humorous human being! It's like reading an adult-horror-funny comic! Defenetaly I would recommend to see it because, probably, you haven't seen something like that... so it's worth it!!!
