This for me is a must see film for independent film fans everywhere. The acting is great and is put together very well. Also the use of animation works perfectly. Its a shame that this film is only available on a region 1 format as I believe there would be a demand for it especially in the UK. The story is interesting, showing how a group of close friend perceive the world in very different ways when on acid and not. I think there are characters in the film that everyone can relate to and comes together very well. Its a film that I have watched again and again taking something new from it each time. You may need to be patient with this but is worth the effort.
