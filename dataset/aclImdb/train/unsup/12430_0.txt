The third Dogme film, "Mifune" is the best film of the decade. Characters are nicely developed, and pictures are beautifully shot. I can't believe that it is shot without filters and only available light. Nice plot. Kresten's Toshiro Mifune is wonderful. I just want to say "Thank you for showing this wonderful piece" 10 of 10
