I decided to watch this film as despite that it seemed to have a ridiculously low budget, there were some very good-looking guys in it. I have to say that there was not one good aspect to this entire film. The story line is weak and completely unrealistic whilst the writing is painful. There was no passion between any of the actors and the main thing i could not get to grips with was how everyone "fell in love" with someone else after seeing them for two seconds. If the main character does not annoy you to death, then Billy's (played by Jonah) portrayal of a masochist in an S&M relationship will! The main character is unintelligent and full of himself. The director's poor attempt at making the characters seem poetic or artistic is laughable. The whole 'music store' scene is clearly an attempt to make these boys look deeper than regular 'club-kids'. It failed. The attempts at poetry or deep conversation are as pathetic as the acting! AVOID THIS MOVIE!
