This comedy has potential and undoubtedly follows in the vein of "embarrassing situation comedies" dominating our screens nowadays, i.e., the office, curb your enthusiasm, extras; you catch my drift. Seeing as i'm a fan of all of these brilliant comedies you'd think I'd like this sketch show. But unfortunately, there is a fine line between imitating a popular style and using it, stretching it out so far that it becomes tedious and predictable. In short, this sketch show falls among the latter. There are some strong and pleasing sketches but the rest are clich√©d. The "comedy" evolves from the actors after a few sketches, however after a while even their performances become tedious and predictable. The only plus side to their performance is their dominance over the script that fails to evoke any comedy. We tend to overlook the writing and focus on them. If anything, their performances save the poor scripts and without them I wouldn't have glanced at this show. If you pull out the actors and focus on the script, it is mediocre and poor. However, thinking back, I may sound self-contradictory because there was one highlight. One that stood out for me, was when Nick Frost woke up from a one night stand, trudges silently downstairs and comes across a picture of him and the lady he slept with, married, including another with a child. Eventually, he realises, it is another liaison with his wife. That, i found funny. But the rest slightly poor. However, i did have some expectations for the second series yet unfortunately, the second series failed to meet these expectations. It is rather inconceivable to know that the show's producer & writer is none other than Ash Atalla, the producer of The Office. Nick Frost & Amanda Abbington are great actors, and frankly they are the only great thing in this show.
