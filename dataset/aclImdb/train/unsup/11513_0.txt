The overblown musicals of the 1930s easily set themselves up to get parodied (in my opinion, it was outright inappropriate of Hollywood to make these sorts of movies given that the country was in the midst of the Great Depression). One spoof was Tex Avery's "Page Miss Glory", which has also been known simply as "Miss Glory" to avoid confusion with a movie by the same name. It portrays a bellhop in a hotel in Hicksville awaiting the arrival of a glamorous movie star. When she doesn't come, he dreams that he's a bellhop in an Art Deco hotel probably spoofing the average Fred Astaire flick. But boy does he have a surprise coming at the end! I've always liked how the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons poked fun at the popular culture of their eras. Granted, this is one of the rarer ones (I watched it on YouTube). Apparently, some of the characters are caricatures of the Warner Bros. animation staff (among them Chuck Jones). Either way, it's a pretty interesting relic of their early days.
