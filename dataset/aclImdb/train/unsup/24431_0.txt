For those looking for the ultimate '80's movie, look elsewhere. For those looking for an epic movie, this isn't it. For those looking for some sort of microcosm of New Jersey, (... some of you people boggle me) apparently this won't do it for ya.<br /><br />-BUT-<br /><br />If you're looking for a movie where plot plays accompaniment to emotional depth this movie is perfect for you. Uma Thurman and Juliette Lewis give their most true to life and demanding roles of their careers. I loved every second of this movie; every awkward pause, every song,(especially the use of the phil collins song in the bar.. i don't even like phil collins.. just thought it was perfect) and every line of dialogue.<br /><br />BTW.. those of you claiming that this movie stinks and it's not an accurate representation of new jersey... should think about what they're saying. if you claim a movie stinks, than it can be nothing but a representation of new jersey.. c'mon, drive down the NJ turnpike with your windows down and take a good sniff.
