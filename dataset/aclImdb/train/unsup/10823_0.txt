At best I was expecting a campy B movie with a little T & A and well, Big Bad Wolf delivered in spades. Derek Cowley steals the key to his step-dad's cabin in an effort to impress the local cool kids and get a little party action on. Derek's friend Sam, a leather wearing tomboy on a motorcycle, on whom he has a not-so-secret crush, is talked into going along. On their way to the cabin the teenagers meet a local who warns them to stay away from the cabin but of course the warning is unheeded. It doesn't take long before animal passions are running wild and I don't just mean the sex crazed teenagers.<br /><br />Once the initial action and gore is over, something unusual for a direct to video movie happened... an interesting and engaging story broke out about Derek's abusive step-dad, Mitchell, the effect on his mother, his relationship with Sam and the truth about his father's death. A visit from Uncle Charley leads Sam into a situation that jeopardizes her relationship with Derek while uncovering the truth about Mitchell and putting all their lives in danger. Don't get me wrong, you won't see this picture mentioned at the Oscars, but the acting and direction are competently done and the special effects are really fantastic. Even more amazing when you learn what a short time-span they had to put everything together and learn their roles. Just because some of you will want to know... the girls are cute and all but one have real breasts.<br /><br />I would recommend this highly to fans of campy horror like Feast, Slither and Shaun of the Dead. Don't expect to be scared or particularly grossed out (unless you have a weak stomach) but do expect to be entertained.
