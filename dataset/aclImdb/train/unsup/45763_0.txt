I am a pretty harsh critic which annoys my girlfriend to no end, but I will always try to find at least one good point in any movie. Apart from some Kevin costner films and the "epic/superhero/etc movie" series I don't think there are many films that would make me want to walk out of a cinema.<br /><br />This movie takes the cake. The film begins with the senseless torture and killing of a kitten at which point I attempted to walk out but was stopped partly by my girlfriend and partly by the fact that I had blown $32 for the tickets.<br /><br />Anyway I tried my best to forget about such a tasteless start and tried to get into the spirit of a suspenseful thriller. From this point on the movie treats the audience like a child. Computers bleep and boop every time a key is touched, intensely suspenseful over-the-top music at almost EVERY single point of the movie (no matter how un-suspenseful the moment actually is) and the creators try to get across a message that people are inherently evil for wanting to watch torture when that is exactly what the audience is sitting there watching! There was not a single moment when I was scared. There was not a single moment I was even a little bit worried for any of the characters (except maybe the kitten). This movie is not that sort of tragic-bad where you can kind of laugh at the mistakes and hypocrisies, it is more of a bad that makes you a little bit nauseated afterward.<br /><br />I regret not walking out sooner as I will never get that 2 hours back. I am actually tempted to try to find some way of getting my money back from the film's creators as I feel dirty for supporting this movie with my hard earned $.<br /><br />Enough with my ranting. I'll just finish by saying that I wouldn't normally even write a review but this film really got me fired up inside and it just had to be vented!
