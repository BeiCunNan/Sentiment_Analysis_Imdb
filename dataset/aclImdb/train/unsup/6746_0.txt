I was skeptical to rent this movie after seeing some of the bad comments on imdb, but sometimes you have to take the plunge and decide for yourself. Thank God, I did and didn't listen to all of you who poo-pood this film. Binder is hilarious. He has a way of capturing the moment in his expression like great comedians (which he is) do. His film-making is nicely done as well, keeping the camera on his character as things go wrong, so you can wretch along with him. Hemingway is really a truly unsung actress. She can do anything, and here she and Binder are the perfect funny couple. Whoever said in their review that Binder is no Woody Allen was wrong. If you like Allen, Billy Crystal, Christopher Guest, Chevy Chase, Martin Short, Steve Martin: the greats, etc., you'll love this film. I promise!
