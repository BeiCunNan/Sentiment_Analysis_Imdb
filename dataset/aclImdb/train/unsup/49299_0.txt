I saw this movie on a flight to Florida...and I turned it off. There was nothing else to do...but I turned it off. It was awful! It really is a shame b/c the idea had great potential...the script was poorly written, poorly executed and just plain boring! It was like the Talented Mr Ripley...I kept waiting and waiting for it to get better...until the wait became excruciating!! LOL Take a pass on this one
