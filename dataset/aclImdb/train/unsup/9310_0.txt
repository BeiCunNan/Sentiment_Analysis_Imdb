I sat down to watch this expecting a b movie, not great but one that was still entertaining - I didn't get that, I watched it with a friend of mine and we didn't talk to each other for half an hour after it finished simply because we were in shock at how bad it was.<br /><br />Considering it was the most expensive oil rig ever you'd think they'd have paint in more colours than battleship grey, you'd think the dining room table for 24 people wouldn't be the size to seat 6, and you'd expect a couple of other actors floating here and there! Maybe if the script had of been half decent it would of stood a chance, but in one scene 2 minutes is wasted on the female lead asking where the toilet is!?!!!!<br /><br />To be fair there are a couple of memorable lines, but the kind you remember because you can never understand how anyone ever thought they were good!<br /><br />Basically if you wish to watch it, its an experience that you will never ever forget, but we actually felt ourselves getting stupider whilst watching it, it seriously drained all enthusiasm for life out of us!
