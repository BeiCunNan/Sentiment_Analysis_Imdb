Throughout the movie, and then reading about the woman afterwards, I felt complete and utter anger at the legal system for allowing something like this to happen. How dare they be able to decide what is best for a child, on the basis of his mother being a lesbian? This movie literally made me want to throw things, and by the end, I was crying in desperation at how sad Zachary sounded, and shaking my head when the verdict was said. I don't think I could have hated Nancy anymore than I did.<br /><br />Valerie Bertinelli was amazing in this, though.<br /><br />I think people...mainly lawyers and homo-phobics should take a long, hard look at this movie, and see how things like this can affect people. By the end, what Nancy saw as the best thing for Zachary, was the worst thing she could have ever have done, and it's a shame that in the end, the real Jody Ann Shaffell had no fight left, and gave up.
