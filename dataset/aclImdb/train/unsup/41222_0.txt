<br /><br />After Seeing the other works of the directors (Coneheads & The Last Unicorn) I didn't really expect much in this movie, since its older and the directors might not have done better earlier in their career. I also didn't think it could get any worse, but it did. You start off with the dwarves meeting Bilbo a little too fast, and the music starts. The horrible music was so annoying I could hardly concentrate on the plot of the movie. When they get to after they meet the eagles I though they had skipped a part of the movie. I thought they really screwed up, but no they left out an important character (Beorn). I believe he was too important to just skip him. He was a big part in helping them on their journey. I don't think the goblins really looked good. They don't look like goblins to me they look more like an orc would. I think Don Messick should have stuck to doing the voice of Scooby Doo. To me he wasn't a good Bilbo. If they rated the movie today they would probably give it a G rating (in less the deaths of some of the creatures was too violent). Most of the voices were good but they were just stuck with a bad project and bad directors who seem to get stuck with bad movies a lot more.
