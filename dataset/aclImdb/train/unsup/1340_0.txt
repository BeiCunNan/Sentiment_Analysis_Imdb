This 1997 "movie" is meant to be a comedy but after about an hour I switched it off as if there was anything remotely amusing, I did not see it.<br /><br />The story: spoilt brat daughter of a zillionaire fakes her own kidnapping to try to get the attention of daddy, but things go wrong as she is mistakenly captured by a car thief.<br /><br />All the actors in the film are wholly unconvincing.<br /><br />Post 9/11 and Baghdad....I don't think making a film about kidnapping is funny, especially as this one ain't got anything going for it and what is more it simply ain't funny!<br /><br />In real life someone stealing top of the range motor vehicles would not hesitate in getting rid of any witness rather than falling in love with her, which appears to be the ludicrous premise of the film.<br /><br />The actor playing the private detective brought in to rescue the daughter suffers from always being in awful 'B' pictures, and his hair transplant with phoney red hair looks ridiculous.<br /><br />The actress playing the daughter is completely unattractive in every way except physically. And the good guy car thief is a total jerk.<br /><br />Plus a script lacking in any merit whatsoever.<br /><br />1 out of 10.
