"Gloomy Sunday" was based on a real song that was actually thought to be responsible for an outbreak of suicides. The music is quite haunting and lovely, although I still feel quite strongly that "Life is good" and I am not struck with a desire to end it all.<br /><br />I'm not sure how much of the rest of the film is 'true,' but I found it quite enjoyable. It screened here in Austin as part of the local Jewish Film Festival, and I found it as interesting as anything I saw a couple of weeks ago during SxSW Film.<br /><br />It almost reminded me of one of my favorite films: "1900." Not quite, but it might have been better to mimic that film's beginning and ending just a bit more closely.
