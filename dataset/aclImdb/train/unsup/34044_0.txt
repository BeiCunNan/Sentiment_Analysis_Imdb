I don't know how this movie got made, it is not even a story. I kept waiting for it to start. No arc, no character development. I watch lots of movies and usually find something redeeming. Nothing here except some decent acting and cinematography. I am so surprised at some of the actors in this film that they would decided to waste their talent on a project like this. If someone could explain this film I would love to understand what it was trying to say. Maybe a warning to the youth of today that are starting to behave like those of the eighties? Or possibly it is just an exercise in acting and cinematography? I haven't seen a movie this bad since JCVD's "the quest" and that was actually better. People seriously, watching this movie is worse than being one of the character in it.
