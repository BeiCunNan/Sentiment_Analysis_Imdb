Wow i'm vote no 5000 a lot of people must love this movie too. Harrison Ford has played some great characters over the last 25 years but Jack Ryan rocks. As far as Tom Clancy stories go the Jack Ryan ones are the greatest. I just hope that more Ryan movies are made, they deserve to be... I rated this as a 10/10 movie only because the chart does not have any higher scores.
