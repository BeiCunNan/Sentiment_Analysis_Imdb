Hi i just wanted to say that i am 16 and my parents always let me watch BaBar. I cannot even describe to you how amazing that show is. I still love it today and wish they still aired it...I suggest you find out where you can get the videos, buy them, and let your children see them...it is a very entertaining show. as i grew up i forgot about BaBar then after a while i began thinking about what my favorite TV show was. and i remembered that it was Babar. Definitely a A+ 10 out of 10 show. buy it! When i get older i am definitely going to buy it so that my children can watch it just as i did. in fact i even named my rabbit after babar!
