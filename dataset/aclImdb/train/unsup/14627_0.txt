OK this movie really sucked, i mean i liked aamir khan but kajol just sucked. I think they shouldve added srk to the movie with kajol it would be a little better, but o well. I watched and the first half was pointless but at least the second half was a little better with the Twists. Aamir Khan hands down is a good terrorist, but adding a blind girl? eh no!hopefully Aamir KHan will do much better at Mani Ratnam film. Does anyone know if they are still making the Mahabatra? anwayz i advise anyone do not see this bad movie, itll make u sleep, and its soo freakishly long. I couldn't stay up watching this, but I mean I think Veer Zaara is much better then this story.So If id give this a movie out of 5 id give this a 1 or a 0.5
