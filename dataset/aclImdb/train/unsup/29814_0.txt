Excellent action movie. Joan Allen gives a tremendous performance. Jason Stratham is great. Good story, to the point, uncomplicated. Special effects do not get in the way of the story. Production design is consistent with sense of foreboding and danger that permeates the movie. Most characters are two-dimensional but for this kind of movie, it's okay. The movie is overtly violent, but not gratuitously so. The movie has an interesting and upbeat ending and serves as metaphor for the individual's vulnerability to manipulation. The production crew exercised creativity in casting Ms. Allen in a role that is unusual for her and she once again proves her more than ample theatrical talents. Kudos to Ms. Allen!
