This is one of those movies that is just simply enjoyable to watch. I chuckled much of the way through it. I laughed out loud at the antics of Botts when trying to get away from the practicing of our hero. But I precede myself. The hero played by David Niven, who I am an admitted fan of, is a high strung, nervous, major up tight concert pianist and very famous. He is being run by his manager, who in turn runs the butler and every one else who supposedly takes care of David Niven. One day a funny little man comes to see Mr. Niven. The former owner of The Cleopatra Arms, an apartment building played by Victor Moore who is absolutely adorable in the part. Moore takes David Niven to see the building he owns and introduces him to the tenants there. One of the tenants is a model named Polly played by Jane Wyman. As a rule I am not a big fan of Miss Wymans, but in this movie she is quite fetching. Mr. Niven takes one look at her in shorts, is immediately smitten with her and his life begins to change. I do not remember seeing David Niven and Jane Wyman in any other movie together, but in this one they make a very appealing couple. The funniest scene takes place when Jane Wyman, Victor Moore and David Niven are striving to drive the one bad tenant, Potts, out of the Cleopatra Arms by having Niven come and do his 6-8 hour piano practicing in the room next to Potts who works nights and makes everyones life miserable by yelling at them to keep quiet so he can sleep days. Broderick Crawford plays Botts. Crawford usually played such serious roles and rarely had a chance to show his comic flair, but in this movie he gets his chance and he does a very good job. All in all I think this is a very charming movie. I really enjoyed it.
