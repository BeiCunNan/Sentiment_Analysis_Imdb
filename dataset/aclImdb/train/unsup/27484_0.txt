I like Bette Midler as a musical performer. I can tolerate her when used in the right way as an actress. Some say this was an Oscar worthy performance (believe she was nominated), but I disagree. Not because I didn't like her acting, but because I never knew for sure what she was playing - other than pain. That's not her fault of course, but she can't get credit for it either. <br /><br />Thought the film was a mess in general. Most shots were too light or too dark or out of focus or otherwise visually unintelligible. There were sloppy edits and there was no story to speak of. The main characters were one dimensional. All Alan Bates did was scream. It was well acted I supposed - tho the camera didn't catch it nearly as well as it could have - I believed he was selfish and greedy, but because I was told, not shown. <br /><br />Wasn't even that crazy about the concert footage. Midler added a raucousness or squelch to her voice which I suppose was some sort of homage to Janis Joplin but it just made her voice sound less pretty. The band was mediocre - this may or may not have been another homage - to Big Brother And The Holding Company - Joplin's backup band which was often criticized for it's mediocrity - but in any case it was ill-advised. <br /><br />Midler's accent was inconsistent - wasn't sure it ever sounded Floridian, which is where her character was from. We were given little background about her life other than one brief story about her promiscuity - so we never got a handle on where her intense pain came from. Okay, it was suggested that she was rejected as a youth, lonely as an adult and searching desperately and unwisely to fill holes and find love. Or do we assume all that because of what we know about Janis Joplin? In any case that's a thin plot reed to hang a two hour running time upon. And it nearly snapped for me several times. I gave it the lowest rating I ever give - 4 - if a film is leaning towards a rating any lower than that I turn the set off.
