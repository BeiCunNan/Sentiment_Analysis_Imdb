As usual, the production values and the acting are top notch, with David Suchet once again performing the perfect Poirot. The historical accuracy is good; the right cars, buildings and clothing for the period make it believable for that time period. As far as the film being a film, it is is good. I'm a big fan of Christie, not just Poirot and Miss Marple, but also her other characters, most of these novels have been made into decent programmes (although when her short stories are adapted for television there is obviously some padding put in,) but in most cases they tend to stick quite close to the source. However, as an adaptation of Agatha Christie's book of the same name, this version is appalling! To the point whereby when my brother recorded this for me at it's first showing, he entitled the cassette "The Murder of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd". 'Nuff said?
