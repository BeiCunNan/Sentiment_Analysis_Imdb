This movie is awesome and definitely worth seeing. But you have to take it for what its worth. It IS an independent film. This film is awesome but you need to be in the right mindset and it surly isn't a Disney film. This film has such a wide range of emotions, one minute your happy for the characters and the next your angry. The acting is great and not to mentions the hot lead characters.(Ben has this face that makes your heart melt) The ending is perfect... well its not the Disney ending we all were hoping for but it fits well. You will want to watch this movie over and over again its so great. This is a movie everyone should see!!!
