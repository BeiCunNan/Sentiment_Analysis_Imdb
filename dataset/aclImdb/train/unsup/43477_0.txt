The only distinction here is seeing BELA LUGOSI in a color horror film--or, I should say, in a horrific B-film photographed in a process called "Natural Color" that makes anything Ed Wood did in the realm of horror look like Masterpiece Theater.<br /><br />The silly script has a woman in a morgue recalling how she got there and therein lies the only novel idea in the script. How actors like GEORGE ZUCCO, DOUGLAS FOWLEY, NAT PENDLETON and JOYCE COMPTON got talked into putting this one on their resume is anybody's guess.<br /><br />The script is a complete misfire from beginning to end, nothing is ever explained and there are loopholes galore in what one can make of the convoluted plot. A green mask keeps appearing in a window for no discernible reason until a weak explanation comes late in the story involving a blindfold and a man's vengeance when betrayed by his wife.<br /><br />Sorry, can't recommend this to anyone except "bad movie buffs" who have to see any horror film ever made, no matter how bad. Appalling dialogue is never for a moment believable and neither NAT PENDLETON nor JOYCE COMPTON are given comic material that offers any relief.
