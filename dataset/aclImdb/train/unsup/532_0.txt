An tense and atmospheric film following four teenagers from an English fee-paying school who plan to spend a weekend partying in an abandoned bomb shelter but end up locked in for 10 days with food and drink running short.<br /><br />The film is held together by Thora Birch who has a very challenging role as Liz, the films central character. The rest of the largely unknown cast provide excellent support.<br /><br />What brings this film above the run of the mill teen thriller is the intelligence of the writing which places this film nearer "Se7en" or "Fight Club" than "Scream" or "I Know What You Did Last Summer".<br /><br />A must see for anyone who likes a film whose scares come from something deeper than loud bangs and psychos in masks, and whose characters have more depth than your average high school cheer-leader.
