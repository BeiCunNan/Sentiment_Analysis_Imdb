This movie which was good in action lacked in the court room scenes. Throughout the movie I was waiting for something to grip me and hold me to my seat, but then there was nothing. It left me with the question, "That's it?". The first thing I thought of was when Tommy Lee Jones's character went to the American Embassy and he saw the holes in the wall on the outside of the building. Why couldn't he determine the angle at which the bullets were fired from. There were holes where the bullets did penetrate, so there would have been something to give him hard proof that there were at least some shots that came from the ground. As for the court room scene, I was supprised at the verdict, because there was so little evidence to even help the defense.<br /><br />
