This movie was made back in the day when Hollywood produced incredible movies with incredible story lines. This movie is about a writer named Joe and he is in a lot of trouble. The men are coming to repossess his car but he escapes and parks it into a garage next to a house that he believes is abandoned. Inside lives a former aging silent film actress and her butler. Her name is Norma and she is going to help Joe write her script so that she can make a comeback. The problem is that Norma is a little pulled away from reality. She takes over Joe's life.<br /><br />What a great movie with perfect acting and a great story. It's a little sad in a way too. I really liked Norma's eyes. They looked like the eyes of a crazy lady. Only a crazy lady would buy a coffin for her monkey and have a funeral.
