Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie (1997) <br /><br />Starring: Johnny Yong Bosch, Nakia Burrise, Jason David Frank, Catherine Sutherland, Amy Jo Johnson, Steve Cardenas, Austin St. John, Blake Foster <br /><br />Directed by: David Winning, Shuki Levy <br /><br />Plot outline: The Power Rangers must protect an alien creature from a villain that wants to release a great evil imprisoned on an island.<br /><br />My thoughts: I really don't like this movie, first off, it's not a movie, it's more like a 90 minute episode of the TV show, as a matter of fact, that's what the movie should have been, a 3 part season premiere, second problem: the title, why is it called Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie and not just Power Rangers: Turbo just like the show, also, why isn't this a sequel to the first film?, I mean, come on, can't you just at least make a more proper sequel, I know this was after most of the original cast left, but dang, also, the special effects were worser than the effects in the first one, they look like something a nerd would do on After Effects, the Justin kid was so annoying, he's not even worthy of being the Blue Ranger, the Lerigot character angered me, he looks like a cross between an Ewok and a troll baby doll, the villains are dumb, however, I did like the soundtrack, and there a few decent action scenes, but that's it.<br /><br />Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie should have stayed on the IMDb bottom 100 list, 1.5/10.
