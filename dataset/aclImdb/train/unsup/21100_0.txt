Steve "The Sandman" Sandkuhler lights up the screen in his Oscar nominated portrayal of Terry Luttrell, lead singer of REO Speedwagon, as Tony Malanowski unfolds his first masterpiece, "Night of Horror." From the well lit cinematography to the intelligent dialog, Sandkuhler shows that he's no lightweight in Hollywood. Perhaps that's because he's never stepped foot in the town.<br /><br />This movie involves sixty minutes of losers from the 1970's riding around in a Winnebago while listening to some skank-hippie chick recite "The Raven" by Poe, then run into the ghosts of Confederate soldiers who lead them to the plastic Halloween candy skull of their captain. Also, there's a compelling scene where Sandkuhler's Luttrell recaps the movie to his bandmate and uses the story as an excuse for why he can't resume his status as a "big California rock star." <br /><br />0 Stars
