I first saw this movie when I was five years old, and I LOVED it! <br /><br />For many years afterwards, this movie remained in obscurity to me, it seemed I was to never see it again, until one day, I put it on request. I know own it on DVD, I whenever I'm in the mood for something funny, I watch this movie! <br /><br />Abbott and Costello are my favorite comedy duo, they made some of the funniest movies I have ever seen! Though Martin and Lewis had beaten them out of the top ten box office in the later years, the are still considered the best.<br /><br />That Martin and Lewis team, they are very funny, but they cannot hold a candle to Abbott and Costello the greatest of them all! Abbott and Costello are the kings of comedy! <br /><br />Very Funny! <br /><br />10/10
