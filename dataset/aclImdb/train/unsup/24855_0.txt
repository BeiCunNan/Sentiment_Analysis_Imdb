Bobbie Gentry's artful haunting ballad "Ode to Billy Joe", centering on a family's dinnertable discussion of a local tragedy amid accounts of everyday happenings, is the inspiration for this film. At the time of it's release, the song inspired much speculation about the events and characters, so it was inevitable that a film version would eventually be released. The film casts Glynnis O'Conner and Robby Benson as the narrator and the subject of the song. The two talented young actors very authentically portray the intensity and passion of the modern-day Romeo and Juliet. The failing of the movie is its failure to capture the raw simplicity of the ballad, and the plot comes off as contrived or even sensationalistic. The screenwriters miss the opportunity to develop a central theme in the ballad - the irony of isolation and loneliness in a context of seeming closeness and intimacy.
