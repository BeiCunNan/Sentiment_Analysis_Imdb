I haven't seen the cartoon of Dennis the menace, but saw the movie as a kid and thought it was good back then,but watching it now i have realized how boring it is. Although, i've always admired the robber, I thought there was wonderful acting shown by Christopher Lloyd. Walter Matthieu was also good, as well as mason gamble. The music played through the movie was good but got a bit monotonous at times. I liked the music played when the bad guy was around. The opening scene was done well with the music and it gave us a good look at the relationship between Dennis and Mr. Wilson. I like how each time something happened he actually didn't mean it to happen.
