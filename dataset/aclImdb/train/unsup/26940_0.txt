I had high hopes for this film. I like Jet Li, love Bridget Fonda, and it was produced by Luc Beeson. Sounds like a sure fire hit, right? Wrong!<br /><br />The film is so over the top that it becomes unbelievable very quickly. The French bad guy, Richard, kills innocent civilians several times yet carries on as if nothing has happened. Bridget Fonda is more of a hinderance than a help to Jet Li, and her character is very degrading towards women. The background of Bert Kwouk's character is never explained, and neither is Jet Li's acupuncture skills which save his life more than once. And what was with the dead rabbit at the start of the film?<br /><br />Avoid, avoid, avoid. There are much better examples of Li's and Fonda's work available from their impressive back catalogue. I think that this one will be forgotten by all concerned.
