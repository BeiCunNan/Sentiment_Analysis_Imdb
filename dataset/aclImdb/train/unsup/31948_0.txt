I saw this movie on opening day,1981.It enthralled and depressed me a little at the same time,and I could never figure out why....till now.I am an Arthurian buff without being a fanatic.I have "Knights of the Round Table","Sword of Lancelot","Excalibur",even the obscure"Young Arthur,Warlord"[from british TV.] I've read Tennyson,Mallory,and Steinbeck.I've read historians who have pursued the authentic Arthur. After reading the many comments on this site,I slapped it on again today.Those remarks praising the use of Wagner's music as used in the film were just a little off the mark.This whole film is Wagner minus the arias.Richard would have loved this!There is a near cultish devotion to the nobility of barbarism in it's purest form.Lancelot was heroic ,literally till the armor came off.If Boorman hadn't thrown in the occasional reference to justice for everyone I believe Hitler himself would have financed this film.This is close to Aryan mysticism [without the Aryans].I'm surprised Boorman mellowed to the point he could make "Hope and Glory".Aside from the Wagnerian fatalism,I still love this film! Forget the 14th century plate armor,17th century saddles,and polo ponies with polo bridles.This is still the best Arthur to date!![And if you think this film is long and covers too much ;read Mallory.]
