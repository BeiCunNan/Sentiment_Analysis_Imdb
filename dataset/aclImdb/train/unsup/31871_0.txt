A beautiful teacher Miss Panor has six students.They decide to play a cruel prank on Ms.Panor and her reputation is ruined.The teacher then turns to black magic to exact gruesome revenge."Art of the Devil 2" is a gore-soaked horror film which was directed by a team of seven filmmakers known as the Ronin Team.The direction is solid,the cast is pretty good,but the storyline is hardly dynamic.When the gore appears it is unrelenting and disgusting.Miss Panor is an great villain and truly remorseless killer.The gore is rather hard to stomach for example toenails are torn out,teeth are plucked,live geckos burst out of a boy's back,one hapless girl gouges her own eyes out and the skin on man's legs is burned by a blow-torch.Overall,I enjoyed "Art of the Devil 2" more than its predecessor.Give it a look.
