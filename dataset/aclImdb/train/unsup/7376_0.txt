I had the pleasure of seeing this movie twice. Once while attending the Garden State Film Festival and a second time in my home town in the Connecticut Film Festival. Normally I would never Pay to see a movie twice.<br /><br />This action adventure thrill ride is near and dear to any guy/girl who is young at heart. The story combined with thrills made the movie easy to relate to. The Flyboys is definitely the best adventure movie I have scene ever, and that is coming from a film major who sees movies all the time. The story had the viewers demanding for what came next and on the edge through out the entire movie.<br /><br />The way that this movie connects to you, is how you can relate to it. The characters and choice of the characters was great and they worked together amazingly well as if they knew each other their entire life. Most times after you see a independent film there is always one character that stands out due to bad acting. This did not exist, and let the viewer instantly connect with the characters as if they were sitting next to them. <br /><br />With out spoiling the movie I need to Jump to the Creator Rocco DeVilliers. Rocco has created a movie that looks like it required 100 million but only done with two million. He has made a film that was made over the course of 7 years. His movie has beaten all the other independent films at the festivals I have been to. I walked out of all the other movies saying that was good but not as good as "The Flyboys". <br /><br />The question remains why hasn't the movie been released in theaters every where? The answer is "LA won't take it" . After hearing Rocco say this at both film festivals the audience was instantly appalled and began to boo.<br /><br />The best thing that you can do after reading this review is to watch "The Flyboys". With out spoiling the movie I could not give a in depth review to prove to you how well this film was made, but at least now you know what you can do to help the progress of this wonderful film.<br /><br />PS. the guy who said this would be better than the new Indiana Jones, he was absolutely right.
