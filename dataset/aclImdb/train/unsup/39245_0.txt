Just caught this last night on TCM. It's got some moments, but overall it drags. Stoler as Martha has an early scene where she quits/is fired that's priceless and when her mother plays the guilt card on her ... that rings as true to life for anyone raised Catholic. However, as the story progresses and the bodies rack up the film takes on a John Waters-feel (i.e.- Serial Mom). There are scenes that play like comedy when they should be tragic: the lake/picnic scenes w/ our main LOON trying to drown herself stops any pretense to dramatic tension in it's tracks. In scenes that take place in the bedrooms that Martha shares w/ the unknowing, prospective brides there's a "Throw Momma From The Train"-feel to them that begs the question why any of the brides-to-be even puts up w/ Martha's awful behavior. Let alone swallow pills pro-offered by Martha!?!<br /><br />There's some dramatic redemption towards the last ten minutes when the story finally delivers the best sequence as Martha orchestrates the murders (mother and child) that will eventually close the grisly story. The film is terribly photographed and the sound recording is the worst of any film I've reviewed on IMDb.
