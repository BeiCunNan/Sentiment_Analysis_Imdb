The story is surely interesting, and all actors have performed their part very well and with all the resources it had  it was a sure formula for success!? But a big "NO" is the answer. The movie fails to connect and I felt as if I am viewing a sober re-make of 70-80's movie "Raj Tilak". This is a movie for all students studying Script writing and Director (in that order). It perfectly shows "What one should avoid" when writing a script and directing a movie. I am 100% sure that each and every scene and detail is well crafted out in the script  word by word, image by image, page by page, and that is reflected on the screen.<br /><br />But the whole approach is immature  coming from a veteran director. The characterization is poor, each scene is like a stand alone scene of enacted on stage, each single scene is stretched to unbearable limit of irritation, the music on the over-stretched scene is jarring, the sync sound is badly recorded, each dialogue is a pick-up from 60-70s pot boiler, and even with range of emotions given to the characters, all actors are under-utilized and wasted.<br /><br />A good movie on paper does not necessary result in a good movie on screen  is the big, loud and clear message one gets after seeing this crap.<br /><br />Only saving grace of this movie is the cinematography. On the other hand, if you blindly follow Hollywood players, or believe that purely by eliminating songs and putting in gorgeous imagery you automatically transcend all flaws of the typical feelbad-flick and will get to watch a better film, then this one is for you.
