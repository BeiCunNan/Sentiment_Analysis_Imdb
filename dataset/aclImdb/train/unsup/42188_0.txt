The mockumentary "Farce of the Penguins" is obviously an attempt to cash in on the success of "March of the Penguins" while at the same time making fun of it. Narrated by Samuel L. Jackson, it is about two penguins, Carl (Bob Sagat), who is suffering from an identity crisis and heartbroken from past romantic failures, and his buddy Jimmy (Lewis Black), who only wants to eat and get laid, and their 70-mile travel to the penguin mating grounds in order to get some love.<br /><br />Basically, the filmmakers take some stock footage of some penguins and try and make and tie it together with a very basic plot that you'd find in a teen romantic film. It didn't inspire much interest for me. Throughout the process, numerous scatological humor is thrown in. The problem is, the film isn't very funny. I found most of the humor stupid, in which only teenagers (a market this film doesn't cater to)would find funny. Plus, I think Bob Sagat and Lewis Black take their roles too seriously. They compromise some humor in an effort to tell a story, which will be hard to do when you are trying to do so with only stock footage. They were making an 80-minute film (short by today's standards) a chore to get through, which was sad. It probably would've been much more entertaining had they played their roles loosely.<br /><br />However, I'd be lying if I said there weren't some good moments in the film. Samuel L. Jackson was quite entertaining, but sadly underutilized. I also found Tracy Morgan's role to be fun as well. Plus, at times I found the humor to be entertaining when the editing made it feel like their conversations were getting awkward.<br /><br />However, these few moments of humor have made a bad film into a below-average film. It is barely worth a rent. The most entertaining thing that came out of this picture is the fake interview Bob Sagat did for the special features section, which is 10 times funnier and about 1/5 the length of the film. Quite telling. 4 out of 10.
