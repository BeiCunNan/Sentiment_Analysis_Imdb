I don't know if its the way the lead guy and his stupid friends see the group of helpful women as possible prostitutes or whether its Ajith Kumar's incredibly irritating screen presence or the director's total lack of judgment or the incredibly stupid title, that makes me think this is another of the really crappy movies that come from Tamil Cinema. The movie is incredibly bad, too bad that even A.R.Rahman couldn't save it with really lackluster music and songs, he cant be blamed though there was nothing to get inspired to make even decent music. Ajith was great during his "mugavari" days when he portrayed such a likable character. He is plain pathetic now. I don't even know why I waste my time writing him reviews.
