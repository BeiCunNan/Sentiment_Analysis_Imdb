This has to be one of my all time greats despite its cheekiness and poor model reproductions of oil rigs! Its still captives me every time after having seen it possibly more than 30 times, if anyone reading this could explain the scene to me where Harald (cramers No.2 guy) says that it feels like the last minute and asks about the escape plan. I would be grateful as I have never understood this scene. The film on the whole is tailor made for Roger Moore and he fits into the quirky character like a glove and it is also very ironic that he buddies up with the American "Mr. King" who plays the production platform offshore installation manager as Moore also stars with the same actor in many of his James Bond movies. I think the part of Cramer (Anthony Perkins) was played brilliantly with special focus on the "flip outs" that he performs when he begins to realise that his master plan isn't exactly going to plan. All in all a top movie despite what most of my friends say!
