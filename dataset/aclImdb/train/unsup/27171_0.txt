100 Women (as it is called here in New Zealand) is touted as "the sexy follow up to 100 Girls". Well, while both movies have no relation directly to each other, 100 Women is practically the same story... but with 'Women' that are only a couple of years older than the 'Girls'! 100 Girls is the better of the two movies, and is not essential prior viewing , but it does give you an indication of what to expect from 100 Women.<br /><br />The story basically resolves around a loser (Donella) who meets the perfect girl (Bartlet, who is very easy on the eyes), but then loses her number, so does everything he can to find her. An interesting premise, but very similar to that in 100 Girls.<br /><br />The main character is very unlikeable and there are some terrible gross out gags (pulling out nose-hairs anyone?) and it even has Clint Howard in a cameo. But the dialogue seems forced and coming straight from the screen-writers pen, rather than from a real life character.<br /><br />Overall, an average 'teen comedy', but to enjoy do not take it seriously, or else you will feel as though your life has been wasted.<br /><br />4/10
