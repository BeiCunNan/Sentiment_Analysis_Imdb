Cheesiest, sappiest, pathetic... caught this on HBO at 3am, only timeslot it could ever fit. BUT, I'd rather watch the Girls Gone Wild infomercial I've seen on Comedy Central 20 times at this time of night rather than this. This was a poor attempt at something to the effect of "100 Girls." The acting was typical for a movie in this genre.. nothing much there to complain about, if you're going to willingly watch a movie like this in the first place. This movie needed some actual nudity to make it worthy of watching just for the girl-factor, cause there is definitely some eye-candy, but the plot/dialog is just so grating that it becomes painful at times. I think this is the first comment I've been compelled to write, and I use imdb all the time - the last scene with the girls in slow-motion jumping around for the papers just p***ed me off that much. Wish I'd fallen asleep two hours ago. Maybe I'm just grouchy. ;)
