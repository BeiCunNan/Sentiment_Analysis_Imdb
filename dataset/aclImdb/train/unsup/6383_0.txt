When they played The Face on the Milk Carrton on TV I was rather excited, reading the books and all. But I saw an awfully done job. First of all, all of the names were changed, from the original book version, which I hate.<br /><br />Second, many key parts were cut from the book. Another thing is, they combined Book One and Two together, (Book two, being in the lat hour of the film)which I think ruins the series. The acting was fine however. The direction and visuals were fine, but still, I have never seen a more poor adaption than this. I could do better than that with two-three hours. Not to mention I wouldn't combine Books One and Two together, crammed into a two hour movie.<br /><br />Read the books they are so much better
