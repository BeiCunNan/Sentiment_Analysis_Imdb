It's intriguing to me that many of the really good programmes were made in the 70s and 80s. This is a comfortable and funny situation comedy which grows on one like the rambling roses that the landscape gardener would add to his plans. One starts watching, thinking will it be worth it, I haven't seen it for years, and then click! suddenly it reveals its comedy wickedly and hooks you right in there. I can't see any fault in Judi Dench in Comedy - she manages Shakespeare's comedies OK.<br /><br />If you don't need guns and gossip, this is for you. <br /><br />Footnote, I had no idea they were supposed to be 37 and 43. I agree, why pretend to be younger? It works very well with ignorance.
