The movie "RISKY Business" lack of almost everything. I saw it because a lot of people said that it was a good, perfect movie but they are so wrong.I mean just the description and all that fantasy seems so stupid. Then his parents left and all that it was not original. Then about the part where he was doing it was so stupid and pathetic. Why did they make such a pathetic film.I think his first film was so wrong, it just wrong. Then when they were having the party why the police wasn't there? Then all his stuff was gone in just a few hours when truly it takes more than a few hours to packed all of those things. Then he was paying back, like all that stuffed really coop in that small truck. The movie wasn't fun, nor dramatic, nor anything. There wasn't any soul.
