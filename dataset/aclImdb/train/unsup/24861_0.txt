James Dunn had been a personable leading man for Fox in the early 30s but by the 40s alcohol had taken a grip and he was almost unemployable. He still managed to make movies (his big comeback was as the heart- breaking Johnny Nolan in "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn") and he always remained likable. This was the last film for his leading lady, Florence Rice. After this film she moved on to radio and television. She was always the romantic interest - her roles were never meaty but she was pretty and wholesome and was often teamed with Robert Young.<br /><br />Webster (James Dunn) and Jackie Frye (Florence Rice) are newly weds (although they don't act like it) and decide to spend their honeymoon at an old country farmhouse, which is to be their home. Webster is not too keen but Jackie has enthusiasm for both. They are accompanied by their chauffeur Harmony (Sam McDaniells) who thinks that milk comes from the milkman. The farm is giving Webster the heebie jeebies - there is a man tying a noose to a tree, bullet holes in the doors, a coffin is delivered and a group of strangers turn up. One has a nervous habit of crossing and uncrossing his fingers - add to the mix a policeman who writes detective stories for a pulp magazine and you have an interesting group of characters. Nothing is done to develop them, the group turn out to be a notorious gang of jewel thieves. Webster masquerades as Bobo Hutch from Pittsburg, to infiltrate the gang - but in the next scene that is forgotten about. The most entertaining part is the man who comes to the door at the end to tell the harassed pair they are at the wrong house!!!!
