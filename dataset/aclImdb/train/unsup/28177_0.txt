Oh My God, I liked this movie soo much! Really, ''South Park:Bigger Longer & Uncut''is hilarious,and only people who doesn't have any sense of humor are not going to appreciate it! The story itself does not have much sense, but who cares? The songs are so funny (specially Terrance and Philiph's one) and we have great scenes, like Saddam Hussein and the Devil fighting because of sexual problems, or all the students who are classmates of Eric, Kyle, Stan and Kenny saying lots, but LOTS of cursed words! Like all South Park's episodes, we have a critic inside the joke: in this movie's case, is to criticize mainly the hypocrite north American society, among other things.
