Read the book! It is so much better. The movie does not even begin to reflect the complexities that Christie contained in her novel. Not to mention, HUGE plot twists are treated in a mundane way and many events are altered, discarded, or invented. Also, the character development in the movie lacks what the novel can provide. In a word, it SUCKS! While I realize that this is a movie website, if you are going to make a movie based on a mystery novel, you should probably at least attempt to maintain the integrity of the original work. Otherwise, just rob the general theme, give the people new names, and pass it off as your own. This movie is the reason why my professors always told me "always read the book, never watch the movie!"
