Complete waste of money and efforts - and everything just for the sake of special effects (which are, actually, very good). The main characters of the great legend look like a bunch of losers and the epic side of the story is obstructed by Merlin's love affair - and, be honest, Sam Neill, though a wonderful actor, is not the right choice for Merlin! Nothing to compare with Boorman's "Excalibur" which I strongly recommend to those who really love Arthurian legends.
