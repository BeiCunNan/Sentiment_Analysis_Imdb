This movie is practically my all time favorite. At least favorite comedy. It is absolutely brilliant, with lovely actors hilarious script, everything really.<br /><br />Jez (Stuart Townsend) is very cute and just incredible. Georgie (Kate Beckinsale) is almost like I would have wanted to be if I could choose.<br /><br />I love this movie so much, and I laughed just as much when I'd seen it three times as after the first.
