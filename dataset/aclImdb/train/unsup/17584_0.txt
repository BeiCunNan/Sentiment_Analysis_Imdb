I always tell people that this is my favorite "sports movie" of all time. Inevitably someone will say something like "but what about a serious sport's movie?" That ticks me off, because this is a serious film. The story centers around a bunch of leftovers from the Little League draft. One of the "rejects" not drafted by a Little League team, has a father who is also a City Councilman, can you say lawsuit? So the League is forced to take all of the kids that nobody wanted and put them on a new team, the Bears. A drunken pool cleaner who used to kick around in the minors is chosen to lead them. Well, the coach and kids soon learn that sports is not that fun when you are the laughingstock of a very competitive league. So, the manager has to start making moves off the field to change the way things are. The movie deals with all kinds of sensitive topics, like elitism, racism, alienation, despair, etc. Yes, I know it is a comedy, but seeing a Coach strike his kid on the mound, seeing players from the rival Yankees degrade the misfit Bears' players, seeing Buttermaker push away one of his players because she wants him to be a father figure, there is real drama at work here. Of course, the revenge angle is at play here as well. Moreover, the actual revenge is quite different than most suspected it would be. Of course, I love the wonderful comedic lines and comedic performances turned in by all. And for my money, there will never be a better closing line in a movie than the one given by Tanner to the Yankees. Walter Matthau and Tatum O'Neal made movie history with this one, a classic movie.
