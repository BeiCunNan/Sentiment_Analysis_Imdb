In 1937 they knew how to make good movies, with story, characterization, et cetera. Indeed, 1937 was the start of Hollywood's true Golden Era, circa 1937-1941. In 2007, most movies don't bother much with silly ideas like plots and story. And in 2007 we ain't got no directors like FRITZ LANG.<br /><br />Henry Fonda knew the secret to getting and keeping a pretty girl: Get thrown in the slammer and when you get out take her to a few good bank robberies. She will love you forever. One of the best parts of this crime drama is the absolute lack of liberal political spin about how "society" supposedly mistreats criminals -- the typical spin of 1970 thru 1980. False, stupid and silly, such pictures "justified" crime and contributed to its increase.<br /><br />This picture was produced by Walter Wanger --- one of Hollywood's greatest independent film producers in the 1930's and 1940's. His studio went belly-up following the personal scandal that wrecked the box office of his big budget JOAN OF ARC. His film library was the very first A-list library to be sold to television. The current DVD has his company eradicated from the credits -- suddenly it's Castle Hill Productions --- but they missed his trademark marble eagle, coming on at the very end.<br /><br />Fritz Lang made better pictures, but this one holds up well after 70 years.
