The worst kinds of films are bad horror films. There are those you can enjoy, and laugh at, and there are those that make you want to gouge your eyes out. Take a good look at my rating and guess which kind this film is.<br /><br />The story? There is none. A killer is on the loose, that's all you need to know. The setting is more important: It's a summer camp, at night, filled with teenagers. Five minutes into the movie the murderer starts to off teenagers and doesn't stop until the end of the film. That's it. No story. No character development. No mystery. Just a bunch of scenes were people die for no apparent reason. It's the kind of film you make with your friends when you're bored.<br /><br />I like slasher films. They're good as no-brainer entertainment. They're never scary, but at least they kill time. This movie doesn't kill time, it kills you're braincells and drains your energy. It's so stupid you wouldn't believe it, and there is noway anyone could ever enjoy this film... Ever.<br /><br />The biggest mistake the director, or writer made, was probably to fill the film with clich√©s. But instead of using different ones, he uses the same one over and over again. A person goes missing. Another person goes to look for him, and is killed. So, another person goes looking and is killed. A third person goes looking, all alone, and not surprisingly, finds himself dead pretty soon. And that's how the film goes. I am not kidding.<br /><br />If you want to look up a good slasherfilm, try to find one that has something that resembles a plot. If you want a bad slasherfilm, don't rent this one. Because this isn't even a film. It's just a montage of people getting killed for no reason at all.
