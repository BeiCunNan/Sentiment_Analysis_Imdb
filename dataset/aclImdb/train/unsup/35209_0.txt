First of all let me say "House Swaping"? Sounds more like an ABC reality show then something that would happen in real life. I mean what kind of cheap Bastard would plan a vacation like that. What was he thinking "It's free". Who is he "Al Bundy"? Next problem, the movie is called TROLL 2, not GOBLINS 1. Where were the Troll? There is no Trolls in Troll 2. No connection to the first movie what so ever. Next major issue, if the "goblins" were vegetarians, then why turn people into vegetables when they can grow their own! It would make more sense if they were flesh eaters. Now finally, the last and biggest problem with "troll 2". The climax, the ending of the film leaves the impression that Josh destroys all the Goblins, then the other shoe drops. He walks into the kitchen and finds Goblins eating his mother after turning her into veggie matter. What the hell is up with that. THE NOOSE
