If this was named something else, there wouldn't be all the outpouring of negativity. This is never going to be as good as the brilliant original.<br /><br />However, it is still a nasty bit of femme fatale noir and thus enjoyable on it's own. The plot is a bit weak in that supposedly Mike from the first movie has a birth father who is some hugely rich tycoon and he is willing to pay any amount of money to get Bridgit to recant that Mike killed her husband and raped her. He is willing to pay the mysterious "Murphy" to illegally find her, drug her and get her back to New York.<br /><br />Bridgit, as usual blows town when the going gets too hot and flees to Spain. She arrives, looks around for someone to have sex with, meets a nasty guy (well he thinks he is - he is actually quite a pawn because he totally underestimates a beautiful woman and how far she is willing to go to get some money, her way, revenge, or just to screw with him because she is bored).<br /><br />Murphy turns out to be a nasty ruthless woman herself and Bridgit finally gets an almost worthy opponent, however, once again she proves she is willing to go to any length to get her way. Even Murphy reveals that she was shocked at what level of amorality and violence she will use to her purposes.<br /><br />Stop whining that this isn't the original and enjoy it for what it is. People can like the Hannibal Lecter character because he is amoral, but if a female does it they are shocked and appalled? Please!
