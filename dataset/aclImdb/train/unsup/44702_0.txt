Lol, please. People... please. If you honestly consider this a good movie, something is sincerely wrong with you. The acting.. the plot.. literally everything in this movie was so utterly horrible. To enjoy this movie you'd have to have an IQ under 40. It was like a neighborhood teen gathering his friends and filming over-dramatic racism. I can't begin to talk about how horrible the acting was. This movie was about as "real and in your face" as a water-pistol.<br /><br />It's not even worthy to be compared to American History X, which was a great movie. Romper Stomper was alright. However I still believe the most insightful, smart, intelligent, powerful Skinhead flick is "The Believer". Which was also a low-budget film, but with a vastly complex story-line and amazing acting-- let alone, actor. Ryan Gosling as the main character Danny Balint in The Believer, I believe, blows all the previously mentioned movies out of the water.<br /><br />Want a good movie? Check out The Believer.
