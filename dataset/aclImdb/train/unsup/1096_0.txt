Jackie Chan plays a role of a twin separated at birth. One grows up as a concert pianist and other a street wise mechanic. Li Chi and Maggie Chuen plays the love interest of both Jackie, and the confusion the two creates with these two women is the comedy of this movie.<br /><br />The good of this movie was Nina Li Chi. She looked great in this movie. One of the best movie she's starred in, and I'm sorry that she didn't star in many more movies like this one.<br /><br />Action scenes are somewhat clich√©, but it was standard for the time this movie was made.<br /><br />I'd like to comment on other parts of this movie, but Li Chi stood out so much in this movie, that I can't think of anything else when I think of this movie.<br /><br />This is a must see movie if you were a fan of Nina Li Chi.
