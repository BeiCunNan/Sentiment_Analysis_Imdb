It wasn't that this movie was particularly bad. I like the pictures, there are characters you can identify it and still: The film is not going anywhere, it's just moving along. It's a series of mini-plots, loosely connected by having the same characters in it. The parts are well made, but the composition is arbitratry in a way that the movie is actually less than the sum of it's parts.<br /><br />The problem is that the protagonists don't have a goal. They are undecided in what they want to do with their lives, and they never actually make that decision and stick by it. That may or may not be an accurate description of real life in the suburbs, but it certainly makes for bad drama: Somebody without a goal can neither succeed nor fail, she's just going nowhere. Everything will just go round in circles, with slight changes from time to time. So what's the point in watching? Nothing will come out of it anyway.<br /><br />So ultimately this movie looks like somebody decided that it might be a cool idea to point a camera at two girls and an older guy and see what happens. After the time is up, still nothing has happened. So we just switch off at that point and call it a movie.
