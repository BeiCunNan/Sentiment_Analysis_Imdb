Starring Lorenzo Lamas, Brenda Strong(Seinfeld's braless wonder) and Frank Vincent, Undercurrent is an intense, sun-splashed, psycho-sexual thriller filled with intrigue and an array of cagey characters. The film has plenty of twists and unexpected scenes. Great locations and cinematogopry capture the fascinating urban locations of historic old San Juan, elegant hotels, palatian homes, picturesque seascapes, and even the cockfight colleseum. This is a change of pace film for Lamas and he carries the role very well.
