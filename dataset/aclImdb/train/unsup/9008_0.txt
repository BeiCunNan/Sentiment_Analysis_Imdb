I saw this movie 2 days ago in a very rainy day. I wanted to escape worries of the day-to-day life, and I gave this movie a shot without really knowing what I should expected from it. And what a surprise! This movie was a great adventure fantasy movie with a good plot, a coherent universe and sweet characters. Probably the movie was targeted principally for kids but as an adult I never got bored a minute. I think that nowadays we do not have enough of these movies that main purpose is to create a viable alternative universe and allow you travel fro a few hours far away from your place. And this one does, so don't hesitate if you tired of watching City of Lost children for the 25th time, or you know all the dialogues of Dark City by heart, a must!
