I gave this movie a two because of the scenery, which is Alcapulco, Mexico and stunning.<br /><br />The cast can't act. In fact, the best acting comes from the native Mexicans cast in this movie of a bride, who wakes up on the day before her wedding to a scuzzy, wealthy guy, to find she's already married some unknown Mexican hottie. In a rather distasteful staged script, the bride, Melissa, went off the rails the day of her last bridal gown fitting because she found her fianc√©, Brian, in bed with her wedding planner. So Melissa went out, drank something that made her blotto, and she woke up married to a stranger.<br /><br />The basic problem, besides the stupidity of the story, is that Laura Prepon, who plays the bride, cannot act. She's very pretty, but there must be more. Her lines are delivered in either low shriek or dumbfounded woodenness. Matt Cedeno, as her surprise husband, is handsome and has a body to drool over, but he's no Benecio Del Toro.<br /><br />To give them credit, they're struggling against a script that is about as bad as the worst of any Harlequin Romance. In fact, this entire movie screams of Harlequin category romances. What ever happened to the snap, crackle, pop of the 1930s and '40s madcap romantic comedies? There is a scene where Melissa and Carlos are chased by the Mexican police. They end up in a swamp filled with alligators. I found myself wishing the reptiles would win.<br /><br />Carrie Fisher plays an overbearing, wisecracking, loud mother-of-the-bride. Sadly, she sounds like a (much) older Princess Lea. I found her scenes with the Mexican hotel staff to be unnecessarily nasty. Yes, she's supposed to be a snob, but you don't have to be a racist snob.<br /><br />There is little to care about in this film. About 12 minutes into it, my eyes glazed over and stayed that way until the end. Anyone who can sit through until the end deserves a medal. Heck, *I* deserve a medal. Ah, well, the search continues for a good romantic comedy made for TV.
