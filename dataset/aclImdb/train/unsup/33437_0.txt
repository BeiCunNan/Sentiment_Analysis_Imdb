Seven years have passed since a sorority sister was killed as a result of a Russian-roulette-type initiation, which was ruled an accident. Then, five members get anonymous invitations to a reunion at a place to which the girls are taken from a central meeting spot by two guys. Although the duo has been paid only to transport the quintet, the pair is with the girls when the fence around the estate closes, locks and electrifies. They learn that their captor is the father of the initiation victim, and the remainder of the movie shows how most of them get knocked off - with a minimum of gore. Although much of the film (especially the first half) is slow-moving, I wasn't discontent at having spent the time to view it. In fact, I watched it a second time, thinking that maybe I missed something as far as the ending was concerned. Did somebody believe that THAT was gonna provide the most compact conclusion? I came away questioning it's logic.
