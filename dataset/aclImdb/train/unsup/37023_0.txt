- Not much to say here, and that's about exactly what this flic deserves. But I wonder what it would've been considered if released back when it was written; Just as poor or rather interesting?<br /><br />Well I'm a movie lover, not a movie reviewer, but I can easily say this was a dog.<br /><br />I bet even John & Janet were rather embarrassed by this one.<br /><br />Still, I watched it and found myself quite taken by Janet Leigh's beauty and enchanting eyes, along with Johnny's youthful amorousity.<br /><br />The plot(?) is a sham, the "Commies" are treated as the usual moron's we were taught to believe them to be in every other propaganda flic, but it still serves to remind us of a time when even seduction was innocently provocative.<br /><br />Return to an earlier time while viewing this comedy-that-never-was, and please don't expect to walk away with a moral, or inspired.<br /><br />It's just a 'cute' way to blow an hour or two, and to remember what Studs Janet and John were in their day.<br /><br />...get the popcorn popping' and leave the Kleenex on the shelf, you won't need it for this one.
