I can understand why some are not satisfied with this film as it is not the typical predictable Bollywood fare, however it is a refreshingly unique piece of Indian cinema. Based upon a 19th century short story by famed Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky; its stunning fantasy visuals provide a perfect setting for the romantic themes.<br /><br />*** SPOILER *** <br /><br />For me, the subtlety of the story revolves around the purity of true love. All of the main characters have an unconditional, unselfish love for another, including the heroine; until the last minute when she loses faith in the promised return of her mysterious hero, but whose fears are unfounded.<br /><br />It can be succinctly summarised in the famous quote by Kahlil Gibran: "If you love somebody, let them go, for if they return, they were always yours. And if they don't, they never were."
