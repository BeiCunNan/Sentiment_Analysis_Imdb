I watched this movie on the Disney channel as a kid and fell in complete love with it then! I watched it every chance I got! I own the movie now as an adult and still adore it! :) I'm a big wolf person so I of course really liked the wolf in the movie! I don't know anyone that wouldn't like this movie! :D
