In the tradition of flicks like Wes Craven's "Shocker" and 2001's "Dark Asylum", "Heartstopper" is a mildly suitable "hospital horror" flick that delivers on the gore but flat-lines on plot (pun rightfully intended!). A notorious killer's death sentence is carried out by means of electrocution, though things don't go entirely according to plan. 'The Chair' takes a little extra juice and the guy doesn't stay dead for long. He becomes inexplicably linked to a suicidal teenage girl whom he goes after, following his resurrection and complete bodily regeneration during his autopsy. He proceeds to rip the hearts out of basically everyone in the hospital while stalking the one girl whose body he wants to inhabit - using his, also unexplained, demonic powers. Yeah, of what little plot there is, the details don't make a whole lot of sense - like the hospital being mostly empty aside from a small group of people and a tornado popping up at the end to ultimately vanquish the "evil"... Robert Englund plays a small but highlighted role as the sheriff who put the psychotic organ-snatcher away and is killed off FAR too soon, while the rest of the cast does nothing but provide clich√©s that move things along until the film's end. All besides the killer, who is actually pretty awesome and highly vicious and quite effective with all of his blasphemous lines. To be honest, the movie was just far too thin on plot, even for a "slasher film" - seeming to somehow waste the majority of it's 92 minute running time with repetitive hallway chases and needless dialog that fails to develop the characters even enough to make you want them to not die AS SOON! The bloodshed amount is hefty, however. People are gutted, burned, gashed and beaten which is a sure "quencher" for gore-hounds. "Heartstopper" has a nice look, but just didn't feel complete...
