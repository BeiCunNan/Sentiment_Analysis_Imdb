This is one of another What a Cartoon short movies that was shown at Cartoon Network.But, unlike Hillbilly Blue and Gramps, this cartoon is really a bad thing. This cartoon tells about a little documentary made by a talking dog saying about his new pathetic life with a bald dumb called Larry.After buying him, Larry goes to a department store in downtown to buy some new furniture.But the old guy makes many stupidities like putting a nuclear globe in a common lamp and then destroying part of the store, or when he puts his dog in a little SPA bed but Larry adjust to a killing(And not relaxing) speed. Afteralls, my vote is simply 1.I can't give 0, and I can't give more than one, because this is a crap!
