Considering this movie is done with a no name cast the acting is top notch. The actors should be given awards for the quality of acting, I did not see any of the stereotypical women panics or war heroes running around with shotguns spouting clich√©s. They picked some quality for the movie and I really hope to see the cast go on to bigger and better things. Considering this movie was low budget the effects, make up and scenes are very well done. The gritty city, the typical way people tune out the warning signs because every day you hear a siren. Where this movie fails is some plot holes and reality checks. While they never develop a background into 3 of the main characters, there are heavy indicators that they share history. It leaves you with the feeling they should have filled us in on the connection. In order to view a horror movie we must be able to turn off that reality check in our mind telling us that this cannot happen. But this movie fails to give the common viewer an explanation for the spread of the infestation. Not a great horror movie but definitely a good one to watch.
