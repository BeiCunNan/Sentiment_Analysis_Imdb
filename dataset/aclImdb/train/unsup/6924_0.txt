She's so lovely as a very talented actress! Travolta with his boring mannerisms don't deserves her love despite two common babies. We're told a story with a love so strong like earthquake, love that did not die even after ten years of separation. High-class acting by Robin Wright Penn, Sean Penn and Harry Dean Stanton. Older daughter is very good too. To Travolta fans: it is NOT HIS film, it IS film about true love between Robin and Sean (like in real life, I hope). A must-see picture (10 out of 10).
