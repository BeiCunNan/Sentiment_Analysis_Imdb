Absolute rubbish-no way does this story connect to anything resembling reality. Its a hotch potch of unfinished ideas and the most absurd plot line imaginable-the patients NOT injected are the ones who end up infected! Suddenly 5 people are shot and killed just like that. At the beginning the patients on the ward are cackling then suddenly they stop. There have been some great movies made with the mental home theme but this isn't one of them. I thought it can't be me-does anyone else understand this junk? Its either too damn clever for its own good -in which case its enough to give your brain a hernia-or perhaps its me who's mental.
