I first saw Quincy just under ten years ago when they showed it on BBC1 in the afternoons. My first memory was of the cops fainting when Quincy shows them the autopsy in the credits. To be honest my favourite character altered between Sam and Astin but I like the cast as a whole, the Danny-Quincy banter (always trying to get that recipe) that dynamic storyline and what have you. I always enjoyed how Quince solved complex cases, although he dealt with the dead it was similar to House or CSI probably more CSI. One episode springs to mind when they search for a boy who's been hidden underground in the desert, they search everywhere and it's by finding a rare flower that starts them off and finding the boy. Quincy dealt with issues as relevant today as they were in the 70's and 80's. Our treatment of people of different race, sex and religion. Quincy was someone who genuinely cared and played excellently by Jack Klugman. <br /><br />Of course, let's not forget that 'funky' soundtrack!
