As a massive fan of the manga i very much looked forward to watching this - i am disappointed. Although some of the themes are still maintained much of the story has been decimated. This isn't the type of story that you can pick and choose what works, it must fit together. Neither Raito or L show any sense of real justice or intellect which are the two characteristics that make their relationship and conflicts so interesting. Raitos cautious nature has been completely ignored with him blatantly bringing out his deathnote in a crowd full of people to write names in it in the very first scene showing him! It does not do justice to the original manga and all i have to say to anyone who is disappointed with the obvious flaws in this - please see the manga for yourself before making judgements on this great story.
