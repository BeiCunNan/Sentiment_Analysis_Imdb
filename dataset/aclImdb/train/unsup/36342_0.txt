OK, I admit that I only made it through the first half hour. After that, i could not take this anymore so I had to shut it off. It was that bad. Bottom line here is that if you want to see bad puns about being an American or Australian in Europe...this is the movie for you. If not, the best thing that you can do is run for cover. I am WAY tired of people making films that bash America and Americans and then send them over here to make money. Also...somebody in this movie should have had her big fat Greek wedding and then hung it up. Hey lady...you are Greek we all know it...and we are over it. Move on! Bottom line for all of you is that this movie is not going to make the grade.
