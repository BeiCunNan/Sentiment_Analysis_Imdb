The lady who plays Lucille Ball did a fine job; the gentleman who plays Desi Arnaz, well ... that's another story. His accent is so grating and so phony that it was laughable. Yet I must ask myself: Why am I even bothering to comment about this movie? What is it about this movie that caught my interest? The answer is this: "I Love Lucy." TV sitcoms come and go and are quickly forgotten. Yet this show, with it s improbable cast of characters, lingers on in the collective memory of American TV memorabilia. A "B" movie actress and her band leader husband become American TV icons. I watched this movie to find out how could this happen. How could these two individuals attain such a high status? There seemed to be absolutely nothing about them that suggested that they would become the most popular and famous TV couple in history. According to the movie, Lucille was vain, insecure, temperamental and at times hysterical while Desi is portrayed as being a shallow, cheating philanderer who is totally dependent on Lucille for financial support. Yet this improbable couple made entertainment history.<br /><br />When will there be a movie about Vivian Vance and William Frawley?
