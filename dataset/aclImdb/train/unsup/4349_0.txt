The original "Out Of Towners" (not the silly remake with Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin) is a underated comedy. Jack Lemmon is brilliant as the stressed Ohio businessman. I don't think any other actor could have reacted or acted as well as Lemmon does. He complains and gripes through the entire movie, yes, but he does it with intensity and not "over the top" histrionics. His complaining and reacting to misfortune is what carries the movie. The alternative would have been not reacting to the changes in plan and just giving up. This couple from Ohio keep trudging along. Most actors would have tried too hard to show the audience how "angry" they were. Lemmon's character takes down names, mutters to himself, and alternates between exasperated expressions and resignation that I found very amusing. I thought they could have found a more attractive actress to play his wife, than Sandy Dennis, but she does play the role well. She does not over react to Lemmon's verbal barrages. They become a likeable pair, and you root for them. Had they become overly aggressive or nasty, they would have lost the comedic touch they maintained. They remained charming with a comedic flair as they traipsed through the streets and subways of New York. It was a great performance by a great actor, Jack Lemmon.
