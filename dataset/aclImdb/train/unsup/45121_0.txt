Simply love films and view them all the time, but I actually found myself going to sleep during all the very slow boring scenes. Despite some so called action scenes on a Battleship and some gals that looked beautiful, but needed to eat a meal once in a while. There is a tragic commercial airline crash with all the elite business brains in the country going to their death. Then we progress forward from one topic to another topic, we see twin guys, a game programmer taken hostage and a big bad old time Battleship put into action by a bunch of nuts. The sailor's on the ship had hats that looked like they all came from Disney Land. I should have continued to fall asleep. Miss this film, don't waste your time, it really is a great film to sleep through.
