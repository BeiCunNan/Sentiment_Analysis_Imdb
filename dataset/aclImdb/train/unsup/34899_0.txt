1. The first disappointment of the movie is too brief to cover the whole story within 116 minutes. It may take two or three chapters, or even an mini-series to cover the cream of the story, like the scientific theory of Quantum roaming, the thrill and suspense. <br /><br />2. The second disappointment is the lousiness of the scene setting, especially the castles. The castle is just like a big house, too small to be a castle standing for battle. <br /><br />3. The third disappointment is the love and romance element too shallow. Unfortunately, it is same as the original novel by Michael Crichton. <br /><br />4. The last disappointment is the characters. The Professor is not portrayed as a wise and calm as the one in the novel. The effect is bad, because the whole team is all the same panicking, without someone wise and calm. The Professor in the original novel is like Gandalf in The Lord of the Ring.
