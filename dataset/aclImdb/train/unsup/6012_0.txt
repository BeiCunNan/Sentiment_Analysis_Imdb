I first saw this Three Stooges short a few months ago, and I really loved it! Like with a lot of other Three Stooges shorts that I have seen, I own this one on DVD as part of the Three Stooges Collection, Vol. 2, and because of that, I can watch this one anytime that I want to see the Three Stooges! <br /><br />I really loved the opening where they got into trouble with their rent and the police, and then they accidentally joined the Foreign Legion, and when the Capitan they were supposed to guard got captured, they then dressed up as Santa Claus in order to go and rescue him! <br /><br />This is their fourth best of 1938, behind "Healthy, Wealthy, and Dumb," "Tassels in the Air," and "Violent Is the Word For Curly!" I really think that you should see this riot! You will want to watch this short over and over again, as with a lot of the Three Stooges shorts out there! <br /><br />This is one of their best out of their early years, but some of their best are "Punch Drunks," "Men in Black","Violent Is the Word For Curly," and "A Plumbing We Will Go." You really should see this short! You will really be laughing and laughing at it! <br /><br />10/10
