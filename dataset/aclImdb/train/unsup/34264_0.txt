I don't know what so many people saw in this movie, I thought it was very boring. There was not much going on, Nicole Kidman looked like she was simply going for a paycheck here. If you are looking for a real suspenseful movie, this isn't it. Save your money and rent something worthwhile. 1 out of 10.
