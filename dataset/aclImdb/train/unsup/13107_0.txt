I made an awful mistake. I thought that because Greer Garson was such a great actress, all of her films had to be just as great. Oh, what a fool I was! I was so disappointed with this film. I'd purchased several of Ms. Garson's films at one time and settled in this past weekend for a Greer Garson film festival. "That Forsyte Woman" was the third film watched and I found myself wiggling and blowing from boredom. Mr. Flynn was a handsome diversion, but Greer's love interest, Robert Young, just didn't fit the bill. The story was just all together weak. There were some decent performances, but the story lacked and lacked a lot. As a matter of fact, I was waiting for the thick of the plot and the credits started to roll. How infuriating!!! I'm very proud of my library of movies and I rarely take away from them, but I'm almost embarrassed to have this one on display. I'd steer clear of this one.
