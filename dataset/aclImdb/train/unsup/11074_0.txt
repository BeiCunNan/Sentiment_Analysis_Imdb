I will be frank: if Susan Sarandon had not been in this movie, I would not have watched. I will happily watch almost anything she appears in. James Spader's acting ability is marginal at best, but here, he does a very effective and surprisingly understated job and he and Sarandon do make sparks (although Sarandon could make sparks all alone in a full-force hurricane!) as a couple in this. Very good romantic drama, despite the occasional mis-step. Recommended.<br /><br />
