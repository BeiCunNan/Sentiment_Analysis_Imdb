The relatively bad rating didn't stop me from watching this movie. I like sci-fi movies and time travelling is also compelling! As many people have stated here, the movie was off to a good start and all was well. However, this ended when with the spinning camera scene inside the bank. Totally ridiculous and uncalled for.<br /><br />After that the story never really evolved and instead all we saw was a bad action movie without a shred of tension... I agree - they totally wasted a good idea for a movie! As one guy said before me, I too would like to travel back to before I watched this movie.<br /><br />There are a lot of good comments about this movie, most of which are suspiciously positive about things in this movie that there really cannot be any discussion about whether they're good or not... I believe these people are giving us their subjective thoughts derived from their involvement in this project and therefore they are not to be trusted.<br /><br />If you're interested in irritating flaws in this movie, you should read some of the other negative reviews really. It's all been said before. However, there is one thing I was wondering about. I'm far from an airplane expert, but would a plane really crash if someone fired a shout through one of the windows? Sure, it might be a bit windy in the cabin, but even that shouldn't be a problem due to the low altitude at which they were flying at the time. No air masks would be necessary anyway. As I said, i'm no expert, but this just seems wrong.<br /><br />Finally, I'd just like to say that when Astin's character managed to drop the time travel PDA thingumajig for like the eleventh time, I really started to hate him...<br /><br />3/10
