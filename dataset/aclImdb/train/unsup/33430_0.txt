Seven years after a pledge is tragically killed in a sorority initiation rite, five of the other sisters are invited to a remote mansion (modern style, not Gothic) where they face a fight for their lives, "aided" by two horny young men who are trapped with them. Why are they being killed and who is (are) the killer(s)? Such is the premise of this fairly entertaining "B" horror/mystery movie. <br /><br />The acting is about par for this kind of movie and though it is clearly a product of the seventies, it doesn't seem too dated. The story is a fairly straightforward and predictable one up until a very strange ending that just doesn't make a lot of sense to me. However, there are some creative set ups to kills, and the film works fairly well even without gore or nudity, and little suspense. I think this is partly because the pacing is good and doesn't allow it to get too boring.<br /><br />Not the greatest movie, but if you like "B" movies, then this one is surprisingly entertaining.
