A meteor falls in the farm of the religious man Nathan Hayes (Claude Akins). The local Dr. Alan Forbes (Cooper Huckabee) decides to call the appropriate authorities to investigate it. However, he is convinced by a speculator, who wishes to buy the lands, and by his sexy wife Esther Forbes (Hope North), who wants to move from that place, to analyze the meteor by himself. A dam will be built In this place and the value of the lands will increase, and Esther will receive an extra bonus from the speculator, if the Hayes sell their lands. Meanwhile, the meteor releases a strange substance in the water table, contaminating the water of Hayes` farm. The young Zachary Hayes (Wil Wheaton) notes that something weird is happening with his mother, but Nathan disregard his observation. Zachary`s family is affected by the water. This movie is a trash C-movie. I bought the VHS just because of Wil Wheaton, from Star Trek, but it is only indicated to fans of trash-movies. The special effects are very poor. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): `A Maldição , Raízes do Terror' (`The Curse, Roots of Terror')
