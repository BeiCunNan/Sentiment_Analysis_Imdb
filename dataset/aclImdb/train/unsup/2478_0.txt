"Official Denial" easily overcomes it's budget constrained special effects with a fast moving, highly intelligent script. The film covers a lot of scientific speculation regarding U.F.O.s, alien cover ups, and alien abductions. Because interest is generated by what's being said, rather than what's being seen, the low grade visuals are not a problem at all. The entire production is very positive, and acted with enthusiasm not seen in many "blockbuster" movies. Overall a very entertaining and thought provoking film, that will reward multiple viewings. I highly recommend "Official Denial". The VHS is not easy to find, but well worth seeking out. - MERK
