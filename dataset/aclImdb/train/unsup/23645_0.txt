This Tod Browning masterpiece stars Lon Chaney as an armless knife thrower in love with circus owner's daughter Joan Crawford. This being Chaney, you know he'll stop at NOTHING to get what he wants. A creepy, haunting movie with in your face horror that never lets up. Chaney is brilliant and Crawford is fine as the man-fearing gypsy girl. There's an overall sense of dread that's sustained throughout. With Norman Kerry as Malabar, the lovelorn strongman and Chaney's rival for Crawford's affections. John George is Chaney's dwarf sidekick who may or may not be the Devil himself. The moody cinematography is by Merritt Gerstad, who went on to photograph a wide variety of movies (from A NIGHT AT THE OPERA to WATCH ON THE RHINE).<br /><br />A brilliant, ironic precursor to Browning's more famous FREAKS.
