Brian DePalma's follow up to his popular "Carrie", was in many aspects a continuation of the mood he had already established in his former work. Thus, "The Fury" suffered because it was not an inspired choice for a man who knew better, but for whatever circumstances decided to go ahead with this project. The film is based on a novel by John Farris, which we never read, so there is no point of reference. Mr. Farris also wrote the screen treatment.<br /><br />This ambitious film travels from the Middle East to Chicago in a tale of intrigue and super natural forces that is incomprehensible, at times. The idea of having a gifted young man working for the bad guys and capitalizing on all that can be extracted from his prodigious mind, is a disturbing idea. That there could be another brilliant mind, a young woman, presents a challenge for the evil people that are trying to use them for evil purposes.<br /><br />The director was not as lucky with "The Fury" as with some of his best known, and more accomplished films. Amy Irving plays the young Gillian, who is terrified once she understands why she is so much wanted. In a way, she is an extension of Carrie, the heroine of the previous film. Kirk Douglas has some good moments. Carrie Snodgress was one of the best things in the movie. Charles Durning, Carol Rossen, and Fiona Lewis, do outstanding work. On the other hand, the great actor/director John Cassavetes seems to sleep walk through his role as the man behind the conspiracy. Darryl Hannah is seen briefly in the scene at Gillian's school.<br /><br />The film has an effective musical score from John Williams. Although the director didn't succeed in making this a better movie, he still shows an affinity for the genre and cannot be dismissed for trying to create a good entertainment.
