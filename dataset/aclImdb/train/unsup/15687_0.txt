Dudes, Polkaroo rocks. Who are the losers who gave it a 4? For shame! Polkaroo is a cultural icon for an entire generation of Canadians, some Americans, and even some Irish! Why, my brother once used Polkaroo as his ICQ nickname for crying out loud. Man, I can't believe that The Polkadot Door got canceled. Polkaroo, Goldilocks, Bear... Man, those were the days. The Polkadot door is what made me the man I am today. Without those cherished memories of Polkaroo's innocent, happy, na√Øve voice happily chanting his name, I think my scarred childhood would have been unbearable. I can honestly say without the least bit of exaggeration that THE POLKAROO SAVED MY LIFE. He is a celebrity... an icon... nay, dare I say, a NATIONAL HERO. <br /><br />ALL HAIL POLKAROO! LONG LIVE POLKAROO!! In the immortal words of the master himself: "POLKAROO! POLKAROO!"<br /><br />Regards, David
