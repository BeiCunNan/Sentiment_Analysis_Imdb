I knew nothing about this film when I watched it on Sundance Channel the other day. So I was able to let it "hit me" with no preconceived ideas. If you haven't watched it yet, please do so before reading anything else.<br /><br />Now, in general: Great acting, very realistic feel, and the children were amazing. It felt unscripted whenever they were on screen, their characters and personalities seemed so realistic! And all the adults were also very human and real.<br /><br />The ending: I've had to ponder this a lot, and someone else's comment helped me sort through it. It doesn't end neatly with all the loose ends tied up--like real life, with choices bringing effects and consequences. I was shocked at first how Alexei just disappeared at the hospital after discovering his powers were gone. I agree with someone who said that his passions must have been diverted away from healing when he set them on Julie instead, and I was not surprised when this happened. In fact, as they were pursuing their romance, I suspected he was making a choice whether he realized it or not, and he said he didn't want to do the healing anymore and wanted to be with her, so maybe he did know. He was human after all, facing and giving in to human nature temptations of lust and desire for romance and relationship. I admit I feel some worry about him, what would have happened to him. But then the end of the movie comes suddenly, with time having passed, Julie growing large with Alexei's baby, and everyone seeming to be at peace with life at that point. That is what was so thought-provoking after the movie ended. Bottom line, we live in the here and now, making the best of bad or less-than-ideal life circumstances, and that is where this family seemed to land. But I still worry about what happened to Alexei!
