It's got to be a warning when the big marquee names are ex reality TV contestants and comedians who wonder what happened to their once-thriving careers. This group of cardboard cut-out non-entities are perhaps the main flaw in a deeply flawed movie. Imagine how this puerile rubbish was pitched: "Hey there's this guy, right, and he loses his wee-wee, and gets a new one... and then we can do these jokes about Viagra and 69s and poo and farts and other stuff that we came up with after six beers and a whole stack of old comedy tapes. Yay, we got a winner!" Since they've used every other tacky gimmick, how about issuing the audience with 1D glasses to see the characters in all their glory? With characters as feeble as these, the movie can at least be saved by some great jokes. Which makes it more of a shame that there aren't any.
