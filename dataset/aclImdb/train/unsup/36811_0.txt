I guess being from England and having been reading about Jack the Ripper for 12 years from books to movies I finally saw the right movie here in Denmark a few years ago where everything seemed to make sense and it was the mini series with Michael Caine. So my friends and I had to choose between Shallow Hal and From Hell. We figured From Hell would be good since we all were familiar with the story so there wouldn't be any surprises. 27 minutes of the movie and we are in total suspense and something happened and they had to restart the movie once again! So again we sat back and waited for that moment to come again and we figured wow if it was so interesting for the first Â½ hour it would no doubt be even better later on! WE WERE WRONG!!! The entire movie suddenly fell out of place and entered a whole other dimension where fact and fiction had to be divided and after dividing it the whole movie became fiction. If they had to base a film on something like that they shouldn't have made a Jack the Ripper film it was almost an insult to what Michael Caine had preformed so perfectly as Abberline. Johnny Depp's accent couldn't be anymore silly than it was even though I would give him a little happy by saying nice try there. The real Inspector Abberline was in his late 40's, did Johnny even look past 30? This movie will get a 2 out of 10 and only because the whole setting was terrific and even the special effects with the knife, good! Other than that don't bother it unless you have some extra cash in your pockets and nothing else to do.
