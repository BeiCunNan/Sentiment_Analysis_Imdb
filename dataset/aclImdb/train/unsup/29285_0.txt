A Miami Tail is a clever take on the old Lysistrata story. I read Lysistrata in high school and was surprised at how well the filmmakers stayed true to the story. I especially like the way the actors addressed the camera ... it was just like the Greek chorus. Trina's performance wasn't bad for her first movie. No worse than other rappers or singers the first time out. Sommore was excellent. Other standouts included Benji Brown. That guy is very funny. Mr. Cheeks is only in the movie briefly, but memorably. The music in the movie is pretty cool too. Must admit that I have never seen so many beautiful women in one movie. The movie won't win any Oscars, but for a low-budget indie, I think the movie is excellent and definitely worth checking out.
