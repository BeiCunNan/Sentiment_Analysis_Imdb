A simple and sad story told in a beautiful picture, but what makes the film really interesting is the context of it, the dramatic reality of a reli-fascistic society in which women mean nothing that is outlined to us. A reality that fortunately doesn't exist anymore in the same way in Afghanistan, but in various forms is still practiced in a number of countries. The actors are all non-profi's and they play wonderful. The only optimistic thing you can say about the film is that the girl playing the leading part (who was a beggar) could buy a simple house for her and her family after having played in the film.
