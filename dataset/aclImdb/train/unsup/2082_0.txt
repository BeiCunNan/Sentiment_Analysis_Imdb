Set in the Depression Era rural South, 2 men, George (smart but not strong) and Lenny (strong but not smart) are searching the countryside for their dream: a little farm that will support them and bring them happiness. They find work as farm hands but encounter prejudice (Lenny is considered a "dummy") and cruelty by a sadistic boss. When Lenny accidentally kills the boss's beautiful wife, George tells the upset Lenny that everything will be OK, to quickly go to their "secret place". The ending is heartbreaking.<br /><br />After reading "Of Mice And Men" one wonders about WHY people see the need to look down on less fortunate ones, even tormenting them for "not fitting in". In reality it is the bullies who are the misfits. Starved for attention and the need for superiority destroys their human features and makes them more like animals. This book tells us to expel hate from our hearts. I recommend this book to students age 14 and up.<br /><br />This book can be turned into a wonderful stage play, requiring minimal sets. There is also a vintage movie version which I can recommend. As always, the book is the best of all "media". Highly recommended.
