It could have been an interesting premise. But it was executed so horribly, I was just in awe of what a mess this all turned into. For me, the only reason to watch this film is to see Ryan Carnes for the bulk of 90 minutes. He is completely engaging and could probably have turned in a better performance had he been given a decent script and an experienced director. He is impossibly gorgeous and, as a straight actor, does a really good job of believably portraying a gay guy, without resorting to overacting or being stereotypically gay.<br /><br />Jim Verraros, in his role as Kyle, is really pretty cute in his own right, except he curls his lips and bobbles his head around in a sneering, dismissive way almost whenever he talks and it's really unflattering and conveys completely the wrong message relative to what he's actually saying. In spite of being cute and all, though, the character of Kyle is utterly self-loathing and just a miserable, bitchy queen. He was also campy to the point of distraction, but again, I blame that on the screenplay. Verraros is no amazing actor, but I believe he could pull off an indie role reasonably well if given better tools.<br /><br />Apart from having a nice upper body, I did not see the appeal of Caleb (played by Scott Lunsford). He reminded me far too much of "Ted" from Queer As Folk.<br /><br />As for the rather abrupt ending, I find it a bit of a stretch that the geeky self-hating boy would, after one horrible dinner in which he basically pouted the whole time, land the ferociously hot, model-esquire party boy Marc, who apparently instantly forgets all about his major crush on Caleb and acts as though he's been pining away for Kyle all this time. But it had to be a dream for Jim Verraros... an openly gay guy getting to totally make out with a gorgeous straight guy in a movie.<br /><br />The DVD itself was abysmal. There are only 4 chapter marks, which is ridiculous for any movie, the subtitles are utterly horrible (they're wrong half the time, omit words, misspell words, etc.), and the commentary is among the worst I've ever been subjected to -- I couldn't sit through more than about five cumulative minutes of it. (I jumped around to see if it ever improved.) Basically, it was five people sitting in an echo chamber of a room with what was clearly one cheap microphone in the middle of the room, all talking about whatever pops into their heads. Half the time it wasn't about the movie at all.<br /><br />The DVD I got from Netflix was obviously edited, as there was no actual nudity in it whatsoever. So clearly there are at least two versions of this DVD out there, which is really just pretty crappy.<br /><br />The cinematography is decent for the most part, but another person on here said it looked like a lot of the scenes were filmed by a security camera and I agree. Wide-angle lenses have their time and place, but they're sorely misused and overused in this movie. It results in some very weird scenes that you feel like you're watching from afar... definitely doesn't help draw you into the movie, and the inane dialogue certainly doesn't compel you to be drawn into the characters, either.<br /><br />All in all, it's not an absolutely horrible movie, but it's sure not very good, and I couldn't recommend it without some serious caveats. I'm not sure I understand the shirtless makeout scene between Kyle and Marc after the credits roll, either. It just doesn't make any sense in the storyline and seems to have been added on for prurient reasons (in which case, it could have been much steamier). Moreover, the picture just freezes at a random point, while the counter keeps running, then the disc ends (cuts off, rather) a minute or so later. It's very amateurish, and sadly, fits in nicely with virtually every other technical aspect of the DVD.
