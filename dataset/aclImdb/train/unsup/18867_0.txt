One thing, i'm sure about, that there was another policeman who didn't die yet, (the one with the white barb). But why he doesn't worried about his partners (or his friend/ father of the victim) who obviously never showed up again ???? Or maybe looking for a help ??? (I always hopping that in the middle of the film, there were a S.W.A.T team who came from no where) I always like a horror/gore movies, but i like betters ones with some logic behind it. I think Rob Zombie miss about this one. We can only suppose that, Mr Policeman is a member of this freak family, or he doesn't really care about his partners, or maybe he's got sick and die ...<br /><br />Rob Zombie shame on you :p
