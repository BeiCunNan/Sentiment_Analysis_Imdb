Starcraft is undoubtedly the most popular Real-Time Strategy (RTS) of all time, with the possible exception of Age of Empires. It follows the time tested RTS pattern: harvest resources with "villagers," upgrade your production and military units with a "blacksmith" structure, build up an army and go trounce all opposition. That's RTS in a nutshell.<br /><br />Starcraft was above all an outstanding single player experience. The storyline was excellent, with fantastic cut-scenes and top quality acting. It placed the gamer right in the thick of the plot, starting with peripheral missions and leading to a crucial role in the struggle at hand. Each race was unique, with completely different units and play styles. Herein was perhaps Starcraft's greatest strength. So many RTS games have either identical units or a very close facsimile thereof.<br /><br />Although fun, Starcraft did not necessarily bring anything new to the table. The terrain was rendered in 2D, the resource system identical to Warcraft and Age of Empires, and otherwise felt in many ways similar to other contemporary RTS games. I also didn't feel that the game was as good of a multiplayer experience, lessening it's replayablity. There were a limited number of strategies and tactics to employ with the units available.<br /><br />Although I got my money's worth out of the title, I did not feel it was groundbreaking, nor did it deserve the popularity it enjoyed. There are many superior RTS games, but one certainly would not guess that judging from it's sales. It's appeal is wide and any RTS fan, or beginner, will be pleased.
