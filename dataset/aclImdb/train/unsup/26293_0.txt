After having seen films like Bend It Like Beckham, Bollywood/Hollywood, American Desi seemed like familiar territory but nevertheless a very one. For those who think the film is cliched, they didn't get it. Because it is meant to give those cliches a humorous look. The humor in the film is very well done. Instead of having an offensive or critical view of anything in particular, the film takes more of a funny spin on things. There are oddities and stereotypes in every culture; the film tries to give the american and desi cultures a bit of a homage, with a chuckle of course. 8/10.
