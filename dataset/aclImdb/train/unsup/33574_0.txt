Javed Jaffry is great in this movie . A genuine classic comedy character up there with Sholay's Soorma Bhopali or Padosan's Masterji. Unfortunately , he can't live the movie enough to make me give it anything more than 1 point . For Javed's 15 minutes of screen-presence , I had to go thru' Preity Zinta's 2 hours.<br /><br />How dumb can a Hindi movie be , when 3 people are sitting on a table and two are talking in Hindi , when the third one butts in and says 'English , Please' ?!! And why in the name of God , does this movie have to be based in Australia ? Is it to prove the Australia doesn't make good contraceptives ? ( By the way , the movie is about a contraceptive gone wrong ) The first half had some light watchable and listenable moments , but the second half was Ufff .... TOO MUCH SHREIKING for my pleasure . Abhishekh Bacchan enters supposed as a likable bumbling doctor. But he doesn't look like any doctor . He just looks like Abhishekh Bacchan with bad makeup and horrible overacting , possibly as a result of some contract gone wrong with the producer.<br /><br />Overall , a bad movie . Worth watching on pirated DVD's just for Javed JAffry.
