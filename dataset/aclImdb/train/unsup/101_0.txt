I saw this a couple of times in the late seventies. My parents had just subscribed to this new service called Cable TV, and low and behold we had a movie channel called Showtime. I watched it every day it was on. It gives new meaning to the word "Putz". I really wish it would be released on video/DVD. I don't understand why it hasn't been. It is sad that another generation hasn't had the opportunity to share the laughs.
