I sneaked into this R rated film when I was 13 thinking this film was something it was not. However I was rewarded with a truly funny film! At that time I got most of the jokes. In all that year I probably saw the film 10 times. We had a book of passes to the theater and were such fixtures we could get into any film, sans parent.<br /><br />I just watched it again on Encore. This was the first time I have seen it since I was 13 and I am amazed at how well the film still holds up. It was also amazing to see the amount of talent Allen had to work with in the film. Such as Burt Reynolds, John Carridadine, Gene Wilder, Tony Randall and the always great Louise Lasser. You can also see how some of the skits inspired Saturday Night Live which was to come years later.<br /><br />If you watch the film, and you should, you will be amazed at the look of the film. It looks as thought it was made much later than 72 but I guess Allen was ahead of his time. It may also amaze some people that Allen was actually funny at one time. With this film coming at the time of Bananas and Sleeper one could not ask for a better time for Allen to make this film. It also makes you think about Allen and his foster step daughter in the context of this film. <br /><br />Do yourself a favor and rent Bananas, Sleeper and this film. Catch Woody when he was funny. His one liners in this film are worth the rental price alone.
