This is, quite possibly, my all time favorite cartoon. My friend Camille and I have been quoting it for years, just from memories of childhood. Not long ago, I ran across it on VEOH(much like you tube). It was great to see it again after 25 plus years. The title song RULES!! If you like the old cartoons, as I do, you will love this one. Also, I just learned that the voice of Owl Jolson was provided by Tommy Bond at the age of nine. Most would know him as Butch, the bully from the "Our Gang" series. The just of the episode is an owl born to sing jazz music, which drives his dad crazy, and his path to acceptance from his entire family. Do yourself a favor and give it a watch. You won't be disappointed.
