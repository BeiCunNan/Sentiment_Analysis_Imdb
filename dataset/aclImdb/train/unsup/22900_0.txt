Drivers Wanted is absolutely hilarious! I don't think I laughed that much all summer... definitely on my top 10 list of funniest movies ever. It had a type of brutal honesty (quite charming in and of itself) and real-life quality that is, sadly, only found in independent films these days. Its independent nature allowed it to get its message across without being weighted down with a large studio's insistence of mainstreaming it. It was very well thought out, and overall, creatively original - it has it's own spark that screams unique. In any event, we took my friend's father, (a cardiac surgeon in the area) to see it, and he was so inspired by the film that he now delivers pizzas part-time on his moped in addition to his surgeon gig. (no lie) Proof of pizza power!
