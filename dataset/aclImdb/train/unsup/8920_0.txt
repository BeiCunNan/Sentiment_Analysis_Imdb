I'm not gonna spoil it for you guys in case you wanna see it but this movie is not even a low budget movie, its like some kid used his phone camera to shoot the whole movie. The actors are really bad and so is the CGI. The directing is quit poor as well as it tends to jump from one part to another leaving the audience unsure about what is happening while the funny exaggerations of actor's powers are quit overwhelming. an example is that apparently you can smash the brain of the zombies or so called 'RAT people by normal punching. I saw this movie in hopes of having a great Zombie memory but I was very disappointed as there was not storyline just a concept that was repeating it self while the rest of the movie acting, directing, CGI and etc were very poor.<br /><br />I would recommend spending your time on some other movies such as Dawn of the dead 2004 remake or something like that rather than this movie.
