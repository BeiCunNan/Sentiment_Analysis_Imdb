I didn't know this film-maker, Reygadas promises much to me now. I'm looking for Japon now. But.. why I love this? To be short, to me is a total, human, deep film. Simple... and this is a quality, a great one in this case. Beautiful photography and music, very good actors. Maybe is only a 9 film... I need other plays, maybe in original language if I find it, seems that in my idiom (Italian) it less many. In doubt I give it maximum vote I can, it is one of the rare work that catch me totally e in my deepest sensations and emotions. Also the famous "scandalous" scenes are very sweet, kindly, true... most true that in hollywoodian rappresentations. But who is that find fellatio scandalous in 2006 AD?? or in generally making love? war, hypocrisy, loneliness are the real scandal of humanity... like seeing in this beautiful film work. <br /><br />and a nice little thing: Anapola is a portrait of female beauty and energy , I knew her in Hate 2 O, another beautiful imaginative film, by Italian film-maker Infascelli.
