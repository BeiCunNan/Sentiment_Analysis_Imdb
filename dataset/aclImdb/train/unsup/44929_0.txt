having been somewhat looking forward to this movie, more because of the titillating title than anything else, i finally got round to seeing it. I have to say this movie is probably the biggest missed opportunity of the year. A interesting set-up/premise, competently directed but completely let down by a real clunker of a script. It's nearly half an hour before anything remotely happens, which wouldn't be so bad if we were getting to know the characters, some back story etc, but nothing. Each character is a complete no entity, bland, two dimensional, each spurting flat dialogue which you can almost imagine them reading from the page.<br /><br />The only character who has any back story is Tammi, who's broken up with the boyfriend who cheated on her, therefore we're supposed to care about her; and because she's the only one who protests, momentarily, joining the guys on the boat, we know she's the one who will be the 'last man standing'. The blond, sexually adventurous one, you know straight away is the one who is going to 'get' it...and, ho hum, she is. Could this film be any more predictable. <br /><br />After the 'incident' everything becomes totally unrealistic and over the top. The writing is just so bad. One moment Tammi pulls a knife on the guys but then is disarmed. Then while the guys are trying the sink the body they leave the girls free to get away. They don't go back to the knives which they know are there instead they run inside the boat, find a hatch and climb back outside again. I could go on but i really can't be arsed. The only thing i liked about the movie was the poster.
