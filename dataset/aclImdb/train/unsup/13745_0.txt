Hands down, this is my favorite concert DVD out of the many I have watched. I would say the best, but "best" is such a subjective term. This features, of course, David Coverdale as a prime example of sounding at least as good as he ever has, and quite possibly better. As for the rest of Whitesnake, I don't think he has ever assembled a better supporting cast. It has been previously been noted, quite accurately, that Doug Aldrich is given the lion's share of solos in this lineup. But Reb Beach definitely has his moments, and his brilliance does shine through more than once. Tommy Aldridge is a king in my book. What a drummer! I also think Marco Mendoza is the absolute best bass player around, at least in the style of bass he plays. I give this a 10 out of 10.<br /><br />However if it were possible I would deduct about 3/10 for the omission of 2 songs. I can't begin to understand why "Slow N' Easy' and "Slide It In" were left off of this. Truth be told, I could go the rest of my life without ever hearing "Bad Boys" again. The same can be said for "Take Me With You", although they worked that one up really well. But if you take those two away, you definitely have room for two more songs that I find indispensable. Yet these glaring omissions can't take away how marvelous this performance was. As a bonus, when you purchase this DVD, you get a bonus CD with about half of the show on it. I don't possess the words to describe how much i recommend this. I give this a 9.7 GOD bless David Coverdale!!!!
