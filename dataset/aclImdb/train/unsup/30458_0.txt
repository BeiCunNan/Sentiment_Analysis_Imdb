This little gem opens in 1987, where two people are killed and dragged off-screen by an aquanoid. Cut to around 2003-ish, where we meet are heroin Vanessa, daughter of one of said killed persons from 1987, who's convinced aquanoids are still out there.<br /><br />Of course a new rash of killings begin, but its tourist season and two goofy-looking old guys decide not to let panic spread, so they decide to silence Vanessa. Of course, their plan fails.<br /><br />In the mean time, there's a ghastly mortician who likes to dissect things (While eating his lunch) who confirms that the mutilated bodies are indeed the work of an aquanoid. The two goofy-looking old guys cover it up by saying it was the work of a boating accident (We know this because one of the said goofy-looking old guys goes up to the mortician and says to his face; "BOATING ACCIDENT!").<br /><br />Vanessa and friends try to warn people of the imminent threat, but everyone thinks she's a nut job and completely ignores her warnings.<br /><br />Any ways, a group of kids go off and get killed, one gets impregnated and later in the mortician's office gives birth (Apparently in addition to having a mortician's license, he's also qualified to deliver a baby) to a monster that looks like a cross between the Fiji Mermaid and a carrot. <br /><br />The fiji-carrot thing gets dispatched of and the mortician is forced at gunpoint to tell a police officer what the hell's going on. Mortician tells him all, gets knocked out, police officer leaves, enter the two goofy-looking old guys. The girl who gave birth to the aquanoid is the daughter of one of the said goofy old guys, he's naturally disgruntled and the ghastly mortician once again gets interrogated at gunpoint. This time the mortician introduces the deceased baby fiji-carrot to them, saying; "Meet your new grandson!!!".<br /><br />Mortician gets dispatched of via bullet to the brain, the two goofy old guys leave and have a shoot out with a cop (During an incredibly exciting split-screen action scene). One of said goofy old guys is killed, as is the police officer, leaving one goofy old guy to stop Vanessa.<br /><br />Vanessa and friends go to the beach to kill the aquanoid (Apperantly there's only one), armed with all sorts of illegal weapons, go diving for said aquanoid, think they have it trapped and try to blow it up, resulting in an impressive CG explosion. Well, it's not dead, almost kills one of the said friends-of-Vanessa, gets blown up again, this time for good. <br /><br />HOWEVER, the one remaining goofy old guy is still out to get Vanessa, tries to shoot her with a sniper rifle, but gets dispatched of via harpoon-to-the-face by a police officer.<br /><br />The end.<br /><br />Wow. I thought I'd seen it all, until I saw Aquanoids. Everything about this film is top-notch, from the polished cinematography to the stunning camera work to the grade-A performances. The scene where Vanessa's friend admits he's her father was incredibly touching and powerful. It's a scene that will go down in film history for sure. The special effects were simply stunning. The cmaera work, well, is the most visually impressive I've ever seen, frankly. <br /><br />The screenplay is intelligent and thought-provoking and the direction is both awe-inspiring and mesmerizing. A great movie, and if you liked this I also recommend films like "Rodentz", "Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys" and "The Creeping Terror", which are also flawlessly excellent cinematic masterpieces.<br /><br />This film has truly changed my life, it's the most thought-provoking and emotionally devastating epic of the last century. It made me rethink my life, question who I am and what is real, and it will do the same for you.<br /><br />10/10
