I bought this movie when it 1st became available (to the tune of ~$65) because I was there for some of the shooting and my car was in the movie. What a complete and total waste of money! This movie was AWFUL! Boring, slow, terrible story line...I'm not sure what movie the other people that reviewed this actually watched, but it couldn't have been this one. I'm not really sure what else I can say about this movie other than I wish I could recover the the time in my life that I wasted in watching this horrible movie. After my wife tortured herself by watching the entire movie, I literally fast forwarded through the it until I saw my car and then shut it off...it was that bad. I can't believe this won any kind of award. It must be only for the fact that he made the movie. I have nothing against Larry. I met him and he was a very nice, personable guy. But IMHO, this movie just does not cut it.
