About two months ago my friends and I rented this movie and we only watched the first 5 minutes of it because we got bored so we took it out and watched another movie. Once they left I decided to watch it by myself since I spent 5 dollars on renting it. I wish my friends and I watched the whole thing because it's one of the best movies ever made and I was smiling through the whole movie. I'm not really a big fan of Matthew but I thought he did an awesome job on here. I really think this movie should of won an Oscar because it was just amazing.. <br /><br />10/10 [: <br /><br />GO SEE IT NOW.
