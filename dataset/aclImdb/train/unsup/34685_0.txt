If you like this show, you are probably not going to like what I'm going to say. Then again if you like this show, I can't say I have really any sympathy for you.<br /><br />Frankly, this has got to be the most painful TV show I have seen in ages. No wit, no purpose, no talent whatsoever. I scrolled down the "memorable quotes" to see if I was just unlucky with the bits and pieces I could stand to watch. No. I have not found one quote that brought a smile on my face, let alone one that actually made me laugh.<br /><br />And another thing, I find it depressing that in this day and age they still try to use the laugh track as a cue to where the "funny stuff" is supposed to be. I have never met anybody who did not find the laugh track completely annoying, and this show has one of the LOUDEST laugh tracks I have ever heard! But of course when all you have is this kind of drivel, that's the only thing you can resort to to pretend what you're showing is actually funny.<br /><br />Where I live they show this after the excellent "Scrubs". The difference in quality is amazing. Where "Scrubs" is always fresh, witty and honest, "Less than Perfect" is stale, moronic and, well... unwatchable.
