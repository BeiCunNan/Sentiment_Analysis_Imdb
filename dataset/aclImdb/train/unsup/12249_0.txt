This film gave me a sense of how Jerry Bruckheimer started out. "The Incorporated" is a very strong first endeavor. Knowing the extreme difficulties of getting a film off the ground, let alone finishing with polished precision, I applaud Kenneth Guertin. All of the elements of an action-thriller were in place. I look forward to him and his team's future work. Independent film-makers like Kenneth Guertin are the type of artist who develop into the Steven Spielbergs and James Camerons of the "Hollywood Machine". I would like to see more Independent action-based films like "The Incorporated", rather than those we see every year at the festivals striving to be the next Neil LaBute or Woody Allen.
