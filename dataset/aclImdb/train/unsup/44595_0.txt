This was intended to be a serious movie which came out at the same time as the big budget remake of KING KONG. I remember as a kid, reading the poster in line at the theater which stated "not to be confused with King Kong", which is hilarious in itself. I ended up walking out (after the dumb guy in the ape suit wrestles the plastic shark in the pool scene) near the beginning and got a refund.<br /><br />If they spent more than $50.00 to make this movie, they were fools.<br /><br />You will be too if you watch this piece of crap.<br /><br />
