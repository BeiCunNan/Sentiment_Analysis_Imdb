Although the romantic, suave and serene Rajesh Khanna has other big hits to his credits like AMAR PREM, ANAND, SAFAR and ARADHANA but in KATI PATANG, his inherent and innate acting prowess shot to that vintage point from where, the exact reflection of his acting skills that were imbued in mystic, elegant and romantic gestures emerged supreme. <br /><br />Coupled with great hit songs and excellent direction of Shakti Samantha, KATI PATANG is a memorable landmark in the filmography of Rajesh Khanna. Being her last lead acting performance on the silver screen, Asha Parekh has also consummately portrayed the pensive image of a forced widow lover.<br /><br />The real to life turbulent story of an innocent girl who was betrayed by her clever boyfriend, had to bear the brunt of a lifetime stigma. Shakti Samantha's direction, R.D. Burman's choreography of songs and majestically soothing cinematography by Gopi Krishna made "Kati Patang" a toast for the eyes and a sublime stimulant for the spirit of audience. The songs and the wording transcends the true beauty of pure love along with the flow of tumultuous events, thereby captivating the audience to stick to their seats till the end. <br /><br />Folks ! they don't make it like Kati Patang, any more ........
