a very mediocre movie. starts in a promising manner but somewhere from the middle or a little before that, it degenerates and fizzes off and finally ends up in a typical bollywood crass. Some comments here on this site are advocating that the suspense is held right to the end, hogwash, the whole movie blurts itself out near it's middle duration and everyone gets to see and know who is the culprit and why. Th other half of the movie is just sitting it out for the sake of sitting.The acting is okay ,comedy from jagdeep may reward a few light moments, but other than that there's little that can be harped about in this one. sorry, I label this one a 'trash'
