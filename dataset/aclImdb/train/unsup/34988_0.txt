I wanted to unwind a little after a long day at the University Library and so when I went to the local Cinema, guess what? Balls of Fury was the only movie closest to my desired time. Without second thoughts, I bought a ticket, went in and sat down in the middle-back of the theater without any expectations whatsoever.<br /><br />"Oh yeah..." That's all I can say. The jokes weren't really jokes to begin with. Though original to some extent, I didn't find them that funny - and that's coming a lot from a guy who has a very wide sense of humor. All throughout the film, I think I only giggled ONCE (No, not laugh. Giggle.) I think the movie had two problems: One, the pacing of the film. Two, Dan Fogler.<br /><br />I think the movie should have spent more time on the tournament and not during the "training". Watching the final scenes, it was like the movie was trying to catch a bad guy or something. Everything was moving pretty fast. It was as if the movie had to meet a deadline and the crew had to finish the film during the last hours.<br /><br />In my opinion, Dan Fogler was awful in this movie. I don't know. Maybe it was the script or the director or whatever. OR MAYBE... It was his sideburns! I really think he could do much better on TV; like in a sitcom or his own show. But in the movies? I'm not really sure.<br /><br />If you are really curious about this movie, just go watch it on video. Better yet, why not wait for it on HBO? Watching it on the big screen is really not worth it.
