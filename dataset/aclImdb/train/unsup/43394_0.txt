X (Live Action) ---------------<br /><br /> The idea behind 'X' is rather good. It is about the clashes of powers of Earth and heavens. Each of these are represented by Dragons of some sort, each dragon has a unique skill. The Dragons fight in Tokyo, as the earth dragons want to destroy humanity and let nature take over Earth as it once were. That pretty much sums it up. The animation of "X" is okay as well - the backgrounds are well done, and the characters are ... artistic. But unfortunately, these two elements combine into a horrible film. The characters lack character, the plot lacks story. Actually what kept me going was the question: "what am I watching this for, anyway?!".<br /><br /> When you actually get to the end (yes, there is one!), you get very disappointed - the last and most important fight (that will determine the fate of Earth) lasts about 20 seconds. The dubbing (sorry, we had some subtitles issues) is awful. Everybody's yelling like they're half - conscious, there's no feel or a touch to it. Actually, the best thing about this title is that it ends and that I DON'T OWN IT. As this is based on a series, even the most fanatic fans should boycott this terrible motion picture... Total waste of time.
