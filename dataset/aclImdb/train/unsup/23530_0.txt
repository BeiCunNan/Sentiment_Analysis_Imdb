Movie, despite being kind of low-budget, was done very well. Only annoying thing was that the props and costumes seemed out of its time, and people looked too clean. <br /><br />Plot is okay, but kind of unexplained. Like, how does Vlad get so much suppoert. <br /><br />I liked the movie because it tries to clear up Vlad's name. Everybody looks at him as this evil-incarnate who killed people, but all that he wanted to do was liberate his people. <br /><br />If you like those gloomy historical movies, then this is for you. I'm giving it 9/10.
