I had seen this movie announced on my cable a couple of times before. The title itself meant nothing to me. Earlier today while browsing through the movie channels I caught the beginning of it. I still had my doubts about seeing it, specially since in a different channel there was a movie about a Gambler in Vegas. I love Vegas, I've been there at least 60 times in my lifetime, so anything related to it, I love. I did go back and forth between the 2 channels a couple of times, but at the end something fascinated me about these siamese twins and their beautiful girlfriend, Penny so I stayed with this one. I could not have made a better decision. I live in Mexico, and was watching the movie with Spanish subtitles. The movie title was translated to Spanish as "Strange fascination". As the story develops, you can go through many different emotions. Love, compassion, sadness, happiness and any other you can think of. You are carried in a strange fascination throughout the development of the plot. The Prostitute, Penny, is simply adorable. They couldn't have chosen a better person to portray this role. I have seen 3 fascinating movies in my life, THE LEGEND OF 1900, SOMEWHERE IN TIME, and this one. This along with the other 2 is the type of movie that you can see several times without ever loosing interest in it. I highly recommend it to all people with sensitivity.
