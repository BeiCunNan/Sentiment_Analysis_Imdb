Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects is fantastic in many ways, it's got non stop action, destroyable arenas and some of the best Marvel Characters to play as. There could of been a few more but I'm happy with the Characters they chose, being a fan of Marvel this is one of the best games I've played. The story is about New York being invaded by mysterious aliens called the Imperfects that are lead by an Alien Scientist that wan'ts to capture the Marvel heroes for his Army but the Marvel heroes are going to try and stop them.<br /><br />The game play is easy to pick up since their isn't any combos instead you press one button to punch and another for a different attack, Story mode has you playing as the Marvel heroes doing a number of missions. The missions have you destroying a bunch of Imperfect robots sometimes with a limit, destroying a number of environments or confronting an Alterted Marvel hero or Imperfect.<br /><br />The Marvel Characters are: <br /><br />Spider-Man,Venom, Iron-Man,Daredevil, Eleckta, Wolverine, Storm, Magneto, The Thing, Human Torch <br /><br />The Imperfects are:<br /><br />Johnny Ohm, Hazmat, The Wink, Fault Zone, Solaris, Brigade, Paragon, Niles Von Roekel <br /><br />For Marvel fans and Beat em up fans Marvel Nemesis is one of the best to go for. 10/10
