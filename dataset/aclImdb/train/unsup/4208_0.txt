The authentic definitive Hollywood film record for posterity of one of the two core dynamics which made/makes the American West: Post "Civil War" Northerners ["yankees"]-verses-Southerners, equals--"Westerners!"...What a stupendous clash of titans! (The other of the two fundamental dynamics was of course the "clash" with Native Americans ["Indians"].)...The same conflicts of culture, politics, "vision", bitterness/resentments/revenge--even language and religion (or the lack thereof) fermented before and during the "Civil War" were continued/extended to "the West" for at least 20 years following the close of the great "War Between the States", with that most famous of bar room brawls gloriously epitomising/personifying these very conflicts! A "must see" for any serious student of real American (especially Southern) History!
