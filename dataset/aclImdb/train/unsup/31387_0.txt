I notice that a lot of comments such as 'Yawn, yawn. Another film about Northern Ireland' were written by people who don't actually live there. Well, I was born in Belfast in 1960 and lived there till 1982, and I can tell you that when you were yawning at the news about people being murdered, tortured, kidnapped, beaten, burned out of their homes, intimidated and imprisoned without trial, the people I lived among were going through it. I think this is an excellent film and very realistic. Julie Walters' accent is spot on, and the humour is, too. People who suffer greatly stay sane by developing a kind of gallows humour. If you think it is a trite film, you must have had an easy life. You've probably spent too much of your time watching movies. This is a luxury accorded to those who live in peace; be grateful you do.
