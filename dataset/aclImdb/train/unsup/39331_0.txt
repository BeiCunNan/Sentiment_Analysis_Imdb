Slight plot spoilers!<br /><br />Oh boy. Where to being with this one. First of all, regardless of what the back of the Blue Underground DVD says, this isn't much of a giallo. It is hardly a horror movie and I am not sure I would even call it a thriller. This is a story that takes place in Australia, but you would never guess it until a scene that takes place in Sydney outside the popular landmark Opera House. Although the true-story premise is fascinating, and the beginning and end of the film are cool, the rest of it is terrible, over-stylized, and dull. The only redeeming thing I found about it was the unique plotting and the funny Nico-like theme song that played over and over again with the unforgettable lyrics "aaaaa paaajaaaamaaaa is a thing that you wear...the sun on yooooour bodyyyy....because yoooou aaaare a wooooman....freee loooove is exciiiiiting." Yeah! The rest of the music consists of annoying synthesizers that sound out of place in such a drama. <br /><br />Anyways, here are Six Things I Learned About Australia Thanks to THE PYJAMA GIRL CASE: 1) Women in Australia clean their feet in the bidet. 2) when a woman dies and goes unidentified, her nude mutilated body is put on public display. Said public gawks at body as if it were a piece of art. More people will claim said body than fake parents claiming that little Natural Redhead "Annie" after Daddy Warbucks offered a reward. 3) It isn't unusual for a bus filled with a female marching band to run over someone. It's such a mundane thing that the band will just march away uninterested. 4) $100 is a reasonable price to charge for a group sex session featuring 2 fat sweaty old men and a Napoleon Dynamite lookalike. 5) Everyone in Australia, including women who live in trailers, have photographs of naked women on their walls. 6) Everyone in Australia is actually from some other country. Yes, this is a goofy movie indeed.
