saw this at a friend's house, but it was not that easy to stay focused.<br /><br />What a load of cramped, un-original metawhores leaching off of the universe of intelligent storytelling.<br /><br />I suppose if I HAD seen any SG-1 episodes apart from the very first, I would know what the hell anybody was talking about! But as trivia on this piece says: Should 'ave been final ep in season 7... - sure thing! Anybody being introduced into the universe of the SG-series at s07 would expect to feel left out at least some of the time. Or, as the case was for me, ALL of the time! Why is it that anything bad just goes on and on and on, while good stories are killed in mid-flight: Firefly, Surface, Invasion etc etc etc? "The lowest common denominator" is not a valid explanation. It HAS to be a conspiracy, TV-network-bosses secretly meeting to pool information about their teenage children's progress in the are of independent thinking - if they collectively show an increase in self awareness, TV-mommies and daddies will automatically cancel shows their children like and commission extra seasons of the ones that bore them. To keep them dull and witless...<br /><br />Hot damn, I am annoyed! This pile of garbage does not even satisfy the cravings of a feverish rainy Synday.<br /><br />Even if it was pleasant to reacquaint oneself with Mr and miss Farscape. But the director killed their few and funny lines with Humpty-Dumpty off-beat editing, and the scriptwriter obviously did not care about anything but the main story lines and just employed a few stereotypic remarks from the great and unfunny book of one-liners to make it seem as if anyone but the set designers and the stuntmen had anything to do one this show...<br /><br />No, please - I'm not done yet. There was one good thing about it, yes, most definitely. No, two, actually: The initial flight in-between mountains lasting some 3-4 minutes with no speak or anything was pretty, and... everything was done in colour. Yes. I believe that's it.
