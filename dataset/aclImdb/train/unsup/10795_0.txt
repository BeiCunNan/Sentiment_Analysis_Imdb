This film made me so very angry. Like a gruesome train wreck, this film is definitely captivating ... in the worst kind of way. As you watch, you realize that you will never get those 24 minutes back.<br /><br />The film, contrary to some opinions, is a random jumble of pseudo-psychological images and scenes laden with tacky Freudean cues. This is simply weird for the sake of being weird--not some deep, insightful treatise. This is someone's idea of what a "post-modern" short student film is supposed to be. There is no real substance here. Notice that the previous reviewer, Rick Hancox, claims that there is a "strong message" though he neglects to mention what that may be. No offense to Mr. Hancox, he is much more optimistic than I.<br /><br />This film is offensive, in that the people involved in making are obviously talented people with some ability at making films. However, this ability is squandered on such trite, self-indulgent crap.<br /><br />Please, for the love of God, don't subject yourself to this. Unless you are interested in knowing what Alex de Large must have felt like after undergoing "therapy" in "A Clockwork Orange".
