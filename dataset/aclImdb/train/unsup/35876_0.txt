Matthew Broderick plays his usual, disinterested blank-faced self, in the clothes of a new college student who gets himself involved by happenstance with the Godfather himself (Marlon Brando).<br /><br />The worst thing about The Freshman is that the godfather himself does not do a good impression of the godfather anymore. And i'll give you a dollar if you can understand a single word he says.<br /><br />The best thing about The Freshman are the jokes about The Godfather: "gee, you look a hellova lot like... ." They're hysterical, and lots of fun if you're a fan of the fim.<br /><br />Highlight: the film class scene where Broderick's lecturer salivates over The Godfather II as he talks about it, then plays a clip from it, and we see him mouthing the words along to it. Lots of fun. Worth a rental to see that scene alone. This is not a good entry in the "fun situation comedy" genre, however.<br /><br />5/10.
