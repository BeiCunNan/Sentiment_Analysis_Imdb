I remember when I this show came out I was about 8 years old when I saw that bubble blowing stand episode. Since then Like looked forward to watching Mr. Squarepants. Until around 2003/2004, this show became<br /><br />overrated!!!!!!! I mean I know this is going to sound stupid but liked it when it was underrated and not many people knew it existed! I mean during/after 2003/2004 sponge bob was a pain !! The episodes were getting repetitive tedious and wrong. It just pretty much got worst after those season!!! List of characters that bother nowadays!!! Spongebob-his voice is annoying and headache inducing (espacially in the later seasons) more immature and moronic than ever!! Patrick-A walking brain dead loser that hangs around bob like a idiot he is. Mr. Krabby-More cheesy and cheap to the point where he should have never exist. Squidward-God this guy is annoying! He constantly bickers about how he hates sponge bob and Pat and yet he still lives next to them.He's very pretentious and is very sad all the time.Every time I look at him he's gives you this suicidal mentality!! Sheesh Squid if you want me to I can end your life for you, you depressed idiot. The only character I can stand is Sandy! that's it!! so folks if you want to see this show you can but still stupid!!
