This is a good series with strong points and weak points.<br /><br />Dick and Joanna leave the hustle and bustle of the big city to operate an historic inn in rural Vermont so that he could write his how-to books in peace and quiet.<br /><br />Except for their employee Leslie, the Loudens do not fit in with the eccentric villagers. Their other employee, George, has to translate some of the culture shock of life in Vermont to a clueless Dick Louden.<br /><br />Character actors who comprise the townsfolk are very eccentric and nothing like real Vermonters. This is a weakness in the plot because it would be better suited for the shock of a civilized couple to relocate into a red-state.<br /><br />Chester the Mayor and Jim his sidekick are some of the annoying semi-regulars, who contradict Dick's wisdom and insight. Kirk, the neighbor, who chases after Leslie, operates the Minute Man Cafe and doesn't know much about the restaurant business.<br /><br />In season two, Leslie leaves town and invites her cousin Stephanie to take over the domestic responsibilities at Stratford Inn for the remainder. She is very much about herself and her unparalleled beauty, which works here to set the series in motion.<br /><br />When preppy TV station producer Michael comes to town to convince Dick to star in a weekly "Vermont Today" series, he and Stephanie hit it off, and the series launches into full steam.<br /><br />Marian and Arthur Vanderkellen, as the wealthy parents of Stephanie, make recurring appearances to pamper their daughter, without trying to understand this sort of village she has escaped into.<br /><br />Uncouth backwoods brothers Larry, Darryl and Darryl expand their roles to become regulars, as another bright spot in the series, in addition to Joanna and George, who bring plenty of charm.<br /><br />This then becomes a wonderful series, far above average, and worth the watch.
