A really good movie. The strongest side of the movie is the acting and what a great actors play in this movie indeed. Robert De Niro well he certainly hasn't made a bad roll in his hole career. Kevin Costner and Sean Connery were good, but I don't think that Connery was worthy of an oscar, he has made better roles. In my opinion the script wasn't very strong, but the acting made this movie a good one. The tagline was nothing new, it's a basic good vs. bad and guess who wins. If you think about it then it's a real life story and that's the real ending... well not quite actually Al got out of the prison few years later because of a disease and lived happily ever after. For the ending I must say that overall it was a movie highly above the average. I'll give this movie eight out of ten and at least five of it is the acting.
