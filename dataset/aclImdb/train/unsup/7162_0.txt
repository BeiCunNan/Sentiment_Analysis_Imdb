From the moment a detective races down a couple of floors and catches a suicidal woman in mid-air to save her from falling 100 feet to her death, you know you are watching something VERY special. Unfortunately, special in every worst possible way. Curiously, a bit further on, a 4 year old child - getting a piggy-back down a lift rope from some guy - loses his grip, falls, and amazingly is caught cleanly in one hand by his mother, who isn't even looking.<br /><br />There are some riveting scenes about a group of lads inexplicably setting fire to everything. They all look like they've just crossed straight from the set of Mad Max 3, and cannot at any point in the film, be taken seriously.<br /><br />Whether this is trying to be 'Towering Inferno', 'Die Hard' or 'Escape from New York', we just don't know. What we do know, is that it shouldn't be trying. We just end up lurching from one ridiculously absurd disaster to another. Social realism you say? When was the last time you heard about somebody fannying about in a lift shaft in an abandoned block of flats in the middle of nowhere?
