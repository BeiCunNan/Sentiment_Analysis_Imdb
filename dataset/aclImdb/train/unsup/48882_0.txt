The original Power Rangers TV show was a fun, much loved, admittedly tacky, but often enjoyable series. The first movie was similar in description, but I think it surpassed the show in several ways. But by the time Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie came along, I realized that it was just going on nothing. The film has one of the stupidest titles I have ever heard, and from that, we get more bad things. The actors are bad, but they were bad in the show too. The villains are the lamest and blandest in the entire long running series. And the turning a boy into a ranger. Blech. Why did they bother? It has redeeming features. Tommy, Adam, Jason and Kinmberly, my picks for the best power rangers are in the film (Billy, who is absent, is my fifth pick). The monster Maligore is bloated and lingually challenged, but cool. And...well, that's it. See the first one. It's also on the bottom one hundred, but it's considerably better than this.
