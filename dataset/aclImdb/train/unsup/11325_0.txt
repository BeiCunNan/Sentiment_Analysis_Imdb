Fell in love with this show the first time I watched it. I watched the dub and I gotta say I loved it. Later I would watch the sub but didn't find it as appealing. The English version is best for people who don't know Japanese. The type of anime that it is just makes it more entertaining to hear in English. It's a great show and yes the dub may not be 100% accurate or great but you can relate to the characters emotions when in English. The new DVD dub is kinda dry. I prefer the VHS dub which are more laid back and well the voices bring out the characters a lot better. The DVD was re-dubbed because a few seconds of episode 2 where nagisa gropes shuns younger brother were cut out in the dub but left in the sub VHS. This isn't a dirty anime or something. It's a well funny light hearted type of anime that if you liked series like tenchi muyo etc would love.
