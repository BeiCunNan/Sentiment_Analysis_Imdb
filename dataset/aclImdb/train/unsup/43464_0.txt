Went to this movie expecting to really enjoy it - was so looking forward to it as both myself and my wife enjoyed the first Hellboy movie a lot. We both love Guillermo del Toro's movies in general and really thought we would love this...<br /><br />We both saw the first Hellboy movie again before watching this (which I would strongly advise you all to do, as that way you will appreciate just how bad this movie is compared).<br /><br />Firstly, the story is absolutely terrible and was not worth making a sequel for - this just seems like a total cash in and nothing else. I can't believe that this is the best story they could come up with for a sequel movie. There is just no substance to the movie whatsoever and some of the acting is pretty bad.<br /><br />Sure there are lots of good special effects and a lot of fighting scenes but it fails to impress as the story is just so bad. The movie has also lost a lot of the edge and suspense it had in the first movie - I seriously feel like the directing in this movie is worse than the first one. Most of the dialogue is dire and amateurish and some of the main scenes in the movie are totally pointless. It really left us feeling empty when we left the cinema and I definitely would not want to see Hellboy 3 anymore should that ever come out.<br /><br />Also - a lot of the del Toro designs in the movie look like they've just been lifted from his other movies and feel very lazy - I would have liked to have seen much more original concepts in his work and am a bit disappointed with that too.<br /><br />Overall - a very disappointed Hellboy fan.
