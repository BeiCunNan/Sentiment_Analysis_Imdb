This is one of the worst movies I have ever-seen, even with its cast, which is impressing when you hear the all names, but they mean nothing, I doubt even if this had, the perfect cast(A Bond age Sean Connery) and Uma Thurman, even with them the plot would collapse, the cast would help, but not enough. The directions some of the worst I have ever-seen to, and the visual effects are surprisingly cheesy, not to mention that Mongols were not sword wielding samurai, without brains, but were horse folk who trained constantly to be able to ride horses without there hand, so they could fight with bows and arrows, they were far from the samurai this mess portrays, they were very noble people.<br /><br />If you liked The Shadow(And I hope you don't) you might enjoy, the much better X-Men films, or the equally bad Godzilla.
