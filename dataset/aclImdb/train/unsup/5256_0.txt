Well, i must say that Matthew Lillard played a great role. The dirrecting was well done and for once i dont think Freddy's character was top on my list Lol. I feel that this movie should have gotten better reviews but i am still happy with it. i have seen it more then a dosen times and it was worth every minut. i would reccomend EVERYONE see it at least once.<br /><br />CHRISTY
