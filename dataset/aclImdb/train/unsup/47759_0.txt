Having not seen the film before, my thoughts were that with Stanwyck, Burr, and Hayden, along with character actor Dano and Fay Wray, how could I go wrong? The actors were wasted on this disjointed script, and the drivel that takes place is almost unwatchable. Some examples: Stanwyck saying I only want to make you happy and hope all your socks have holes so i can darn them then all day. And where was the building up to the marriage. They met, and in 5 minutes were married. The movie builds nothing, things just happen as if the director was on a LSD trip. AVOID.
