saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 86 just a fun to watch romp set in ww1 that the whole family can watch is it full of state of the art special effects? no but they did use real planes and pilots. you get a glimpse of what it was like during that time period. throw in a dash of irreverent comedy. a spoon of slapstick,and and a wacky cast as they set out to fight Germany . if you like the older movies operation petticoat, wackiest ship in the army<br /><br />or up periscope. then this is your kind of movie. as the title says 2 bank robbers escape the law by joining the army and follows them on their adventure as they stumble through WWI
