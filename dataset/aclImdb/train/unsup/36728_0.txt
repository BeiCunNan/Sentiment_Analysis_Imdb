OVA 1 fails to incorporate the qualities of the original anime series that made it such a success. The story lacked both coherence and consistency, jumping around from one idea to another without much development. The entire premise was absurd, almost trivializing the events of the series. Perhaps the writers also forgot that dead people stay that way, as they brought several of them back to take part in the battle. Viewers are left questioning how and why the events occurred, a sign of a poorly made production. I certainly don't recommend seeing this 3 part OVA, even to die-hard, curious FY fans.
