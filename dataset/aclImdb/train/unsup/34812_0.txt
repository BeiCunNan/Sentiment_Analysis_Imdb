Despite all the horrible reviews, I do recommend 88 MINUTES because the screening I attended was filled with so much non-stop laughter. Seriously, the film is frequently hilarious and the chuckles begin with Al Pacino teaching at the University of Beautiful Single Women. Every female, even down to the incidental characters, is a "hottie". A scene involving Pacino dancing at a club actually drew applause. What was funny is that the friend who took me already owned the movie on DVD, but wanted to experience watching it in a theater and he wasn't disappointed by the MST3000 response. Al Pacino truly stepped up by promoting this movie. I'm amazed he's working with the director again, but perhaps the second time is the charm. All in all, a very funny film that plays like an unsold pilot for a series you'd watch every week if they could maintain the laughs.
