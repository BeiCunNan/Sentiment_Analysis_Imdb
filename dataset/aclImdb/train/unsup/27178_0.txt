Girl Fever is a very funny film. It's not quite as funny as 'Eight Days A Week', but there are many great lines and hilarious scenes. One negative thing would be that it borrows from 'Eight Days A Week' a few times too many (our hero won't stop until he gets the girl, the sexoholic best friend, etc..).<br /><br />If you liked 'Eight Days A Week', there's no doubt you'll like this one too.
