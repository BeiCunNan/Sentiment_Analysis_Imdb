Malibu's Most Wanted is one of the craziest films of 2003 Jamie Kennedy delivers a hilarious performance as Brad B-rad Gluckman a white rapper who acts like a black rapper. His father (O'Neal) wants to run for governor but his son's antics are hurting his chances of winning so he hires actors to be gangsters who kidnap B-rad and try to scare him into being a white man again. Regina Hall is amusing as Shondra who in the beginning thinks he's strange but towards the end she falls for him and accepts him for who he truly is. Malibu's Most Wanted is one of those films that leaves you feeling funny and stupid all together but has some hilarious scenes and can be enjoyed by anyone who prefers this brand of comedy. I give it 7 out of 10 stars.
