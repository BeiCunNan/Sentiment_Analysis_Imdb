This has got to be one of THE funniest films I have ever seen! Nick (Cary Grant) was married to Ellen (Irene Dunne) for 4 years before she was shipwrecked, and presumed to be dead. 7 long years later, he remarries (to Gail Patrick) - just as Ellen has finally been rescued. She turns up at his place only to find that he's on his honeymoon, so she hightails it to the hotel to go surprise him. Nick gets himself into an awful pickle trying to find the right time to tell his new wife (whom he has been married to for only a few hours) what has happened, and also telling the children that the new lady that they are enjoying the company of is actually their mother. The plot can only thicken when Nick finds out that Ellen wasn't alone on that island for 7 years, but she had company in the shape of a very athletic (and very single!) man..<br /><br />Funnier than Grant and Dunne's previous comedy, The Awful Truth, and just as sweet as Penny Serenade; this is a definite 10 out of 10!
