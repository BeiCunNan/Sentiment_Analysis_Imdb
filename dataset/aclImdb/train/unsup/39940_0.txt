A typical 1950's Science Fiction flick; thrills are cheap and radiation takes the blame for mutated creatures. Low budget indeed, some footage seems to come from other films. But when your mind is set on watching a low budget movie perfectly fit for the drive-in theater, MONSTER FROM GREEN HELL will suffice. Dr. Quent Brady(Jim Davis)experiments with sending animals and insects into space. A testing rocket containing wasps more than exceeds its flight limits, but lands in a mystery location. When giant wasps are reported terrorizing natives near the location of Green Hell in Africa, Brady and fellow scientist Dan Morgan(Robert Griffin)fly TWA to Africa to investigate. Maybe these giant wasps are related to the cosmic radiation picked in deep space flight. Makes a whole lotta sense when you're a young kid paying to be frightened. Others in the cast: Vladimir Sokoloff, Barbara Turner and Joel Fluellen.
