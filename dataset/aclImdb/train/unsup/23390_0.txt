Tanguy made me laugh even though my understanding of French is far from perfect. The plot is simple - life in his parents Paris apartment is so pleasant Tanguy a post grad student is still there at 28 years old but his parents secretly want him out!<br /><br />Sabine Azema (Tanguys mother) was so funny that she really made the film for me. Don't miss it if you like to laugh!
