This movie is just incredibly bad. It's not even "nice mindless action".<br /><br />Horrible action scenes, no matter if it is clumsy fourth grader wrestling style looking hand to hand combat or slow, plodding gun fights.<br /><br />I didn't expect this to be a well written story or anything, but I have never felt so much disdain for the "heroes".<br /><br />The dialogues are scandalously dumb.<br /><br />Without giving away too much of the movie: There are NUMEROUS scenes where the heroes act DOWNRIGHT stupid and incompetent, plus quite often they run away like scared little girls when having an advantage in numbers during the "fights". Anyone who will find him-/herself rooting for the "good guys" must have the patience and love for good only a buddhist monk can have, because the script and the acting aren't helpful in any way to feel for those guys.<br /><br />The subplot gives you a mentally disabled daughter of the hero whose role is downright offending AND annoying it made me BEG she would get killed or something like that.<br /><br />If you still want to watch this: 1. Make sure you have a soft spot for bad movies 2. Make sure you like to comment a lot during bad movies 3. Make sure you have people with you who fulfill 1 and 2.<br /><br />Worked for me to a degree. But don't even try watching & analizing this in serious fashion, it is THAT bad.
