So I've never posted one of these User Comments, but I had to write about how much I loved this film. The story centers around the two very strong characters of Andy (Baruchel) and Reuben (Quaid). The entire journey kept me captivated from beginning to end (which is no simple feat after a week of festival fatigue) but nothing prepared me for the ending. I have to say, without exaggeration, this film had one of the most perfect and moving conclusions of any film I've ever seen. I won't give anything away here, but I find myself constantly tearing up and moved at the thought of what happens. Now, almost a day later, I still feel its messages and themes rushing through me. Not only is this ending so great, it will probably make a second viewing of this film an entirely different and even stronger experience. My hats off to the writer and director of this film. Damn good work.
