Melodramatic romance about Joan (played by Ann Harding), a woman who strongly believes that marriage is "a business" and decides that a playboy of her acquaintance, John Fletcher (William Powell), a man with a "future" (not to mention a well-trained manservant) is the one for her. She actually falls in love with him, in spite of herself, but he's all playboy and doesn't seem to want to give up the bachelor life. She decides to trick him into marriage by going to his apartment, then changing into "something cooler", after which her father shows up, and for some reason Fletcher agrees to marriage. Well, they're already discussing divorce on the honeymoon and decide to wait six months before they get it. Joan is meanwhile busy pressing her husband to work on making his business a success and give up the polo (even though he's not very ambitious and has stated he prefers the life of leisure).<br /><br />Well, this is an interesting, fairly serious film that stands out based on very well done performances by Ann Harding and William Powell. The flaw for me in the film is that I find the male character to be kind of a jerk and can't really see why she's so gung-ho to want this man - personally, I would take a decent, nice guy any day over a wealthy playboy who's always chasing after other women. In general, I would say this woman has been making some pretty poor choices in her life. But one bonus - the film is loaded with gorgeous dresses on all the women, a nice look at some fashions of the day. A decent film, worth seeing.
