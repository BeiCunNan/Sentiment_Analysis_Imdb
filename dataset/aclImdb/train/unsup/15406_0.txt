Julian Morris is the best actor ever and Whirly girl is perfect movie to watch and especially if you're in love. From this movie I think lot of girls have learned that even if you are a stripper you still can find a perfect guy like is Julian Morris I have to say that the sex scene is so hot. (I wouldn't suggest anyone to watch this movie with kids). <br /><br />I have a lot to say about this movie but I am going to keep it short,<br /><br />I am currently in IRAQ and I think I needed something that really brings me to a real world and that was Whirly girl, It really make me forget the rockets for a little bit, actually they did shut a rocket while I was watching, didn't run to the bunker,(crazy ain't) <br /><br />Julian Morris did a great job and the stripper .OMG she make the movie even better. Thanks for this movie and I wish I could meet Julian and the girl in person to thank for what a great job they've done.<br /><br />(If, you, Mr. Morris or the girl read this comment please contact me at qari06@yahoo.com .(I don't think so) Thank you Thank you Thank you.
