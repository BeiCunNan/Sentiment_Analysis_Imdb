As a mother, I loved this movie. It is just good, clean fun. My son is five, and he insisted we buy the CDs for the first and second movies. And I went along with it. I like the music too. It is just sad when people are down on a kid's movie, as much as they are down on this one. I would like to urge them to please check in with reality. Kids' movies by genre are usually tired and trite. As a babysitter, a child-care provider, an aunt, and a mom I have seen enough of the genre to really appreciate the freshness that is offered by the High School Musical franchise. Come on already! This movie is so much better than other tween/kid crap that is on TV. But it doesn't try to take it's self seriously; which is why I can't believe people actually are. It isn't trying to be a four star movie. It is just trying to be entertaining.<br /><br />Disney supports families. Families want to see good entertainment that is in good taste. I'm not a religious freak, but I want to raise a child; not a kid-going-on-30. And this movie is great for that. Period.
