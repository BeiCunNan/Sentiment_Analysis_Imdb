Okay, I'll admit that I had a pretty good idea of what to expect before I actually sat down to watch this flick. But this film didn't even pretend to have a plot. It was just sex scene after sex scene, which can get boring pretty fast. Now then, if you are just dying to see soft porn (with no storyline, just the sex), this is certainly a good choice, for it is plastered with wall-to-wall nudity and sexuality. But as for the story...what story? This is a movie that should be watched only with your brain turned off, much like the writers had their brains turned off when they scripted this disaster.
