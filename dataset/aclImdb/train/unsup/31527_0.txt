Contains minor spoilers: Well as you can see in the trivia, the film has been playing at the Arts Center Academy Cinema in Chch, NZ for the past 5 years. I live in Chch, NZ and went to see it yesterday in this very cinema. Cinema- well it's actually a black room with 11 seats, 2 speakers and a 60 inch screen, and a small caf√© outside of it. Going 5 years and still going apparently...<br /><br />Now I'm no drama lover. Gimme action, horror, scifi any day. Anything with sex and violence and explosions are good. So I had reservations about seeing this. But wow I must say, this is a contemporary classic. It's the sort of film they must be showing film students in Germany, since the film is in German with subtitles.<br /><br />The 4 main characters are Laszlow (restaurant manager), Ilona (Waitress), Andras (Composer) and Hans (Nazi corporal). It's set in Nazi occupied Hungary during the time Hitler was effecting his 'final solution'. The title 'Gloomy Sunday' comes from the song the composer writes which gains him notoriety, and attracts attention to the (Jewish) restaurant. The film is largely about the love triangle between Andras, Ilona and Laslow. At least until Hans returns half way through the film.<br /><br />The character of Hans appears initially as a lonely, rejected young German man, who after being rejected by Ilona, comes back years later a changed man, a Nazi colonel on charge of the rounding up of Jews in his area. He turns out to be one of the films most 'important' characters. (I won't give away the ending).<br /><br />So all in all, there's romance, there's (some) comedy, there's mystery, and it's all tied in with the Nazi's 'final solution'. After you finish the film you walk away feeling the film is very thought provoking... still thinking about each of the characters and how they changed during the course of the film. It's also worth noting too, that this is not an 'artsy fartsy' film. The dialouge is simple and the story is easy to follow. WHich is appreciated since I don't speak German and was reading subtitles.<br /><br />So anyway, if you don't like dramas but you do like a genuinely good movie, then give this one a try.
