Jeff Goldblum is simply a supreme actor. He has the talent of drawing the audience into the role he is playing at the time and that is a rare thing indeed! This move is a wonderful example of the Headless Horseman story. I wasn't even aware there were VCR copies of the movie. Hopefully the studio/production company will become aware of the need for a DVD of this movie. Considering all the DVDs out there at this time, this DVD would be a step in the right direction of quality home entertainment. Plus, it is not just a seasonal type of movie. The story was very interesting and creative. Definitely worthy of year-round appraisal. See it, it's great!
