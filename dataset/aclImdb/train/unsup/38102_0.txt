I want my five dollars back. This movie stole nearly two hours of my life I will never get back. This movie was utterly terrible. Where do we start? OK first the camera work was shoddy. The script was the worst piece of dung I have ever witnessed. The acting was vomit worthy, seriously this bunch of actors makes Britney Spears and K-Fed look talented. The set's were cheap and the worst I have ever seen in my life. The special effect's where where they? The director and the producer's must have been nut's to think the abomination was even good for a B movie. I could go on for hours about how terrible this movie was. In my humble opinion I think that all copies of this film should be thrown into a fire. Seriously. I recommend you stay as far away from this movie as possible. This is the worst movie I have ever seen.
