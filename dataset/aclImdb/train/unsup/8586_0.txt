Great premise, but they managed to muck it up. This flick was big on stereotypes; small on imagination. A lot of the humor was sophomoric and crass; indicating a not- too - mature writing staff. Some adult supervision would have greatly enhanced this predictable bore. The casting was great - all the main characters were quite capable and the movie did have its moments. Jamie Kennedy had the rap-wannabe dialect down. The movie quickly became bogged down with racial stereotyping, however: hostile blacks, lots of guns, women as sex objects. This film had lots of potential - it just needed some direction and, in the end, originality. The word "bitch" was used so frequently as it would indicate that the script writer received royalties for it. "Bitch", "bee-och"; it quickly graduated from offensive to nauseating.
