In Tombstone Canyon, orphaned cowboy Ken Maynard comes to town to find out about past and tangles with a nasty group of thug cowboys and the disfigured Phantom, a black robed fiend who scares the hell out of all who enter the canyon, a sort of western version of the Phantom Of The Opera mixed with a bit of Batman, who at that time was still a few years off.<br /><br />This has excellent cinematography, good earthy performances by Maynard and the rest of the cast, and lines like "Turn around hombre! I'm a gonna' drill you right between the eyes!", that are pulp western gold.<br /><br />There's a thrilling climax atop some giant rocks and an ending that appears to have anticipated Return Of The Jedi by fifty years!<br /><br />Great stuff.
