A genuine bad movie. I had some higher expectations, since this was on the Sci-fi top 100 on IMDb. But I have never been so disappointed. Really bad acting. What a waste from such superb actors as Liam Neeson and Frances McDorman. And the whole movie is plain ugly. Everything is about killing or molesting people in a cruel manner. Both the bad guys and the "good" guy does that. There is no point in this, and there is nothing realistic going on. The story sucks and the moral of the story? I don't know.<br /><br />I have voted for more than a thousand movies an this is only the third that I find so bad, that I have to give it a 1 of 10.
