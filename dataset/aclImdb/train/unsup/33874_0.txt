The world goes to hell after the oil supply runs out. A scrappy group of survivors holes up in a Philly hospital to try and rebuild society, but when their security is threatened by a roving band of cannibals, they must fight "tooth and nail" to survive.<br /><br />First off, even though the run-time is listed as 94 minutes, this thing dragged on forever. Second, the performances were pretty bad, almost a sense of time-delay on some of the character reactions to other characters. There are plot twists, but they're easy to spot from a mile away. And when one character paints herself up in tribal warpaint, you know it's gone from bad to worse. I should have known better, since it's one of the 8 Films to Die for. And why are Michael Madsen and Vinnie Jones slumming it here? There are a few decent bloody scenes, so that's why I'm rating it so generously with a three.<br /><br />Overall, the idea of society collapsing in on itself when the oil supply runs out was a pretty interesting conceit. Make that movie instead.
