I saw this film and discussion with regiseur at Int. Film Festival 2005 in Bratislava. There were some moments in the film especially at the beginning that confused me - I did not know if it is a comedy or tragedy... The great thing is that such film was created in BiH & Serbia. Homosexuality is not a usual topic there and I hope this film could move things forward and force people at Balcan to think and talk about tolerance with connection to homosexuals and in connection with other nationalities too. I have seen some documentaries from Belegrad about life of gays there. It was very depressing and the message was the same like in this film - go west, don't stay at Balcan. I hope that things are going to improve in Balcan countries and gay-rights will be closer to European standards or they will be at least improving that way. Tomas
