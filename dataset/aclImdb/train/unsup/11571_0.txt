Peter Ustinov portrays Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, traveling on board a steamer ship down the Nile on an interrupted vacation via the murder of a socialite who has offended the entire world it seems, and has been deemed a "leach on the edges of society," to quote one of the characters in the movie.<br /><br />Assisted by David Niven, he must sleuth out the instigator of this interruption before all the ship's passengers end up dead. One by one, they are being knocked off to cover the evidences of the original murder.<br /><br />Fine performances by all involved, but hats off to Mia Farrow! Possibly the most brilliant performance of her career. Stunning. Absolutely stunning.<br /><br />An all-star cast delivers an all-star performance in this top row production. The scenes were deliberate and well planned, the scripting was marvelous, the dialog was funny where it should be and intense where intended, the costuming was marvelously period, and the direction was without peer.<br /><br />But it was the scenery, the settings, the sets and the props that made me love this film. Set in Egypt of the 70's, you can see the Sphinx before it was blasted by 30 more years of sand, bombs and fighting. You get to climb to the top of the pyramid of Khufu in Giza, see the Karnak Temple in Luxor, the Dendara Temple is featured in the background shots of several scenes. You are shown parts of the Philae Temple (temple of Isis), and the Abu Simbel near Aswan (built by Ramses the Great to celebrate his victories and his beloved wife, Nefetari. Lovely images of the Nile, its people and the surrounding areas. <br /><br />Ustinov being one of my favorite Poirot's over the years, I rank this movie at least equal with the Murder On The Orient Express, though I think more money and time were wrongly dedicated to MotOE. Had Ustinov portrayed Poirot in MotOE, it would have been my favorite.<br /><br />There isn't a moment of wasted film in this movie. Every scene gives you some insight into these well-developed characters. Watch for the scene where Bette Davis is "mooned" by the local children! <br /><br />The scene towards the very beginning of the movie, between Maggie Smith and her "Lady," is hilarious. Absolutely side stitching, if you can appreciate the dry, British sense of humor.<br /><br />Top row movie, with top row casting, direction, screenplay and SCENERY. Take an Egyptian vacation in your living room. <br /><br />This masterpiece gets a solid 10/10 (a rarity) from...<br /><br />the Fiend.
