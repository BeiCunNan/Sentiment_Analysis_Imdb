This is not typical Hollywood fare. "To End All Wars" is a redemptive story that features Greek philosophical musings about justice, great quotes from Shakespeare, and the teaching of Jesus about non-retaliation and love for enemies. All of this is set against the backdrop of the suffering endured by Allied soldiers in a jungle prison camp during World War II. The filmmakers provide a fascinating contrast between Eastern and Western cultural values, as well as between Christianity and the Japanese Bushido code of behavior. The movie shows clearly and refreshingly that the worldview of a people does influence its behavior, and that it is possible to judge one worldview as superior to another. It also shows that when human beings act selfishly, they lose hope and end up destroying one another. But when we act with sacrificial love toward each other, not only do we stand a better chance of living, we also keep from becoming savages. What a wonderful, thoughtful film! I heartily recommend it for anyone who is tired of the well-worn, formulaic movies that Hollywood seems to be cranking out these days. If you loved Mel Gibson's, "The Passion of the Christ," you will love this film.
