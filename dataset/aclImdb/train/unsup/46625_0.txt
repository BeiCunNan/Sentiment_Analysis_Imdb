that even my heart went down to 20 bits a minute. <br /><br />But, lets not forget the score. The composer just played a few random cords for 2 hours and... voil√°, we had a complete movie!<br /><br />The best extras... the silk worms.<br /><br />I give it a 2 because the photography was OK, though I don't think this is enough reason to make a film of this caliber.<br /><br />If you feel like to have a very, very relaxing, boring movie session, by all means, go to see it.<br /><br />Blessings!<br /><br />ClearDawn*
