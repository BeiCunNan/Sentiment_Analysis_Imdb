Well, frankly this is virtually a carbon copy of the fantastic 1964 version. Once again, we're in monochrome and the script is almost word for word, with just minor changes. For instance, when General Bogan and the Russian General are discussing their time in London (the 1964 film), here the location has changed to Paris. I really can't see the reason why.....<br /><br />Having seen the 1964 version,it is impossible not to compare the two as you are watching. The film tries hard, but ultimately comes up short through the inability of the actors to match the originals' screen presence. Fonda, O'Herlihy, Matthau and Hagman have no peers in this version.<br /><br />The fact that it was filmed in real time is to be applauded, but it is ultimately unsatisfying. Maybe if this is the only version you have seen, you will be impressed (and apologies for harping on about this), but this is one of those times where you can put two versions of a film together and one will knock spots off the other.
