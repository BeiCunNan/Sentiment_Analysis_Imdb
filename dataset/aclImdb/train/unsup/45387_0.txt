After watching this movie I tried to figure out exactly what point it was trying to make. I mean, if someone writes a play or screenplay, surely there must be some sort of underlying reason that drives them to do so. In this movie it is clearly about promoting acceptance of homosexuality, not only amongst men, but men and school-age boys. I wouldn't like to jump to too many conclusions, but my guess would have to be that a good percentage of the people behind this production are themselves gay, and have felt marginalised for a good part of their lives. The worst part of all of this, is that the movie was grossly, falsely, advertised. This was done, I suspect, so that this movie's "subtle" preachings were not to be done solely to the converted. The continuous references to poetry (whether they were relevant or not, who cares, they were plain boring) would be enough to keep almost everyone who might have considered reading a bit of poetry in their spare time to seriously reconsider. It appears obvious that the actors have merely learnt their lines, and delivered them in such a clich√©d manner as to appear "intellectual" without actually really caring about what is coming out of their mouths. All-in-all I really hope that schools in England are, or were, not as depicted in this movie, and that actual teachers and Dons at Oxford take offence rather than sympathise with this shocker.
