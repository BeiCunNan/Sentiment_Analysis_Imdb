... I'm a big, big fan of Kiyoshi Kurosawa, and I think this is the best film he's made to date, maybe even better than 'Cure'. Awesomely disturbing, with beautiful filmography, great acting and a nice apocalyptic feel. Possibly my joint favourite of all the Japanese modern horror films (along with 'Ringu'). Essential viewing.
