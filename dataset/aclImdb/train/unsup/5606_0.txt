I expected more by this movie, and let's admit that after having watched Fandango, I was a little disappointed, although some good elements are to be appreciated. Especially the beginning is a little slow and probably indulges in insignificant details (the party at Leroy's is too long, we perfectly know what kind of mood dominated those guys). Moreover, the story covers twelve years, from 1962 to 1974, a time-length during which the three boys should have been touched by the events of their personal lives and by history as well, on the contrary they remain a little underdeveloped till the very end. Obviously, it is impossible not to sympathize with them, they are really cute, captivating, but I expected more psychological insight. As it approaches the end, the movie gains rhythm; the final, in every sense, encounter with the big wave is rendered greatly, surfing action is truly gripping, we perceive the strong emotion when facing and struggling against this force of nature, and we also get more intimate with the characters's inner emotional world, probably because the confrontation between man and nature, with the undeniable sense of human finiteness as compared to the greatness of nature, always reveals the real quality of human life. It is also in the end that we sense the strong friendship of these boys having now turned men, and we understand how real friendship surpasses the years and the comradeship of youth. There is also a sense of nostalgia for the past years, but with the perception that what we experienced will always remain in our future lives as a precious treasure. Undeniable that the movie delivers also funny moments, mainly when we see these guys pretending every kind of physical and mental distress, in order to avoid the spectre of Vietnam: really amusing. A movie I would advise to a cinemagoer interested in the American film-rendering of the 60's 70's, but warning that cult movies are something different.
