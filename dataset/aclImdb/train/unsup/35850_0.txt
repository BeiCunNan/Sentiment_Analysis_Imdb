Watching this movie is like watching everything that was good drained from it predecessor.<br /><br />The martial arts scenes are unimpressive, lacking the speed and energy of the original. If the actors had much martial arts skill, they certainly don't show it. The editing in these scenes is workmanlike at best. Admittedly Peck Prior didn't have much to work with but there are several points during the fight scenes where you can't even tell what's going on.<br /><br />While the sets of the original had a cool expressionist look, these had the look of a Power Rangers movie. Leonetti certainly does a lot with special effects but they just don't look very good (Motaro was pretty well done though).<br /><br />Meanwhile the music track had little merit. Most of the notable musical themes were taken from the first movie.
