This is a good movie, not a great one; What would happen if you where framed for murder, in a strange land with strange laws, compared to your own. Fear is what this movie evokes, Richard Gear feels like an outsider, who is viewed of having western decident values, in a society where his lawyer states the groups importance over the individual in society. Admitance to guilt is considered aceptance of society's morality. This film gave me a sence of reality about communist society, and what its like in the comune part. Its a interesting movie. I read some of the reviews, and did not find this movie offenceive, it showed a side, but was not preachy. With movies like "The Texas Chainsaw Masacure, and Deliverence you see very few people complain that this is a bad sterotype of the south, most people find it a small picture of extremes not confused with the whole south. Thoes two movie went much farther then Red Corner.
