Referring back to the previous comment - I sure have a sense of humor, and a quirky one at that, (love monty python, super troopers, shaun of the dead, etc) but this has to be the worst movie ever! No wonder its on pay TV at 2am. It is even hard to tell what genre this is, and the murder scenes are just so wrong. Not to mention the bad effects, acting, fashion and hair dos. Also, since I am German, I didn't really appreciate the use of a nazi propaganda song from world war II. I would add something positive but I just cannot find anything to say. Sorry, but unfortunately I have to say this one is definitely not worth watching.
