i happened upon this film being shown on the BBC, as it always seems to do with really good movies, late, late, late one night quite a few years ago. to my horror no matter how hard i tried to wedge the matchsticks under my eyes, i could not manage to stay fully awake and with disastrous timing my video had given up the ghost the week before...alas i was lost!!!!!!! the portion of the film i saw had me in stitches,(Marty Feldman's Nursey would have been ecstatic), all the cream of the newly emerging alternative comedy scene seemed to be taking part and set me on a, until now, fruitless quest to track down a trace of this classic through the years. the previous commentator stated he has a copy... GASP!!! THE HOLY GRAIL!!! if anyone out there knows how i can obtain a copy of this fantastic, much overlooked classic, please please please can they get in touch with me at nikimeijei@aol.com and let me know so that i may finally finish a film i began watching sometime in the late nineties. Have mercy on me and put me out of this misery.
