The black vaudeville team of Mantan Moreland and Flournoy Miller appear together as two men assigned to be night watchmen in a haunted pawn shop. One of the gags has Mr. Miller sitting down in an armchair, the arms of the chair grab him, and he shouts "Old rockin chair's got me", followed immediately by the song Rockin Chair, by Hoagy Carmichael, playing loudly. A miniature jazz band comes to life and plays. The band is led by Noble Sissle, the longtime musical partner of Eubie Blake. The great clarinettist Buster Bailey is featured in the band. They play red hot versions of Tiger Rag and The St. Louis Blues. The absolutely brilliant Harlem singer and dancer Cora La Redd tears up the place with her incredible singing and dancing. An old washboard comes to life and is soon being played by The Washboard Serenaders. Finally Mr. Miller and Mr. Moreland flee in fright, with Mr. Moreland running out of his shoes, which follow him, crying out "Wait for me". One of the greatest jazz shorts ever made.
