This Movie Was Terrible to put it in 1 word.....<br /><br />3 out of ten is actually quite good for this movie.....<br /><br />With its complicated in depth story which never makes sense anywhere through the film to the characters terrible performance which lacks emotion within them, really makes me ashamed to say I am a fan of the game.This film doesn't have a hero to be straight,i am actually by the end glad there all being killed of because you honestly don't really care and have no reason to care what happens to them, if your still watching it by that time that is. The first time I herd this film was going to happen i was Extactic I thought that this was going to be a film based on the game.The computer game holds a simple story which leaves you guessing what has happened, This film doesn't keep you guessing you can almost tell who is going to die and what is going to happen that a virus has spread through the facility and these people who go in are heading for trouble, which can somebody tell me how the hell they could of built that under a city. This film is all over the place If a was directing this movie a would of shot everything again or scrapped the project all together. This film should of just been a remake of the game not this total mistake of a movie!! <br /><br />I really hope this was useful to you!!
