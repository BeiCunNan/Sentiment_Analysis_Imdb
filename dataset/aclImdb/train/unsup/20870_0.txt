I am a fan of this show, as the skits they do are often very, very funny and disturbing, although I must admit that I wish the repertoire of skits was greater. Each episode features almost the exact same small group of characters as done brilliantly by Matt Lucas and David Walliams. Most are of the characters are very funny, but even some of the funny ones lose their punch when you see the same characters episode after episode.<br /><br />Some of the ones that are exceptional and don't seem to get old with repeated segments are the adventures of Daffyd, the only gay in Llandewi Brefi (a town I visited on my last trip to Wales because of this show), the nasty lady at the Fat Fighters club meeting, the two transvestites and the bizarre narration by Tom Baker (of Dr. Who fame). Some, though funny, just seem to lose steam after a while (such as the guy who breast feeds). And one or two are just so gross that I cannot watch the show with my wife, as she'll leave the room (in particular, the guy who is sexually attracted to old ladies--fortunately this gross skit isn't seen that often).<br /><br />If you have a rather strong constitution and like your humor very twisted and gross, then give this a watch. Also, those who like THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN will probably love this show and vice-versa--they both really, really push the limits of taste but are quite funny for twisted folks like myself. However, do NOT let your kids watch it--the subject matter is often very adult, as is the language and there is some nudity.
