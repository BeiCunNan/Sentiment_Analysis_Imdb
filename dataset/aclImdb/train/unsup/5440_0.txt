Death has never been this young and sexy. When this film opened this weekend I had never heard of it nor seen a preview or read a review. At the multiplex this film opened at the smallest screen and the girl in the ticket booth told me they had not jet received the posters for the film But opt to show it anyway. The title starred at me blankly from the cinema monitor and the words" possessed" and "exorcism" appealed more to me then Brock back Mountain. This movie starts of with a priest performing and exorcism on a Hispanic girl that somehow had turned into a demon African American witch later makes the priest claw is own eyes out. The exorcism was a success but rendered him blind. The movie continues with a young girl played by sexy lead young adult with a dirty mount like your would not believe, moving to Florida with her sister and her husband due to the double death of her parents. For no apparent reason she becomes possessed spending all her time in her room-the garage, lingering, plotting , watching TV and sending her new slut friend to her grave. Various believable doctors try their best to pin a diagnose on her ether wanting to go with possession or latent massive depression. During this the movie builds up to a massive climax. The demon possessing this young girl Goes completely bananas and a horde of priest comes to her rescue, including the priest form the intro, now blind, but full of hope and anger towards the demons walking this earth in human forms, performing an exorcism that lead to their final hour falling pray to the angry demon within. What to say about this film?? I was not expecting a blockbuster at the multiplex that Friday, but I found it more entertaining the The Fog(2005) but not on the same planet as Emily Rose. It was shot in digital with a very porno film quality and sets, with terrible editing and poor directing, weak actors but beautiful female leads. It some what surprises me what goes as movies these days?
