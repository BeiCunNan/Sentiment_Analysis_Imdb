Because I'm re-enrolling for post-graduate summer school!<br /><br />This picture proves that on occasion a less-than-deep storyline doesn't prevent a film from being terrifically-entertaining. You'll be dragged along willingly and unprotestingly in the offbeat proceedings onscreen. <br /><br />And Angie Dickinson (who seems to be thoroughly enjoying her part) is stunning, gentlemen ... stunning!<br /><br />Recall that gorgeous teacher we all remember oh-so-well from high school? Well, here ... she ... is. And John David Carson plays, uh ... every guy who was ever in her class, okay?<br /><br />Things move along smoothly in parallel plots, a strange mix of sex comedy and murder-most-foul. But it all works, and you won't forget "Pretty Maids" any easier than you ever forgot ... that long-ago teacher.<br /><br />Highly recommended, for adults.
