MGM's motto was that they had more stars than there are in heaven or something to that effect. No movie proved it better than Grand Hotel. Before Grand Hotel, it would have been unthinkable to put more than two of a studios top stars in one film. MGM rolled the dice and put Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Wallace Beery, Lionel Barrymore and Joan Crawford together for a memorable film. To support them they included the best of their second string character actors such as Lewis Stone and Gene Hersholt to name but two. The gamble payed off and Grand Hotel was awarded the Best Picture Oscar. All of the stars put in a great performance but in my opinion Joan Crawford really stands out in this one. Garbo's performance is good but seems rather strained. The Barrymore brothers do a fine job. Wallace Beery is fabulous as the tough as nails industrialist who gets in over his head. MGM wouldn't wait long to try the formula again releasing another all star cast film Dinner At Eight two years later.
