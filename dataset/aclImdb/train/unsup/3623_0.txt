..and I say that after much thought - it's not just a knee-jerk reaction.<br /><br />I'm a sci-fi and action movie fan OK? And I have no problem suspending my disbelief if the story is good. But this was utter rubbish. The storyline is so weak and huge gaping plot-holes abound in this turkey. Once the "technology" was explained (not very well I might add, by Adam Goldberg's supposedly comic-relief techy) I thought, "Why not just send a message back to the cops warning them of the explosion? Or the ferry captain?" And whatever happened to acting? Denzel is sleep-walking, Val Kilmer has so few lines but he manages to invest them with all the emotion of a cabbage. And who were the others again...? Sorry, they seem to have slipped my mind.<br /><br />Oh, and it didn't look THAT good.<br /><br />All in all, a waste of Â£10.
