It's in the top 250 at IMDB. Wow! Did we see the same movie? This is one of the worst movies I've ever sat through.<br /><br />I'd heard so much about Kevin Smith's clever dialogue, but unless you think that mentioning a fictional toddler movie title followed by a list of ersatz porno movie titles is wit, you'll find this movie as moronic as I did. Even by the movie's low budget standards, the acting is uniformly terrible -- I've seen more compelling high school theater. The plot, if you can call it that, is arbitrary in the worst way.<br /><br />Couple this with over-the-top stylized cinematography that serves no aesthetic purpose, characters that show no development and come to us purely through clunky exposition, and you have the most over-rated movie of the 90's.
