I can't believe I actually bought this movie! Someone said B-movies are good if you watch them with an open mind, but I'd have to axe mine to go through another ordeal like this one. Aaargh! Too bad IMDb doesn't believe in giving zero stars... Well, there's this lady in a futuristic time, who can save mankind as we know it, and there's this man who is constantly trying to save her from the robots that want to kill... kill... kill. But everybody remotely associated with this movie seemed to be acting robotic - the villain, the hero, the cameraman, the director (hell, I could even see the guy in a couple of frames!) That's it. I have lost it for B-movies because of American Cyborg Steel Whateva!
