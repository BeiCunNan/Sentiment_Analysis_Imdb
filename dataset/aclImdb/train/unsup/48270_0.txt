If you've seen/read Stephen King's "It," don't bother with this movie. Let's see....killer clown who has been around for well over a hundred years who kills little children. No one seems to be able to solve the mysterious murders, and, what a surprise, only kids are able to see the clown. The clown is all clownish until he goes in for the kill, where his face turns evil and his teeth go razor sharp. There's a scene where he kills a little girl in her yard amongst sheets hanging on a clothes line. There's a street named Dairy. Am I talking about Hellbreeder or "It"? The clue is "Dairy." In "It," it's the name of a town, not a street. If only the clown's name in Hellbreeder had've been Pennywizard...
