I love this movie.<br /><br />First saw it quite a few years ago and now it's just been on MGM.<br /><br />I love end of the world movies.<br /><br />Looks like George W Bush may bring this love to life!<br /><br />Having now seen it a few times I can get to savour its elements...the way the beginning give no clue to subsequent events and the doubt some may have right through it that it's all some horrendous mistake.<br /><br />What a wonderful way to die!<br /><br />What a great way for Los Angeles to end!<br /><br />The cast and direction and music are outstanding.<br /><br />
