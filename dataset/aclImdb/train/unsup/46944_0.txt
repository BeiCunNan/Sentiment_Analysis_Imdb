I love Melissa Bank's sophisticated, complex, moving fiction and I was very curious when I heard that some of the stories in her first novel/short story collection were being made into a movie. What a disappointment! I can hardly imagine what it was like for MB to discover that Sarah Michelle Gellar was going to play the Jewish intellectual associate editor. She is ludicrous in the role, and the idea of her editing novels was a stretch that no act of imagination could make remotely plausible -- the only thing you could imagine her checking on her Blackberry was where the next high school pool party with the cute guy was taking place. The idea that the Alec Baldwin character would be interested in someone that flat, brainless and teeny-bopperish was beyond silly. Try as she might, SMG, who is talented and can be funny in the right movies, could not pull this role off. The good lines were MB's, the ones that were added by the director made me wince -- every clich√© you could pull out of a Hollywood grab-bag. An embarrassing and depressing example of how to ruin a great book. I hope MB has better luck with the marvelous Wonder Spot. Now if brilliant Clare Danes had been cast, this movie would still be poor, but not quite as unwatchable.
