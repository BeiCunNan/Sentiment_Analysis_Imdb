Seeing this movie for the 1st time almost 7 years since it's release brought me mixed emotions. I laughed hysterical at most of the scenes Chris Farley was in as I have with all of his other starring roles. On the other hand I was reminded of how sad it was of his untimely death. I must have avoided this movie because it was released after his death and I was not ready to enjoy another comedy with him at that time. I will certainly buy this movie and add it to my collection with Tommy Boy and Black Sheep. I also enjoyed the supporting cast of characters, I'm not a big fan of "Friends" but I thought Mathew Perry was good in this movie.
