One of Bu√±uel's greatest films. Scene after scene arguments are used as beautiful excuses to subvert reality and attack established and hypocritical institutions with acute humor and surrealist means. If you have a taste for surrealism and absurd humor (i.e. Monty Python, Marx Bros., etc.) this movie cannot be recommended enough.<br /><br />One small correction: the sniper is not sentenced to death but to capital punishment which results in something altogether different from death (and far more sarcastic).<br /><br />
