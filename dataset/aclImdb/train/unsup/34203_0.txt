Awful. AWFUL!!! My best friend rented this because it had a scary cover and we watched it tonight for halloween. THIS MOVIE is SO BORING. IT IS A WASTE OF LIFE. It should be called The off season a story of the most boring couple ever. I diddn't remember seeing any ghosts. It is so terrible it looks like someone filmed it on their camera phone. The woman in the movie sees blood in her bed but she doesn't care until halfway through the movie! HOW STUPID!! Oh my god I hate this movie so much. Blockbuster is being silly...how could they put this out to the public. Some movies are so bad its funny but this was just so dull, if anything scary was about to happen it jumped to nothing just banal every day living of a boring ass couple who don't make love, watch TV, go out, or do anything interesting except SIT IN A CHEAP MOTEL ROOM and have an answering machine talk to them from time to time. What a silly movie! I guess it was so bad that it was slightly funny and did not succeed in ruining my halloween.
