This is my favourite film, so imagine how disturbed I was when I picked this up on DVD and discovered the awesome soundtrack had been changed!<br /><br />I have no idea why they decided to change the music for the DVD release, but the film was much cooler with the original soundtrack. <br /><br />In fact, some of the scenes don't even work without the original music - the characters movements are totally out of time - check out the Church scene at the end - why are they dancing to bells? Originally it was a cool rock song.<br /><br />The scene at the dodgy S&M club has also been changed. The music doesn't stop when Beth and Steve enter the room. I can't describe what an awful experience it is watching this film without the original music.<br /><br />The film, with the original soundtrack, is absolutely awesome. I could model my life on the teachings of Dave Marshack - in fact, his name was on my fake id up until i could drink legally.
