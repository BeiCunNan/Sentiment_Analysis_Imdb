I saw this at the Museum of Radio and Television (don't think it's available on DVD). I had first seen it as what now called a "questioning" young man in 1972 (the son's character was 14, I was 13 at the time) and remembered it being very important to me as the first sensitive, non- judgmental portrayal of gay men on television. I particularly remembered the poise of a very young Martin Sheen. Viewing it again after 35 years it was almost as affecting, with wonderful acting by a very strong ensemble cast, with Hope Lange a stand-out as the mother/ex-wife. I enjoyed the early-70s touches (shag carpeting in the bathroom, 8-track cassettes) but realized that -- despite so many advances in gay rights over the years -- it could almost be re-made today and still make sense. Cross your fingers that this someday is available on DVD.
