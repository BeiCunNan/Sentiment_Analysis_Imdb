Kisna is a very beautiful movie. I loved every part. I have watched it multiple times now and enjoy watching it. I will likely watch this movie many more times since my friend owns a DVD and I am buying one. This movie obviously may not appeal to everyone, but then again this movie is not for everyone. If you love a good love story that makes you cry... then Kisna is a beautiful love story that will do just that. I personally enjoy watching beautiful love stories and this movie left me feeling mushy and sentimental. I can really identify with this movie. I am in love with this movie. Kisna is absolutely hot and gorgeous too! I have fallen back in love again with the idea of being in love... even with all the sad times that make love so painful~ UGH! Hugs! <3Princess
