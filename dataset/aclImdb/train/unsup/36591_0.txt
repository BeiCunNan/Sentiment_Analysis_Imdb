Yes, I came from my university's greek system, but that isn't the reason I think this made-for-TV flick was total crap. The whole thing is just stupid overall. I can assure you that no men are allowed in the sorority house rooms, aside from the atrium/living room, at any time. Trust me, I was your average college guy who would have LOVED to have seen the rest of the house but it flat out wasn't allowed. Not only that, but the alcohol in the house would have resulted in a chapter shutdown. I've seen it happen and it's not a pretty sight. The glaring stupidity that makes the movie look unrealistic is the ridiculous part where the cops just happen to be waiting for the girl who has marijuana planted in her car. Amazing how sorority girls got the stuff so easily. Not only that, but she is just let off with a warning??!!?!?!?!? What the hell is that? They let off DRUG POSSESSION SUSPECTS with a WARNING?!?!?!?!? Was this flick made in Fantasyland?<br /><br />This was the worst portrayal of college life since Higher Learning. Anyone who recommends watching a stupid made-for-TV movie before "allowing" their college-aged (and therefore legally adult) children to join an organization needs to find a more credible source. This was as much like my college as Saved By the Bell was like my high school.
