Now that the second season is concluding, I want to say that I HATE this show, which gives off a bad vibe spreading like a plague. Thanks to Marc Cherry, we will be living with these dumbfounded housewives for the next few years, unless people get their brains checked, which is unlikely to happen! This show is an advocate for woman to watch 4 overrated actresses (not including Felicity Huffman, the only good one) to go through all these dumb stories that would better on "Days Of Our Lives" I can't stand it, I hate it! Most the cast is really bad too. Especially Marsha Cross, she is so ugly, and her head looks like a golden egg, or something all shiny and tight because she is so stupid and concerned about a single line that she is willing to look inhuman to fix it, and her acting is total crap! Avoid this junk!
