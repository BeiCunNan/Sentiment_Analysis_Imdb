Anyone who doesn't think that 'The Five Doctors' doesn't have a plot, may reconsider after reading this.<br /><br />The Doctors are brought together by the Renegade Timelord, President Berusa of Gallifrey, in an evil plan to become immortal. They are all seized by him and end up on their old planet Galifrey. Of course they are all still trying to work out why they have been brought here, as there is no indication why but they figure it must have something to do with Rassilons tomb, which lies in the tower. In turn, each doctor has to face some of their most fearsome foes and dangers, in an area called the Death Zone, to reach the tower of Rassilon, where the the ring for immortality is kept. The renegade time lord, Berusa, controls the mind of the fifth doctor, when he works out that Berusa is up to something, in attempt to gain immortality, so that he can be the Lord President of Gallifrey forever. He had sent the Doctors to the Death Zone on Gallifrey to defeat the enemies and dangers that lay before the tower. Berusa then tries to use the Doctor as a servant, in a bid for immortality. However little does Berusa know that immortality is a trap itself, as the First Doctor works out from an inscription in the tomb. This lets Berusa finally get what he wants, to find out he gets set in stone forever. All the doctors are then set free, however the fifth doctor is informed that he is now declared Lord President of Gallifrey but he says to the Chanellor of Gallifrey, to take charge until he returns, which is the beginning of the doctor going on the run from his own people. Which is how it all started, as he states at the end. <br /><br />If thats not a plot, I don't know what is!
