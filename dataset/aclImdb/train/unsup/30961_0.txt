Having hoped this would of turned out to be a low grade trash gem along the lines of Giallo a Venezia.I was sadly let down as its barely even a thriller,its purely a shot on the road location skin flick with a few crimes thrown in our pair come across on their travels like a knife wielding guy.The plot as it is,vaguely resembles a cross between Mario Bava's Rabid Dogs and Thelma and Louise with a very slight Russ Meyer feel of lets just get naked because we've got a few ample sized lead actresses.<br /><br />Its gotta be noted that this was directed by Roberto Mauri who made Le Notti della violenza/Night of Violence one of the very 1st Italian giallo films.Which makes it even more sad that he ended up making crude junk like this.That said there's lots of sex to keep exploitation fans happy just hope they wasn't expecting anything from the plot,A tiring travelogue of sex and crime,something that shouldn't be this boring but it is.I gave this a below average [3 out of 10]
