i think Magnifico is really great.I cried while watching the movie.One of the best Filipino movies I've ever seen. The story is so simple but the message is so deep. It's nice to know that kids can think beyond everyday living even if his family is only poor. Jiro Manio's (Pikoy) portrayal of a young boy who took it upon himself to raise money in order for her grandmother's burial/death to be less hard on the family financially was so poignantly moving.The acting of the other cast were also really good especially for the seasoned actors and actresses like Lorna Tolentino (Pikoy's mother), Gloria Romero (who played the bedridden grandmother) and Albert Martinez (the father). Isabella de Leon, the girl who played the invalid sister, was also great in her role.
