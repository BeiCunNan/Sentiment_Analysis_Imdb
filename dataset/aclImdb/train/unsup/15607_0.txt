Saint Teresa of Jesus (Avila) is so beautifully portrayed in this movie, and brings her writings into a brilliant reality. For those who have read her works, you will see her actions lived out along with her spiritual insights. The acting could not be better, it is human and humble. I really enjoyed the true-to-life settings, and language. I am happy to see this series has won awards, and Concha Velasco won my heart over. Her portrayal of this Saint was remarkable due to the ability to convey humility, spiritual depth, holy virtue, love for Jesus Christ, and over the course of time to age in character. The rest of the cast was superb in evoking a love or hate relationship for the viewer because one either will love or hate Saint Teresa of Jesus, and those for or against her strong determination to create the Discalced Carmelite Order that has flourished through-out the world to this day. I highly recommend this to anyone, believer or not. You will be inspired by one woman's courage to follow through, and will never be able to feel self-pity or make excuses you can't do something great with your own life after watching this series.<br /><br />There really should be more series made for TV just like this one. The world surely needs them.
