Mississippi Burning is one of my favorite Gene Hackman movies. I remember watching it when I was young, it was one of the few rated R movies my parents would allow me to watch. Such a powerful story about the disappearance of three civil rights workers down in rural Mississippi. When the Feds are called in to investigate the disappearance, the action really heats up. Dafoe is perfect in playing the FBI agent opposite Hackman. Hackman is the charming, funny, and very smart to whats happening around him. Not that he doesnt care what he's down there for, but he's taking in the surroundings, he knows how these people operate. Dafoe is quite the opposite. Strict, by the book agent who seems to take it more seriously. Dafoe's character seems to be in shock of what's going on around him, but Hackman seems to know exactly whats wrong. Great suspense, and a great depiction of this time in history, when being black in the South might get you killed. Based on a true story.
