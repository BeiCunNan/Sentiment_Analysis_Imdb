I LOVE this movie. This movie is a great Christmas movie and is amazing. I like how they can do a musical retelling of this story. This was actually based on a old play written by two unknown playwrights Fred Speilman and Janice Toore, however they closed the play after one night. After a lot of the legal dust was settled and the slander was lifted they reissued the play at my old acting school. I was one person to play Marley's Ghost and Christmas Future. I also noticed that Fezziwig was seen in a once shot but didn't get any speaking words. The past scene mostly focused on Scrooge's romance with Belle, and the present scene had Tiny Tim and family, and a scene with Fred. I would have liked it if they had a longer future scene, and more scenes. I would also like to say THank you, Charles Dickens, he's long dead, but he's with us in spirit, for this great story.
