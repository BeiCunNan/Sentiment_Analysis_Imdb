I wanted to love "Get Carter". Because I love mobster movies, movies that take place in Vegas, and Stallone is one of my all time fav actors and him playing a hitman, in Vegas was a match made in heaven, but the film still sucked. Had some good action scenes but it was all still a bore. I did found myself looking at my watch a lot and wondering when this was going to be over. Here is a little info about the story. Sly plays a bad-ass hitman who is a former prisoner too and he finds out that his brother has been killed and now he is pissed and he will make the killer pay. Been there. Done that. But hey, the acting is still much better than a lot of other crappy action movies. Sly and crew will impress you with the acting and you may think it is a shame that great actors like that wasted their time making this movie, The flick made Sly look like Rocky again because he was made out to be very tough. Which was cool because I was glad to see Rocky come out again. Somewhere in Sly's body, Rocky is in there lurking who comes out every now and then to make us cheer. And I don't blame Sly, Mike, or Mick for this bad movie. They are all great actors and did great in this, the story itself just sucked. Course, if you ever are at home on a Friday night and your just typing away at the computer and the TV is on and you just want something to listen to, "Get Carter" is not a bad choice. Because every now and then you may just turn away from the puter' to see what Sly and the boys are up to doing. And "Get Carter" was much better than Sly's newest film, "Driven".<br /><br />
