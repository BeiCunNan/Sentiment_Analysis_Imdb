I'm a bit embarrassed that I even saw it, but I'll see just about anything, especially if I can see it in a theater. But I should have known! I hated Todd Phillips's Old School. It was sloppy in ever way possible. The guy knew neither how to direct nor write. But the commercials for this film made me laugh, and I love the chemistry between Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson; their bit at the Oscars last week cracked me up. But, damn, if Phillips didn't prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is one of the worst directors in Hollywood right now. The guy has no clue how to construct a joke! If you don't trust me and need proof, then, please, do check out this piece of crap. There are any number of funny situations that are set up, but there is hardly ever pay-off, and the few times when Phillips does come through he doesn't come through nearly enough. For every laugh, and there is a small handful of them, almost anyone on the street could have re-written the joke to be funnier. The only thing that was great was the stunt driving, but I'm probably one of the three people who still go to movies who doesn't go to the movies for that. 4/10.
