Startship Troopers 3 is a very baaaaad movie. In fact, one of the worst I have ever seen. I enjoyed the first one but this sequel is just terrible.<br /><br />The actors are just ridiculous, the dialogs awful and the special effects very poor. Having the actor from the first one (Rico) helped a little to watch this movie (not that he is a good actor).<br /><br />A singing chief of the armies, kamikaze bugs, hanging of peace protestants and many more. Just a few examples of the absurdities of this movie.<br /><br />The worst thing in that movie is the constant and absurd religious comments and references. The mix of those references with the obscenities, violence and naked scene is a very questionable choice in my opinion (not that I didn't enjoyed the naked scenes).<br /><br />At best that movies is entertaining but it can easily become really boring.
