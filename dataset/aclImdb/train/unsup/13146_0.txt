This one needed a few changes, since (unlike the books) this Indian outing is set *after* the Peninsular war and blends several of the "Indian" Sharpe books. This is of course unavoidable, partly because the cast are all ten years older but also because the first Sharpe film skipped over the Indian books and had Sharpe obtaining his field commission in Spain rather than in India. Thus they need another horrible sergeant to replace Hakeswill, for example. That is only relevant for obsessives and the whole thing is a proper dose of Sharpe- all the usual elements of the formula are well serviced. Some truly excellent moments and clearly with a higher budget that the originals. India provides a spectacular backdrop and the attention to detail is as impressive as ever (even if, as ever in the films, the cannon shot continues to explode inappropriately). Enjoy!
