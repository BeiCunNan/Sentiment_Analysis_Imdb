Another fairly predictable "Nightmare on Elm Street" story finds young Jesse Walsh trying to fight off a very rude intrusion by Freddy Krueger. David Chaskin has taken Wes Craven's original characters to create this new tale for director Jack Sholder.<br /><br />This film is viewable thanks to a good performance by Mark Patton in the role of Jesse Walsh. Kim Myers also starred. Over all, the content is still trashy and the level of entertainment is still average. "Elm Street Two" is one of the shortest films I have seen in a while. Running time is only eighty minutes. However, I guess we should be grateful for small mercies.<br /><br />Tuesday, September 17, 1991 - Video
