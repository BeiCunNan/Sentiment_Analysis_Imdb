Very disappointing, it might have been good in 1981, and it might have inspired 5th Element, but that doesn't make up for the (disastrous) rest. The first part with the taxi driver is almost ok! The rest is very meaningless. I rented this because it was refereed to as one of the first adult-orientated cartoons. √ç cannot speak for the others, but for myself I believe that "adult" is more than (boring) sex and (boring) violence and gore. The worst thing about this movie is the total lack of story. Good against evil has never been portrayed so.. shallow and uninteresting.<br /><br />Normally I love cartoons, both anime and western, and therefore gave this one a long line before it broke...<br /><br />PDD
