I wasn't familiar with Chris Gardner's story before this movie. I think it's a great story. The struggles he face seem hard to bear. But, believing in himself got him through it. Everyone has that capacity no matter their color, background or religion. Those of you that only see Will Smith as an actor that can only do comedy are sadly mistaken. He will win an award for this role. I'm sure of it. I feel it in my bones...as the old folks use to say. Movie goers need to open their minds to actors or actresses range on screen. Thank God they believe they could do it. Look what Jamie Foxx proved. Who knew Robert De Niro could be so funny. That little Ronnie Howard would grow up to be an award winning director. Maybe, just like Chris Gardner they are able to dream and dream big. To make those dreams come true it takes hard work. My motto is if you're going to dream you might as well dream big. Good luck to this film and all that took part in it.
