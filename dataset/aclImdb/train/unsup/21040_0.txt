I have so many friends who love this movie. I've heard numerous people claim it as one of their favorites. Am I crazy? Am I missing something?... No, I am not crazy. The Boondock Saints is not a movie. Its like a boy band. If it looks like a movie and it sounds like a movie then it must be a movie right? But its not. Its wrong. Its not even an "unwatchably bad" movie like PCU or Mystery Men or Dogma. Its noise. Just noise. It's a nothing. An empty void. To "enjoy" the experience of watching the Boondock Saints is Madness. Astronomically irrelevant like a monkey humping a football unfathomable Madness... and he's making another one.
