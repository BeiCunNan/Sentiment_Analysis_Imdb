The zombie movie seemed to be a thing of the past. Sure they were still making them throughout the 90s, but we didn't really hear about them as much as we did films like Romero's 'Dead' films, the 'Return of the Living Dead' series, and so on. Nothing really new or exciting was being done with the concept. One place where it was really kept alive was in the world of video games, including one Resident Evil. Having only played the game once or twice myself I didn't know how to feel about a film adaptation. I mean let's be honest, few films based on these games get it right. Sure the Mario Brothers movie is fun in a so-bad-it's-good way, but was it really satisfying? I guess that depends on the viewer. Anyway, thanks to this movie the zombie subgenre was hot again.<br /><br />Pros: A tense, terrifying opening sequence. Writer/director Anderson gives us a film that's a visual feast due to it's slickness, his use of blue lights, slow motion, etc. A cool electronic score. Moves at a brisk pace. All around, the performances are pretty good. Good special, make-up, and visual effects. At least a couple good scares. Some awesome set pieces; my personal favorite being the one involving lasers. Amazing production design.<br /><br />Cons: Fans of zombie movies may bit disappointed that it takes a while for the walking cadavers to show up and wreak havoc. Aside from some original touches, this film is fairly derivative of other zombie, action, and science fiction films.<br /><br />Final thoughts: This modern zombie flick is a whole new dimension. Back in the day it was either a chemical spill or voodoo curse that raised the dead. But this is like a Romero zombie movie with a futuristic twist. This may have been the start of a new type of zombie film.<br /><br />My rating: 4/5
