I gave this film a 2, only because there was an effort made to make a film and because it seems that the actor that played Eban, has some talent.<br /><br />The film was terrible. The script seemed to be written by a teenager who was in love with a guy in his twenties. It was extremely predictable, slow, boring and unoriginal. It looked like a home movie shot on video with the neighbors as actors. It seems like the simplistic fantasies of a teenager filled with cliche.<br /><br />There are many other films which deal with this subject matter and worlds apart in quality. Start with "For a lost soldier".<br /><br />My apologies to the filmmaker(s) for such a harsh review. My advice if they are interested: get audience feedback once you've got a starting cut of a film, then go to work and make it better before you send it out for the world to condemn it.
