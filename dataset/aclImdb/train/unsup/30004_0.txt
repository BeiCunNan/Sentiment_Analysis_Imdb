Beatrice Lillie plays a somewhat dim but likable lady who works for a traveling repertory company. She does all the grunt work and occasionally fills in for small roles. Although she envisions playing the lead (the "vamp"), in truth she's not very competent and has a hard enough time with her own job.<br /><br />A bit later, a nice young man (Jack Pickford) joins the company and Beatrice is smitten. He likes her as well, but for her it's "love at first sight". The reason Jack joined them is that he was framed--accused of embezzling money from the bank in which he worked. Later, when the company goes to the town where Jack was from, he hides because he doesn't want to get caught. And Beatrice gives it her all to prove Jack's innocence.<br /><br />The film is a light comedy-romance, though it is much more a comedy--with Beatrice sometimes hamming it up and other times doing a good job of playing this ditsy character. It's pretty likable but also rather insignificant--worth seeing, but not a film you should rush to see.<br /><br />A few observations about several of the actors. This is Franklin Pangborn's first movie and he plays a very effeminate wimp who also happens to play the rugged hero in the company. The film was shown as part of Turner Classic Movie's salute to gay images in film. He's pretty good in this role and I doubt if gay people would be particularly offended by his role. Also, this is Jack Pickford's second to last film. This ill-fated screw-up was the brother of Mary Pickford and by the early 30s and had a significant career in acting, although a combination of hard living, alcohol and STDs brought his life to an early end. What a shame. Also, while Beatrice Lillie had a long and remarkable career on stage, she made very, very few films so this is a rare opportunity to see her in action.
