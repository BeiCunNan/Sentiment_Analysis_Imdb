I've seen every Ma and Pa Kettle film made because I long to be as stoic, calm and unperplexed as was Percy Kilbride, so this film was doubly enjoyable because also I've always been a big Jack Benny fan due to the fact he had the best timing, on radio, TV and movies, of any comedian.<br /><br />Regarding the storyline,I'm not writing to spoon feed anyone;you can read it for yourselves but I am stating that when it next pops up on Turner,take a peek. Benny plays off Percy; Percy plays off Benny and Ann Sheridan adds a touch of beauty but according to the plot, not brains. And Charles Coburn whom everybody loved (how can anyone dislike Charles Coburn?) lends an air of royalty and connivery to the madcap happenings.<br /><br />For a pleasant,entertaining and funny romp through cellulod,"GWSH" is very worthwhile.
