Flat, uninteresting characters and a poor attention to the supposed documentary style made this the worst use of my movie rental dollars in a while. Where 'The Blair Witch Project' drew me in and ably created the atmosphere of immersion, 'The Last Broadcast' improperly used shots from impossible camera angles (there are several shots in the ending where the only people present are in the frame and the camera placement was improbable for the story), ruining the illusion of the 'documentary'. Technical gaffs abound in the internet sequences and in the restoration of a video frame from static to perfect picture upon which the ending relies.
