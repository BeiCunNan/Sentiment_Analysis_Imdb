An lonely bright young teenager by the name of Heather Fasulo (Agnes Bruckner) is been sent to the Falburn Academy. Which it is all-girls boarding school. Punished by her parents (Bruce Campbell and Emma Campbell) to be sent there. Heather is been watched by the mysterious headmistress Ms. Traverse and her disturbing menacing staff. But Heather isn't like the other girls-She hears voices. Heather knows, there's nothing what it's seems at this academy. When several students has been disappearing into the forest. There's an horrifying secret waiting to be uncover and there's no escape from this seemingly innocent academy.<br /><br />Directed by Lucky McKee (May) made an interesting horror fantasy with fine performances by Bruckner and Clarkson. This was made for theaters but released to DVD instead. But this film did play in the fantasy/horror film festivals before being released to DVD. Although this picture has some originality, "The Woods" has echoes to Dario Argento's Suspiria. Probably one of the few problems of this movie, that there's hardly any scares.<br /><br />DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Sadly this underrated film doesn't have any features. Originally this DVD was supposed to have features like Commentaries Tracks, Deleted Scenes and Featurettes. Hopefully in a future DVD, we should get this features with enough support from fans of this film. This picture has good cinematography by John R. Leonetti (Detroit Rock City, The Mask, Mortal Kombat) and an fine music score by John Frizzell (Alien Resurrection, Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, Dante's Peak). This well made film is certainly worth a look. Super 35. (*** 1/2 out of *****).
