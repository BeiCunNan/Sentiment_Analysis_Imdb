Taking some chapter headings from the book by David Reubens, this is a lighthearted and often hilarious look at some aspects of the world's favourite hobby. Once again, Woody Allen directs, writes and stars (though not in every section).<br /><br />Not for the easily offended, this may seem tame by modern standards but it's still quite enjoyably racy adult comedy. We get such varied sketches (and they ARE sketches in feel and structure, for my money) as a court jester trying to seduce a queen and being hampered by a chastity belt, a doctor (Gene Wilder, in top form) falling for a sheep, an amorous Italian couple who find that the woman can only be sexually satisfied . . . in certain conditions, a middle-aged transvestite taking quite a risk, a panel show asking the panel to guess someone's perversion, a hilarious mad scientist skit (featuring the great John Carradine) and the workings of a sexual encounter from inside the body.<br /><br />Where else could you see a man being chased by a 40000X lone breast? Where else would you laugh at Gene Wilder's growing affection for lambswool sweaters? Indeed, what other movie features a rabbi being lightly flogged and scolded while his wife sits by his feet and eats pork? It's a movie full of unique, bizarre moments but it's also full of some more great zingers in the script department too.<br /><br />Some people complain that the movie is inconsistent and too patchy. On the contrary, I personally find it consistently hilarious (even the untranslated Italian sketch is great to view as a homage to that style of film-making) and think it deserves to be rated as highly as Allen's other comedies from this era. And hey, it has Burt Reynolds in there for no real reason . . . . . . but you get to smile and think "ha, there's Burt Reynolds".<br /><br />See this if you like: Sleeper, Bananas, Take The Money And Run.
