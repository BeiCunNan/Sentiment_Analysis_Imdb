When this movie was released I thought that being a fan of the comic books (as almost every other spaniard) I would be disappointed. Months went by and one day my husband rented it. To my surprise, the movie was hilarious and it recreated the weird Mortadelo and Filemon's world very well. When the movie ended we both agreed we had to watch it again to be able to get the million things that happened at the same time on the screen. Just like in the comic books.<br /><br />To me, the highlights of this movie are, and not in this exact order, the cast and the script. I thought it was impossible to find someone to play Mortadelo that really looked like Mortadelo, or that Berta Ojea could make such a great Ofelia.<br /><br />The movie is so weird and so surrealistic that I don't think everybody would like it. But if you like that kind of humor, go rent it.
