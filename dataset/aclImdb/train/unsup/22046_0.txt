Though this story is certainly somewhat "predictable", it lets all of its viewers have a feel for something which of late seems almost elusive. That"something" is PERSONAL INTEGRITY. Can you find that much maligned virtue INTEGRITY in places such as Washington D.C., the realm of professional sports, the local street corner where minors are victimized by drug dealers or even in personal lives which seem to be foundering too much of the time?<br /><br />Somebody once suggested that "virtue is its own reward". This story certainly and eventually heaps rightful rewards on those who make their choices either out of selfishness or integrity. Each of the characters subtly adds a contribution to this tale of love and persistence. And they collide in the scenic Irish arena of the early 1940's when the world was about to change forever.In the end, we are reminded that values are either good or bad and somehow bring conflict and eventual resolution. Good does not always triumph over evil.This simple but enticing story reminds all that there is a difference between them and no one goes on without being affected by whatever choices people will make.
