The story of Terry fox has to be one of few Canadian stories worthy of cinema. In this second attempt at capturing not only one of Canada's greatest stories, but one of the world's greatest stories on film, CTV rushed out a made for TV abomination. Fresh on the heels of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's "Greatest Canadian" program which reminded Canadians of Terry's remarkable story, "Terry" offers nothing more than an amateur re-staging of documented events. Although lacking the necessary maturity, Ashmore's detailed and strong performance is not enough to save a script that offers nothing more to the televised events every Canadian knows. What was he like as a physically-abled youth? What was it like for him to discover he had cancer? What was that like for his family? What was it like to experience amputation? What drove him past potential depression through to being the most inspirational Canadian...ever? I don't know. I wish I did. Instead I learned that computers have the ability to make an actor with two legs look like he only has one. Good for you computers. Good for you.
