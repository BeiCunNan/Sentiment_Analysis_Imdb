I don't think anyone who watches this movie or who actually pays attention to the world around them would argue that Fox News is truly "fair and balanced." This documentary sets out to prove in numerous ways how Fox News is a well rehearsed, talking-points-fed propaganda arm for the right wing.<br /><br />The problem is not with the message but with the film-making. This movie is a glorified Power Point presentation. And thats putting it nicely. Most of the footage from Fox News is not even taken from broadcast quality sources but rather DVRs and clips from the internet. It looks and sounds HORRIBLE. The graphics (which is the bulk of the movie) are cheap, tacky, cheesy, and totally lessen the impact of the important points that are often being made.<br /><br />I realize that those on the fringe, seeking change are not very popular and thus won't have millions to make a glossy movie. But that does not mean that if you take your time, plan, and above all be creative, you can't make a good movie. And thats the problem, this movie is all message and no craft. And to me, that sort of negates the purpose of documentaries. Because if it was ONLY about the message, then write an editorial in a major newspaper. Documentary film-making is about combining message and style, and using the two to heighten and sharpen one another. None of that happens here. I made stuff in high school with fart jokes in it shot on VHS that was better than this.
