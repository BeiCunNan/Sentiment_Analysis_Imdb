How do you get your roommate to commit suicide? That was the plot of this movie. Here's a suggestion- Make them watch this movie more than once. Tom Everett Scott is capable of so much more than this crap, but I expected as much from Mark-Paul Gosselar, who graced us with 10 years of Zack Morris. The central problem in this movie is that it's bad from the start, the whole idea is pointless. You cannot gain sympathy for a character who is trying to kill another innocent person. This movie starts nowhere, gets nowhere, and takes 94 minutes doing so. Its futile attempt at comedy leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth, simply because the jokes are all old and recycled. There is the obligitory drug use, giant bongs, etc...There is the romantic sub-plot that REALLY goes nowhere. There is the overly dramatic caffeine beer drug laced student tirades that leave you wondering, are there any Teachers at this college? Nothing about this movie is fresh or original, nothing about this movie is funny, nothing about this movie makes it worth watching. Rent Animal House instead, even if you've seen it 20 times before, it's better than this! And to see a GOOD job of acting by Tom Everett Scott, rent That Thing You Do.
