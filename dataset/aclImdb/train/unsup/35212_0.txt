this film is so bad i find it hard to describe to other people, so I end up showing them leaving them speechless! I have seen this awful film far to many times now.<br /><br />it has no relevance to the first one. NOT EVEN ANY TROLLS TO BE SEEN. JUST GOBLINS<br /><br />Bad cast, acting, plot, effects just everything.<br /><br />you Will have to watch this for yourself to truly believe that a film like this can be made by people over the age of two.<br /><br />However saying all this it is strangely watchable for its sheer awfulness
