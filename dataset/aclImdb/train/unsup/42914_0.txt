the plot is thin, very thin, the actors leave much to be desired, but then it gets worst at the end it starts a huge mumbo jumbo about religion that sounds like an "eat this lollypop and be cool" propaganda except its not propaganda its religion .<br /><br />i say watch this movie and see how bad it gets and how pathetic religion is even spoils a movie that should be about fighting bugs -_-x<br /><br />anywya its a horrible movie i expected more but even casper van dien coming back to his former role didn't do it for me, i mean he says the well known phrase " you wana live forever" in the most terrible time and in a way that he seems to be making fun of the movie...<br /><br />but don't think its that bad its actually worst.. just watch it so you know how the director completely failed to criticise religion + dictatorship control instead it looks like propaganda.
