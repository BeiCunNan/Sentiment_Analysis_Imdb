First this movie isn't at all for kids.<br /><br />Next, this movie isn't a movie at all, it must be just a practice or a draft. There's a lot of unexplained blood and violence in this movie, and confusion/unknown responses to these actions.<br /><br />And lastly, this by far is one (if not THE) of the worst movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />If you are looking for a bad movie to laugh at how bad it is, then you may want to watch this one.<br /><br />I was playing my Game Boy after 15-20 minutes in the film and was shocked to see the ton of sudden blood in a few of the scenes. <br /><br />Lastly, the only reason why this film gets a 1, is because they are after some rare diamond (although the plot is still pathetic) and the beginning titles was actually decent (like showing the 7 ninjas individually).
