Glad to see that I'm not the only one who was in this movie/invested in it that has never seen a dime for it. I was in this movie as well, I won't say who I played, but the best thing is to try to make it a drinking game, that's what I did with my friends when they insisted on seeing it. Honestly, the original script was better than what this turned out to be. I still can't believe that someone is out there distributing the movie, I mean it's even up for rent on Netflix! Oh, and one little discrepancy with IMDb, the movie was only distributed (who knew, not me definitely) in 1993, it was actually made in 1987 or 1988. Oh well, even though I signed on to be in a quaint little comedy I wound up being in a schlocky horror movie. Chock it up as something to tell my kids.
