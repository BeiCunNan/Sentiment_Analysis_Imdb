Pulling all my punches would still brutalize this film to no end. The mere breath of common sense causes this film to topple, whimper, and crumble to dust.<br /><br />This film lacks nearly every quality a decent movie requires. Scene transition, dialogue, music, chemistry, convincing actors and characters, a budget.<br /><br />This movie cost a mere $100k to make, which would be fine, I love independents and low budget films - if they have any redeeming qualities, but The Vault does not. <br /><br />Attack of the Killer Tomatoes had more convincing character development and dialogue, and I do mean the tomatoes. I just hope the filmmakers can come up with a better script because this formulaic an d amateur film lacked in so many areas. I truly felt my IQ lowering the longer I watched it.
