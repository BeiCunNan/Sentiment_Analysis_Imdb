I picked this up on DVD under the title "Return of the Bastards" (in Greek, with English subtitles). It is either a shockingly inept piece of trash, or a brilliant parody of trash movies in general. What to expect: overexposed photography, lame fight scenes, non-existent "acting" (it should really be called "line-reading", because it's nothing more than that), ludicrous sound effects, fake gore and a plot lifted wholesale from "Marathon Man" with Laurence Olivier and Dustin Hoffman!!! I'm not kidding - they even included the famous "is it safe?" scene! I give this film 0 stars because it is truly terrible in every possible category, but that doesn't mean it's not fun to watch. For maximum laughs, probably best seen with an audience.
