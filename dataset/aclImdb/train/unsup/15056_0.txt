This film was one of Luis Llosa's early ventures in Hollywood, and Luana Anders last as a writer. It follows photo-journalist R.J.O'Brien (Craig Sheffer), who is jailed by corrupt South American police while investigating the murder of an environmental activist, being released when rain forest activist Alyssa (Sandra Bullock) kindly tells the police he is harmless.<br /><br />I don't know how to describe the film except it has such a lazy feel to it. When the Indian that R.J. was jailed with supposedly confesses to the murder R.J. believes he was framed, and when the Indian is found hanged in his cell R.J. and Alyssa decide to dig deeper, though Alyssa is less than impressed with R.J.'s behaviour to this point. R.J. redeems himself a touch by charging in to a burning hut to save a young boy, who is resuscitated by Alyssa, and having a burning ember on his shirt gives R.J. an excuse to turf it and show some muscle to Alyssa, who promptly cries on his shoulder. Feeling the answer lies with the hanged Indian's tribe they paddle up river into the jungle, unaware that the real murderer is stalking them until R.J. gets shot, but they escape to Indian territory where they are stalked again, and R.J. yells loudly while trying to lose them. The Indians turn out friendly and pass around some "feel good" potion by the fire which drives R.J. and Alyssa to get naked and quench their desire. Continuing to enjoy mixing pleasure with business R.J. returns to his hotel with Alyssa, but before they can continue their newfound romance in the hotel room the police ambush R.J. in his room, beating him up and leaving him tied to a chair with a time bomb at his feet. Alyssa arrives at his door, against instructions from her boss, just in time to untie him and they escape once again, but when they run to Alyssa's boss for help they find that she too is on the take and it seems that the happy duo are now left to bring the story to its conclusion by themselves.
