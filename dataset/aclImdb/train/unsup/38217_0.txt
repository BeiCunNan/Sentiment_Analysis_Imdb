I wanted to watch this movie, since I saw the categorization "Genre: Thriller / Mystery / Sci-Fi", and a decent 5.8 rating and thought it might be good. However that categorization and rating is very misleading it turned out.<br /><br />I started to watch this movie, and sat through the first 48 minutes of it, hoping it would eventually get interesting. Sadly it never did, so I stopped right there.<br /><br />The main flaw of the movie is that the pace is extremely slow, and the lack of any interesting plot. It definitely do not deserve to be in the "Thriller" category, there is nothing thrilling about it at all(the first 48 minutes anyway, doubt the second half gets any better..).<br /><br />If I had to give this movie any sort of label, it would have to be "Genre: slow-paced wannabe pseudo-intellectual sci-fi", and would recommend you avoid it at all cost, unless you need something to doze off to.
