When more than one writer is credited with a script, chances are the movie stinks. As if he knew this, the director had Bob and Bing breaking the fourth wall, and throwing in stuff that did nothing except bog the "story" down. It was the cinematic equivalent of watching a doctor desperately trying to revive a patient who is D.O.A.<br /><br />It was creepy that women young enough to be their daughters throw themselves at the boys. Indeed, the sexism and racism here is despicable! Were Bob's and Bing's egos' that fragile or that inflated? I couldn't decide which.<br /><br />How was it that the natives spoke perfect, unaccented English? Where did they get their fine clothes and jewels? How did they build that mansion? Bob, Bing, and Dorothy land on a supposedly deserted island, but spend the night in the swankiest hut ever built, and Dorothy romps in a man-made lagoon the next morning! Why did they throw in the tiger and the gorilla? How did Dorothy's evil cousin wind up where she wound up? Then, because the film makers ran out of ideas (not that they had any to begin with), they pull an Irwin Allen, and have a volcano erupt! Ninety minutes of torture, and our trio never do get to Bali (why they had to get to Bali is never explained). Instead, Bing, Dorothy, and Jane Russell (don't ask) walk toward a yacht anchored in the harbor (don't ask) as Bob frantically tries to stop the "movie" from ending (don't ask).<br /><br />Avoid this like the plague. Your brain cells will thank you.
