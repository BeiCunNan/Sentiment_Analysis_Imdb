The premise of the movie was okay (and I did enjoy fast-forwarding to see how they worked the Dickens parallels in) but the main character (Connor Mead, played by Matthew McConaughey) might as well have been on the Lucy Show for how many terrible, awful, irredeemable things he did. It made the entire movie SO annoying.<br /><br />I also didn't enjoy how vapid most of the female characters were, or the idea that anybody and everybody would fall into bed with such a sleazebucket. He just wasn't attractive, to be honest. Daniel Sunjata's character was 100 times more interesting.<br /><br />Jennifer Garner, Breckin Meyers and Michael Douglas were all fine, but not enough to salvage an otherwise really unpleasant movie.
