Even without mystery science theater this one would still be full of laughs. It starts with a professor of some sort explaining all this theories of what is in the center of the earth, and boy are they not even close to the truth. Then you meet the troops as John Agar and the Beaver's dad and the rest of the team are doing research on artifacts. They find something that prompts them to climb the mountain and then one of the men falls down a hole so you get to watch men climbing down a hole for a good ten minutes. Then they get trapped and stumble upon an ancient civilization underground ruled by white elves in dumb costumes. Of course the logic in this movie is a bit suspect as the men probably didn't go down more than a hundred feet and they were on a mountain so I doubt the place could have been as big as made out to be. The mole people look especially stupid, but at least there clothes look more normal than the elves. And the one seen where the elf people are whipping the mole men does sort of make you wanna sing that old Devo song. And watch for the old man who does nothing, but slow Agar and the Beaver's dad down with his constant whinning.
