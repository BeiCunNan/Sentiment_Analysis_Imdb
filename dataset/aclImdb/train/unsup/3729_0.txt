In one word bizarre. I can't think of any TV series stranger in a bad way. A robotic dog who fights bad guys, yes you heard me. Top that off with a theme song and opening that will have you on the floor laughing (think Wonder Woman opening meets robotic dog). Top it all off with suspense that never starts and aghh. If your a fan of bad television, I mean the stuff that's so bad its funny, well this is the show for you, run to your nearest library or video store and pick it up. If you're a fan of doctor who that thinks this looks interesting don't waste your time.
