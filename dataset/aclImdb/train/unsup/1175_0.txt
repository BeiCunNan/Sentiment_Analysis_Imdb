I wish I could find this on DVD, I saw it in 1995 when it was shown on public T.V. and was blown away. The choice of musicians for the individual songs is masterful. Nick Cave gives a deliciously creepy take on Mac The Knife, Elvis Costello breathes a wavering pathos into Lost in the Stars, and Charlie Haydon's Speak Low is one of the few instrumental pieces that can bring me to tears. The CD is available on Amazon.com and I highly recommend it. I would comment on the ignorance of the user who complained about this being about "some German guy" but its obvious that person was far out of his depth musically and culturally.
