Stephen Baldwin, futuristic convict (but he's actually an excessively good guy) gets abandoned on a desolate planet by the futuristic prison people. . . .meets beautiful woman (Lisa Bonet) with cute child in tow. . .desert pirates who repeat cliché bad-guy talk and do cliché bad-guy things, etc., etc. Sorry I couldn't finish this one to give more info(gave it about 45 minutes) due to the boringness. <br /><br />I gave this movie three stars just because the actors make a concerted effort but even they can't save it. Formulaic, predictable (oh so predictable!), recycled story and dialog, etc. Bad movie. . . . .bad, bad, BAD movie!
