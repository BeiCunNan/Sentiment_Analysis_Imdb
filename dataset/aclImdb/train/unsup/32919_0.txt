I've seen bad movies, and I thought I saw the worst in "Air Marshall," and couldn't imagine a movie worse. Boy was I wrong. "Pacific Heights" is totally absurd and frustrating. I stopped this movie after the police paid a visit. I tell you, if this is California law, I never want to move to California. I've watched enough People's Court to know nothing in this movie makes sense. Yes, it was against the law for him to shut off power and heat; that much is true. The officer said, "Whether he has a lease or not, he's still a tenant." Absurd. If there is no lease, he is trespassing. He has a right to change the locks? Who owns the building? The tenant? He doesn't own the place. He's renting the apartment. The landlord has a right to enter the apartment in case of an emergency or to do repairs or any number of reasons since he owns the building. Changing the locks is illegal. Drake has a right to start eviction proceedings. No rent has been paid. Keaton admits there was a problem with the money. Go to Small Claims Court. You don't have to mess with attorneys. There's landlord/tenant court, go through evictions. And the potential tenants' comments about refusing to authorize a credit check is enough to make my skin crawl. "It's not necessary, " he says, "My credit is good." I'd say, "Well, then there's nothing for you to worry about." I've seen enough episodes of "Cops" that you don't know who you'll meet, and I don't think anyone truly believes that no one ever lies. This movie really insults my intelligence. This is the biggest piece of crap I've ever seen. Avoid this movie at all costs.
