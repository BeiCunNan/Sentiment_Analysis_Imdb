********** Many Spoilers, Many Flaws *************** The premise of the movie is a Border Patrol agent, Norton, isn't too fond of illegal aliens and kills one. Pete, the title character's slaughtered friend, finds out its Norton and takes him and the body on a journey to bury him in Estrada's home village.<br /><br />Problem: The killing was just a bad accident. Its pretty apparent the agent had remorse but panicked and hid the deed along with his Border Agent buddies. The Border Patrol are portrayed as two dimensional bumbling racists while the Mexicans are kindhearted, trying to survive. Although Hollywood wants you to believe in the dignity of their fellow man there is none for the Border Patrol. Norton is never really given a chance to explain what happened to Pete.<br /><br />Problem: The promise that Estrada makes Pete keep in the event of his death is based on a lie that cheapens the characters involved and doesn't make sense. My guess it pushes the movie over the 1:30 mark.<br /><br />Problem: There is multiple POV versions of a couple of scenes that don't really differ. I'm tired of this cinema trick and its useless here except to push the movie over 1:30.<br /><br />Best Part: Levon Helm as the blind hermit. This is BY FAR the best and most "insightful" part of the movie. Dwight Yoakum's performance is also good but Levon steals the movie.<br /><br />BIG Problem: Tommy Lee Jones has no range. He has an unsympathetic constant deadpan delivery. Shouldn't be allowed to carry a movie.<br /><br />Wait for it to come out on video. Finally, for those who hype the "new Western" such as this film and Brokeback Mountain, rent "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance." This shows real conflict, heroism, friendship and sacrifice. Also, "Shane" for the breathtaking scenery.
