The storyline of this movie is very ordinary and hard to believe in. Also, while showing the time lapse the director has neither taken enough care to show the discoloration of or changes in the sets used on the location, nor has he changed the make-ups of different actors who have aged by at least 10 years. The songs have just been inserted to 'showcase' the acrobatic 'talent' of one of the lead actresses. A repetition of such showcasing has made the movie very boring. The acting and dialog delivery of many actors does not seem to come out naturally, but rather seems to be forced out. Enough attention has not been given while writing the screenplay which has made it a very slow-moving storyline.
