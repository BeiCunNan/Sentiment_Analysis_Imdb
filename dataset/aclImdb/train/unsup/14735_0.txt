I'm quite frankly bewildered and saddened by some of the negative reactions, both from movie goer's and critics, with regards to Aaja Nachle. Many people expected, for the return of Madhuri Dixit to films, that Yash Raj would have created some huge spectacular epic full of pomp, color and costumes. But that simply isn't Madhuri's style now. It was a script she approved because she felt it was most like her life now. And she chose well.<br /><br />Frankly, the movie is perfect for her. The dancing reflects all of Madhuri's abilities as a dancer, from classical Indian styles to modern. She dances better than ever here. Is the script original? Absolutely not, but critics of this movie have conveniently forgotten that most Hindi films do not have scripts that are particularly original. Aaja Nachle is simply a movie that every country in the world who produces films has made at one point or another. The "underdog" takes on the government/the bad guy/the evil ruler, overcomes a lot of obstacles, and wins the day (and usually the heart of the people or someone else). The difference here is that Madhuri, the lead actor, doesn't end up with a romance at the end (though we get the future possibility). Madhuri, like Juhi Chawla and other Indian actresses who are over 40 and married, realize that they can no longer "run around trees" believably like their younger counterparts. So a role such as this is perfect for Madhuri. The problems/flaws of this script shouldn't unfairly rest upon her shoulders.<br /><br />What people also forget is the wonderful ensemble cast this movie has. I throughly enjoyed their stories and personal relationships and problems: corrupt politicians, a best friend held back by her husband, a boring man who wants more spark in his love live, the angry young man who finally learns what love is, and the young woman who learns what depths love can take her to. It's the solid characterization that this movie has that makes it engaging. Not elaborate costumes or big musical production numbers.<br /><br />That having been said, the musical numbers, particularly the play-within-the-movie run the gamut from being fun to beautiful to heart breaking. I was particularly struck by one song not on the soundtrack, "Ishq Ishq". Madhuri's dancing in this is both modern and reminiscent of a worshipful devotee. Breathtaking.<br /><br />Ignore the naysayers. Notice that most of the people here actually liked the film. Don't expect some elaborate script or huge costumed melodrama like "Devdas." It is what it is: a feel-good movie with a wonderful cast and the return of the Queen of Hindi cinema doing exactly what she does best. May this not be her last film.
