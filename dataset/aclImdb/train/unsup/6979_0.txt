When I was about to watch this film, I didn't really know what to expect from it. I didn't really know what it was all about, and I wasn't familiar with French avant-garde movies or the work of Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet. But it was an instant delight. It's not at all gruesome even if the plot is about cannibalism, and it's so comprehensible. It's such a good movie that I don't know how to explain why. It's so funny, well-directed, lovable, whatever. It's just a real delightful movie. And I love the 2 leads, Julie and Louison, especially when they played music together. Speaking of music, I even remember just how good the score was, too.<br /><br />
