Nobody should have to sit through this. Who are the jokers that gave this a 10? Stupid premise, unsatisfying conclusion. The only thing this has going for it is the gorgeous breasts.<br /><br />Minor spoiler:<br /><br />My favorite part: when the ship course is changed, and the people on the bridge get thrown all over by the abrupt directional/speed variation while the characters all over the rest of the ship are completely unaware anything had happened.
