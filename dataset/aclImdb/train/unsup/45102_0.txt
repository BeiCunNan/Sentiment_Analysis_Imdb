This movie has a lot of promise. It failed. I love a movie where Tori Spelling just looks beautiful, yet does not speak. She is so magnetically attractive. Yet---she speaks. Speaking is a bad habit for little old Tori. I guess Tori Spelling is the female version of Tom Cruise. This movie is a sorry mess, where an actor who just yells is given more than twenty minutes of screen time: namely Croaker. The lead actor, what's his name, the loser/fry cook, is actually interesting. Also, Dietrich Bader, provides acting ability, otherwise absent from this movie. Bader is far superior to this mess. This is a goofy movie that fails to be goofy. It is a failure. Michael Weston, the fry cook/loser, is acceptably good enough as the 20-something guy. The amateur acting throughout this film is not acceptable. This kind of movie-making actually vaulted the series Star Trek to fame. I am cool with that.
