This film is superb, miss it at your peril.<br /><br />Me and my Brother watched this together and the first words that came out of our mouths at the credits was "that was brilliant".<br /><br />The forward inertia the film is excellent, it's one of those films that builds up and up but unlike other movies, does not fail to disappoint at the climax.<br /><br />The film is also laced with some classic dialogue, such as:<br /><br />After Richard has stolen the drugs and is sitting with Anthony at the farm... (Summarised)<br /><br />Richard, "F*ck it, I'll stick the lot in." Anthony, "Whoahh, that's acid, what are you gonna do with it?" Richard, "I'm gonna give them a super-duper f*cking dose man, I'm gonna send them to space man, but this spaceship ain't f*cking coming back though baby".<br /><br />...<br /><br />Another quality line is when he has one of the three dweebs drugged up...<br /><br />Richard, "You don't know who I am do ya?" Dweeb, "Can I go home?" Richard, "Ohhh your going." Dweeb, "Are you going home?" Richard, "You're f*cking going mate, just stand there mate, don't you move, I'm gonna shut you off man"<br /><br />an outstanding gritty film, makes me proud to be English.<br /><br />McGeezer
