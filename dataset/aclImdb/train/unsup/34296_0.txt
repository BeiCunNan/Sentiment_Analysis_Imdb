The only reason I am giving a 2 is because some of the actors managed to pull through the script.How they managed half of these scenes without bursting into hysterical laughter is beyond me. They at least held up on their end of the bargain.So, where to start. I wasn't expecting much on a direct-to-DVD movie, but holy sh*t was I in for a crap storm tonight. The first boogeyman sucked, no denying. So, to remedy the problem, looks like cues were taken from other horror films * cough cough SAW, and infused with a special spoonful of terrible. Seeing people die in the most disgusting ways was a reminder about what crap costs these days. $5.34 at your local blockbuster. PASS!!!
