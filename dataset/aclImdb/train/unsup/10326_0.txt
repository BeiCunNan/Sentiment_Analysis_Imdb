I just saw this movie this afternoon and really enjoyed it. Was anyone else taken back a little by the change from French to English and then back to French without any notice. The first time it happened, I was very surprised. Why do you think that was done? I don't see any purpose The only time, it made sense to me was when she was teaching and reading from an English novel, otherwise, it didn't make sense in other places. Any comment? Excellent movie, I will recommend it to friends and try to see a few more Charlotte Rampling movies. It is a snowy day here and so this movie went very well with our weather. Can anyone recommend any other Charlotte Rampling movies? I would definitely like to see something else that she has starred in. Does she do both French and British movies?
