I always loved Conan! He is so different from Leno, Fergunson, Kimmel, Fallon, Letterman,... He is absolutely and extremely funny! He cracks me up every time. I love his monologue, his comical bits and his interviews. Max Weinberg and his "gang" are better than ever. And I really like Andy Richter. Some of the new bits are not that effective like the Twitter Tracker or the TMZ Zoo. The Paris Hilton appearance was not funny or enjoyable. A dark moment, indeed.<br /><br />Overall, it's still good old Conan! He is fitting just fine. The crazy hair is back so... be cool my babies!<br /><br />10/10 (Or is it?)
