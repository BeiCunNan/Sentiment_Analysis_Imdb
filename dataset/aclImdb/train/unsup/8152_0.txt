I only recently found out about this movie thanks to ITV screening it. As it was on during the early hours, I set the video to record it and was pleased I did. <br /><br />A group of smugglers are 'haunting' a castle, which happens to be haunted anyway by a monk. One of the smugglers poses as this monk and frightens some of the locals. A reporter and his girlfriend decide to investigate this and discover these smugglers are importing parts to build an atomic bomb which could course great loss of life and destruction over a large area. They get arrested at the end.<br /><br />This movie also gives you an idea on what life was like during the 1950's including a village fete which were popular at the time and still are today.<br /><br />The nuclear jitters of the time probably spawned the movie, which was made at the height of the Atomic Age.<br /><br />As well as Jimmy Hanley, it also stars Lionel Jefferies (Chitty Chitty Bang Bang) and Carry On star Kenneth Conner. All play good parts. The movie has a great theme and score too.<br /><br />This movie is worth watching if you get the chance as it is rather hold to get hold of.<br /><br />Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.
