Another world exists, and we are given a glimpse into that world: where sons beat their mothers, fathers are attracted to their daughters, and random strangers take up residence in a home and begin to run the household as they see fit. This is the world of "Visitor Q".<br /><br />I've been on something of a Takashi Miike kick lately, thoroughly enjoying "Audition" recently. He's more offbeat and push-the-envelope than much of what passes for horror in America. This film is no exception. While the violence is much less than I've seen from Miike, the bizarre sexual aspects are pushed to new limits.<br /><br />I don't know what I can write here without being obscene, but it's hard to describe this film without at least mentioning a few of the extreme sexual cases presented: incest, necrophilia, sex with feces, a woman who enjoys making herself lactate until she's flooded the room. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. If you're looking for something weird, this is your best bet. The only film that comes close to being this strange is "Slaughtered Vomit Dolls", which is more gross and artistic than this -- this film is just weird in general.<br /><br />So, how do you judge a film that's bizarre? As art? Because the plot is really hard to pin down (not much happens, and the visitor is never explained). The acting is amazing, at least as far as they really pulled off the dark humor (I think most people will miss the fact this is supposed to be funny, but you can tell the violence is exaggerated on purpose). I really liked it, if for no other reason than that every time I thought it couldn't get weirder, I was wrong.<br /><br />If you watch the opening scene and don't mind what you see, watch this film. I was uncertain at the beginning because the use of video quality made it seem all too real. But after the initial shock faded, I really few in love with this family and wanted to know what was going on. Not sure I understand it, but that just leaves me wanting to see it again. So, yeah, if you're into bizarre films or Miike (or both), put this on the top of your list!
