Stienbeck's classic is given it's first big screen adaption and Lon Chaney Jr gives the best performance of his career.<br /><br />Of Mice and Men is a great novel to begin with and the problem with it is that it would be a hard novel to adapt in Depression era 30's. The movie is more up beat than the 1992 version but it benefits because this version is more real than the Sinise film. This version has the benefit of being made in the middle of the depression and because of this it has great power to it.<br /><br />Chaney deserves all the praise in the world for his portrayal of the tragic Lenny. This Lenny is easily the most tragic on film. We believe George when he says Lenny is like a big child. Chaney's Lenny is a character who doesn't understand the world around him, Malkovich's Lenny was more corrupted by his surroundings. It's a shame he didn't receive an Oscar nomination for this role. I think that if he had not gone into horror, he could have worked well as a dramatic player.<br /><br />The set design and cinematography are impressive as well. The film has very simple surroundings but simple isn't bad here. We forget Of Mice and Men because we were also introduced to the Land of Oz or the plantations of Gone with the Wind or the Congress in Mr.Smith Goes to Washington, but unlike those pictures the movie relies more so on it's outstanding cast which give this picture more emotional weight.<br /><br />This is the definitive adaptation of Of Mice and Men. The Sinise film is outstanding but it doesn't hold a candle to this masterpiece.
