Guys, I'm sincerely tired of movie industries deciding all children are stupid. I respect children. Children have now been stereotyped as morons who laugh at anything that makes a stupid noise and poop jokes. Now, people may say that this is of their maturity level. Well, of course it is! Only because they've been made to enjoy it by drivel like this. Start your kids out with good films, ageless films that are good for adults and kids. Like Fantastic Mr. Fox, or Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, or anything related to Pixar. Give them a film they won't look back at later on and have to shame themselves for. Deciding your child is going to enjoy any film with animals and farts is what I'd call neglect. So don't come and complain that we're rating this as an adult's film when it isn't, because you rate films on what they're meant to be. This is meant to be a kid's movie. At that, it is insulting to children, assuming they're all complete morons. Please, pick a good film.
