I can't believe that 1000 of my fellow IMDb folk gave this movie a 7 or better. What is wrong with you? This is a terrible movie; if you don't believe me, read the reviews! The dialogue is infantile, the plot ridiculous ( why would Jimmy get 4 other crazy thugs, and split the $50,000., when he do it himself, or just hire one or two of the crazies for a couple of grand?)If you haven't seen it, please don't! I could go on for hours about how bad this movie is, and what a waste of acting talent, but I'll stop now.
