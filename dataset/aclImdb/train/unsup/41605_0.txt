I'm not a huge fan of sketch shows. The UK-wide (and who knows, maybe by now even international) appeal of shows like "Little Britain" and "The Fast Show" are largely lost on me, running with one-joke 'characters' and one-liners ad nauseum. The Kevin and Perry characters, originally from the "Harry Enfield and Chums" sketch show, are no exception - basically a one-joke set-up that 'satirises' Bitish teenage boys. And "K&P Go Large" runs with the one-joke concept full steam ahead.<br /><br />This movie can be summarised with a counter - I lost count of exact numbers through boredom, but let's say "8 erect penis gags, 2 puke gags, 3 graphic slices of toilet humour, 5 'house-shaking-orgasms'"... and you'll get an idea of whether or not this movie is worth an hour and a half of your life. For me, it certainly wasn't! Certainly, sex comedies should be left to the Americans, who produce far funnier material in the "American Pie"s and "Porky's" of this world.<br /><br />The only thing to recommend - for fans of dance/trance music - is the reasonable soundtrack. Many users of the message board here associate this movie with "good British humour". Please, please don't take this as gospel - we Brits CAN make good comedies! I just need to go watch one right now, to erase the horrible memory of "K&P Go Large"...
