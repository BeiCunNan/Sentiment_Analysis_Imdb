OK, this film & story are a bit cheesy, as HP Lovecraft stories tend to be. The dramatic dread his stories are known for has become a very dated storytelling device, but this adaptation was nicely made, and by golly, Dean Stockwell makes it worth seeing. <br /><br />There are a few predictable plot twists, with a decent performance by Sandra Dee. The nurse is played by Talia Shire - it's only her 2nd film, so it's not her greatest performance, but hey... and this was also notable as one of Ed Begley Sr.'s last films. <br /><br />But Dean is truly the star. His creepy intensity is at once funny & intriguing, but completely memorable. The location was also memorable, but the sound staged sets were a bit weak.<br /><br />There are horror films that have been made with MUCH larger budgets that are not even half as entertaining as this. You really must see this film.
