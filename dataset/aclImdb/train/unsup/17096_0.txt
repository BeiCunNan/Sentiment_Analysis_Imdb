I've been waiting for the moment when I'd finally see the third installment of the Crow saga. The moment came last night; and I must say that it might not be he best movie ever, but it was worth the waiting and the time spent in seeing it. I felt I was back into the dark, windy world to which the crow brings those troubled souls to "put wrong things right".<br /><br />Another thing I'd like to comment is that (and kill me if you want, How do you kill someone who's already dead) I actually liked the Crow:City of Angels, and that I found this movie not better than its predecessor but different. It has a different mood, a different tone and a different feeling. This one has more action but is not as violent. And again, Eric mabius is not a better crow than Vincent Perez, it is just different. His character is more direct and he is not afraid to kill innocent people for his purpose, as opposite of the other two.<br /><br />Scars instead of paint, and the poetic quotations are missing, I liked that, that makes the motivation of the character more visceral and organic and painful; a way to drag his sacrifice as a reminder. And of course, a guy who's here for a purpose and won't leave until it's finished. If something like that would happen to me, I would definitely do the same thing, and that's why the crow appeals to much to me and it always will.
