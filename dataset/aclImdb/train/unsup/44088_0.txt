It's a shame that A&E chose the Memorial Day weekend to cart out this trash. Memorial Day is a time to honor our fallen heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Instead, A&E decided to air this poor remake of a really good movie. In this version the military is portrayed as nothing more than incompetent, murderous buffoons who are constantly outwitted by a drug-addled journalist. So the message is this -- military BAD, media GOOD. The men and women who wear the uniform and are serving so admirably deserve better than this. I won't go into any more points that make this movie so bad. Just read the other viewers comments...the list is long.
