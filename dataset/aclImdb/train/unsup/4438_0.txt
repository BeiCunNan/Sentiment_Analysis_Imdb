Postman Pat and his black and white cat, Jess - legends in their own right. I was entertained endlessly by pat and his adventures when I was a young lad. The stories are simple and very easy to understand and teach us all valuable lessons on the road to life about being helpful and kind to your neighbours. With a theme song that rocks and other songs and music that were great to hum along to, Pat was truly a hero for our times. He's changed recently; in my opinion the changes are not that great. They've tried to make Pat even more PC, his lips move (sacrilege!) and there's no more moments of Pat just driving like there were in the 80s...just driving through the countryside. If anything the Postman Pat of today comments on the fast-pace of our children's society. But despite all that, no once can argue that Pat was, is and shall always be the greatest British hero.<br /><br />8/10
