People looking for raunch should look elsewhere. This is a study of a very bright, yet disturbed, young woman, who has something to say, and is willing to do something very extreme in order to make sure she's heard. I suspect many feminists will hate this film, and I suspect it will do Ms. Chong's heart good to rock the feminist theory boat. The way she chooses to claim and embrace her sexuality is repulsive, and yet fascinating and pwoerful. I really found myself thinking that I didn't care much for Ms. Chong, but that I deeply respected her motives. Highly reccomended for anyone interested in what the sex industry means, and can mean, for women.
