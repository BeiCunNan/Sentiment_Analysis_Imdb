I have seen She's So Lovely all the way through, and several times at that. As "thesnowleopard" clearly states he/she did not watch the entire film and therefore has no right to comment.<br /><br />She's So Lovely has a true independent spirit, great acting and an original story. All of which should be appreciated by any student of film. Sean Penn gives an awesome performance as an incredibly unique character who is at once sweet and frightening made humorous by the same characteristics which are within us all. And the fury offered by John Travolta causes the audience to roll with contagious laughter. I dare not say that everyone will love this film because they certainly will not. What I am saying is that it has many admirable elements which should not be so easily dismissed. Give it a chance and see for yourself. If you do like this film, you may also enjoy Hurlyburly.
