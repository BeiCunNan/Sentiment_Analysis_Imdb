Comedy Inc is one of the worst shows ever. I know people just go around saying that about any show that they don't like or that is bad, "this is the worst show ever", but in this case I really truly mean it. When I am watching it, I don't know why I punished myself like that but I did, I must be a masochist, but anyway whenever I watched it I literally believed I was watching the single worst TV comedy ever produced. It really is that bad and anyone reading this who has seen the show knows exactly what I am talking about, and anyone reading this who has never seen the show do yourself a favour and never ever try to watch this show it will just waste half an hour of your life and make you hate everything about life. If it wasn't for almost every other show on the Comedy Network then this show would be the worst all time, but since they have made even worse shows than this it is saved from the title of "all time worst".
