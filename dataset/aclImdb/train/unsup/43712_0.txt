I've just watched the movie this afternoon. I felt pretty much cheated into the movie, it is a alright movie. Maybe people who are trying to understand how tough life could be in singapore might find it great to watch it. However, personally i felt that the movie was overly predictable, right from the start you kinda know what ending it will give you and by having Richard winning the TOTO it's such a easy give away, not impactful enough for me at least. <br /><br />Things just fall into place too easily so that cause the conflict to be seen only in the surface, not deep enough to make it believable. However, i thought the character "Mei" was quite well played, i feel for the character, the struggles that she is facing and the pain she felt.
