This is one of those glamorous Hollywood movies made during the Great Depression, whose two main characters are a rich and gorgeous young couple with not a care in the world, other than the possibility that, upon returning from separate trips, circumstances indicate that they each may have been unfaithful. Consequently, in a mutual fit of self-righteous indignation, they decided on a whim to divorce (normally not a funny plot development, but bear in mind this is one of the best screwball comedies from the 1930s). And divorce they do, but before their divorce is finalized, they have to wait-out a 90-day grace period, and therein lies the magic of the story. For during these 90 days they each begin new, unlikely romances, and at the same time try their best to sabotage the other's new relationship. These attempts are brilliant comedy and they lead to a surprisingly thoughtful ending for such a zany movie.<br /><br />This movie is possibly my favorite comedy ever. It may be 70 years old, but the humor is not at all out-dated and the performances by the two leads, Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, are superb. Irene Dunne, especially, is in a league of her own in this film, outwitting even Cary Grant and proving exactly why she was considered one of the best comediennes of this era.<br /><br />The Awful Truth is less-known than some of its contemporary screwball comedies, like Bringing Up Baby and The Philadelphia Story, but I believe that this movie outshines them all.
