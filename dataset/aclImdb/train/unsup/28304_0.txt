I rented this movie based on the glowing review on this site. Was the review written by the director's himself? Or perhaps his mother. I can't imagine anyone else giving such a favourable review to this film.<br /><br />This is not only one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen, it's also one of the worst movies of any kind that I've ever seen (and I've seen some pretty bad films).<br /><br />Unfortunately it looks like the success of The Blair Witch Project has encouraged other amateur filmmakers to make low-budget horror movies, and they aren't letting an idiotic script and talentless actors prevent them from forging ahead.<br /><br />Watching this movie was such a complete waste of time that the local video store allowed me to rent another film for free by way of an apology.
