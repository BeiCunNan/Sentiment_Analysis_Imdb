While the original film had the action/Hollywood feel to it, it didn't seem much like D&D in the slightest. This one improves on that greatly. I was interested in the plot, even though it did tend to drag on at times, mostly the beginning. I liked how the characters actually matched D&D classes, and each one performed their duties as such. There was something missing, though I'm not quite sure what it was, and there were also some things that didn't quite mesh. Overall it matches D&D very well though, and a fan would have to be very picky for it to matter. I thought the cast acted well, as nobody was over the top or tried to call attention to themselves as super-hero extraordinaire (unlike the first movie). I was also disappointed to find out the lack of other work Chidzley has been involved in, but that's not movie related... oh well.
