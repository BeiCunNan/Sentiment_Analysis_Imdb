What you should be watching out for is the horrendously established script, terrible death scenes, and the ever so questionable acting. I absolutely loathed this movie. For the first 30, 40 minutes or so, it was quite tolerable, and I was actually very entertained. Then it just took a turn for the worse. The death scenes were so cheesy and poorly done, and the acting just went flat out ridiculous. Oh, and it's named Frogs for a reason, they show them about every 5 seconds, and for what, to prove that they actually have a point to the story. Maybe if they would've named the movie different, I would've been expecting different, but this is just filth, and you can tell just by looking at it. Don't waste your time, it's not even laughable. Oh, and here's a giggle, this is supposed to be comparable to The Birds.Ha ha ha!!!!!!
