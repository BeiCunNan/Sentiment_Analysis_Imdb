I haven't seen this film since 1982 but I still remember it fondly. Considering it is now 20+ years old, it contained technology that is deployed by the military today (light flashes and how it affects the human brain). The laser technology to fit clothing is also just starting to be used. It's a great film, with pretty good acting.<br /><br />Susan Dey (from "The Partridge Family" and "L.A. Law") and the late James Colburn (from "Our Man Flint" and "In Like Flint" fame) star in this film along with Albert Finney. The story is about a high-tech firm that measures models and then gives the plastic surgeon the right specs to make the model "perfect", a 'LOOKER'. The plastic surgeon, played by Albert Finney, finds out what is really going on and he is hunted to be exterminated. To say more would ruin the movie for you.<br /><br />The cinematography is not very good but I would still like to have this movie in my DVD collection.
