The worst thing about this film is that the main children are complete cheats, liars and thieves!!! It starts with them being fraudulent with a stone in a mobile phone box that they then shrink-wrap and sell for $27 - supposedly for dog food - burgers!. They steal a lot of stuff from their foster parents, and even lie to their friends!!!! They pile lie upon lie when they could easily have told the truth about their parents. I had to try to explain to my children that their behaviour was wrong and naughty - no excuses!!! None of it is really plausible - the abandoned hotel with all the stuff in it etc. Can't believe I paid good money and wasted time on this!!!<br /><br />I truly cannot believe so many people condone this type of behaviour - it shows what a sorry state our morals really are in.
