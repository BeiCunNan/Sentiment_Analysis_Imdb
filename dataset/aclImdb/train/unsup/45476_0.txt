Follows the exploits of man-boys who think impersonation in boring and irrelevant conferences, penis, and potty humor is political activism. Their bugaboo is the WTO, which they appear not to understand in the slightest and to which they ascribe a global conspiracy. The "Yes men" are kin to the creationists and global warming skeptics. All are ignorant amateurs who reject the scientific consensus (in this case, of professional economists regardless of political leanings) because it conflicts with their ideologically created world view. There is nothing approaching a serious treatment of "globalization" in this movie. This movie is even more anti-intellectual than a Micheal Moore movie.
