Andie(Kate Hudson) is a beautiful young woman that works for a women's magazine called Composure and for her next article, Andie has to write about how to lose a guy in 10 days. Ben(Matthew McConaughey)is an advertising executive and he makes a bet with his friends that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days. Of course, these two meet each other and the scam is on. Andie will do anything to lose a guy and Ben will do anything to win a girl, what they don't expect is that the two of them will fall in love with each other. I thought this was a funny and charming romantic comedy. The lovely Kate Hudson gives a great performance, she was absolutely hilarious! I would give How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days 7/10.
