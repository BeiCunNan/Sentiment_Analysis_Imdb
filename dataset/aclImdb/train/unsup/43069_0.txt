Robert Mitchum as Dan Milner does well here, as he most always does, despite a confused script that starts out as a gangster drama and, about 80% into the movie, with Cardigan's (Vincent Price) rescue effort, tries to become a comedy, with little success. In addition, there are a few too many absurdities in the plot (e.g, why would Milner, having escaped being dragged aboard Ferraro's yacht, then go back there on his own to put himself in a situation where he is outnumbered 15 to 1?). The villainy of Raymond Burr's Nick Ferraro borders on the cartoonish. And the purpose of the presence of Jim Backus's clownish Myron Winton is unclear.<br /><br />The redeeming feature is Jane Russell. This is the first movie in which I have seen her, and the salivating adoration of thousands of American GI's in WWII is completely understandable. Just imagine if she could act!!
