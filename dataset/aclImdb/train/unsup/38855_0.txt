but that's it. An R-rated animated film has Fritz (a cat) being told off endlessly by his wife about his drug habit, being on welfare, being bad in bed etc etc. As she screams at him, he sits there totally stoned out of his mind and drifts off into different lives. The emphasis here is on sex, vulgarity, tons of swearing, explicit violence, buckets of blood and plenty on racial issues (in one segment, New Jersey is sold to black people!). In other segments: Friz meets an alcoholic, flatuant Jesus Christ; is an assistant to Hitler and psychoanalyzes him; is an astronaut; in a pointless 30s segments and trying to cash his welfare check.<br /><br />How this got an R rating is beyond me--there's enough explicit material here for a strong NC-17. The film never stops moving, the animation is very good but there's no real story. The sequences are very strange (to say the least) and take pot shots at everything from religion to race to sex and drugs--but why? There's no point or point of view. Also there are pointless psychedlic light shows with bad 70s music. They bored me silly--I fast forwarded through them. Also the constant swearing, violence and sex wore me down and got dull after a while. And the racial issues are handled quite offensively (for black and white) and are VERY 70s.<br /><br />Not really worth your time. Skip it. "Fritz the Cat" was better.
