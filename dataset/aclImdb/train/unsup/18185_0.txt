Brad Dourif gives an excellent performance (as always), and the plot has an intriguing symbolic feel to it.I had the impression the artist could represent the "shadow" archetype of Father Tyrone, and the of Christian symbolism is interesting. It could have been a really good movie, but it's dragged down by the rest of the cast - particularly the overacted, one dimensional "mad artist", the seedy atmosphere and the corny score. Oh yes, and I don't understand why people are praising the paintings. They were, as the art dealer said, "self indulgent overrated crap". Still, the film is worth watching, if for nothing else than for Dourif's performance alone,
