This movie is a must see for any teenage girl. It has more heart and soul then a lot of movies that I have seen in a long time. Trudi is a bad girl but when it comes down to it, she will do what is right for her. Shade is one who you can't understand at first but once you get to know her you can relate. This movie is worth a 10 because it can show that sometimes no matter what you have to do what is right for you and not the rest of the world.It also shows that if you get caught crying sometimes that it is not always a sign of weakness, sometimes it is a sign that you have just had enough! Any girl from the age of 13+ should get their best friends and mothers for a girls movie. It just might make all of the fighting stop!Even if only for a moment!
