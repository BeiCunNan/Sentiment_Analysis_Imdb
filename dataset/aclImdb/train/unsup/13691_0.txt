This movie is almost perfect, if there is such a thing. Meryl Streep gives her finest performance ever as Sophie. In fact, her performance here is quite possibly the best movie acting that I have ever seen. (It's really that good.) Plus there's even more--the music, the directing, the writing, the supporting actors--are all excellent. Be warned that this movie is very moving and tragic, but it is extremely well done. It will make you cry and laugh--it will fill you with hope and despair--it will make you appreciate life and understand sorrow.
