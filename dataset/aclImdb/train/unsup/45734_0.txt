Oh my god-what a terrible movie! I always try to see the good things in movies and I never give a harsh criticism like other ppl-up until now. This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was bad on so many levels that I don't know where to begin,so forgive me if my comment is a bit messy...<br /><br />The plot was terribly weak and completely unoriginal-a madman(Hooper)bombing places(deja vu of "speed",but "speed" is 100 times better), 2 cops(one with a personal agenda-his partner was killed)trying to stop him.<br /><br />The dialogue was awful,full of cliches and sometimes so stupid I couldn't bare it so I put the tv on mute. Like in the end with Seagal's "smart" words-"love is forever and forever is eternity"-or some sh*t like that,really can't remember cause couldn't decide whether to laugh or cry.<br /><br />The acting was plain horrible. I saw school plays which were better acted. Took me half an hour into the movie to realize Hooper's character is Irish,cause his accent was on and off. And Seagal looked like he was bored with the whole thing,and just wanted to be paid so he could go home.<br /><br />The special effects weren't special at all. A few standard explosions which I could live with,but that scene where Hooper and Pressly are driving in the car...was there anyone who didn't notice the use of a blue screen?It couldn't get more obvious than that...<br /><br />So,okay-the plot,dialogue,acting,special effects-they all stink,so what about some typical Steven Seagal fighting scenes to save the day? After all,that's why we usually watch his movies,right? Well,not this time! Can you believe there were none?! Only one stupid scene where we only see Seagal's face and then a shot from the back when his double(probably)is fighting(if you can call it that)for him.Meaning,we never actually see Seagal fighting.<br /><br />To sum up,this is truly an awful movie,and it was better if the money spent on making it had been donated for charity. A waste of money. Avoid.
