In another short film by "Educational Films", Director Charles Lamont has re-united Sonny (Junior Coughlan) and Mary Lou (Shirley Temple)in this early Temple vehicle. In this one, Little Mary Lou is watching her big brother Sonny do a chemistry experiment. Sonny's pal shows up and they make plans to look for gold in the desert, to raise money for Sonny, so he can attend the military school his friend will be attending in the fall. Mary Lou hides in the trunk of Sonny's car, much to the consternation of Sonny when he finds her. While he and his pal look for gold, Mary Lou befriends a man she calls "GUS", who seems lost and can't recall his identity. When the boys tell him they're searching for gold, "Gus" shows them bags of "gold dust". Back at home, the boys show their find to a local assayer while "Gus" fiddles with Sonny's chemistry set. The resulting explosion helps "Gus" regain his memory and he rewards Sonny. Director Lamont is better known for other films, including Abbott and Costello features, Ma and Pa Kettle films and "Hit the Ice" and "Where She Danced"
