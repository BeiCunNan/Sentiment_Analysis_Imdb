This disillusioning tale of time travel is more popularly known as Time Chasers. It is a tale of good vs evil, plaid vs pink and chin vs CEO. You'll laugh, you'll cry...but mostly you'll just cry.<br /><br />As a standalone, without MST, this film is still one of the funniest things American cinema has left in a steaming pile on the sidewalk. The only moments that don't induce side-splitting laughter are the moments when our be-chinned hero makes an attempt at a joke. Then you just rub your temples and moan.<br /><br />As for the cast, it's well-rounded on both sides. Our good guys consist of butt-chinned Nick Miller, the scientist cum action star who delights us with his hockey hair, frightens us with his strange face and tempts us with his partial nudity. The heroine, Lisa Henson, is apparently played by a robot. She displays no tinge of emotion so I can only assume the automaton in her role was not yet advanced enough to out-act the Commodore 64 in Nick's plane. Our comic relief is the broken down cousin of Bruce Springsteen. He's constantly asleep or spilling coffee, sometimes multitasking by doing both at the same time. Jim Carrey eat your heart out.<br /><br />As for the bad guys, this is where the fun lies. A short fat man in a pink jacket just screams pure evil. He's the unwitting sidekick of the true mastermind from hell. Yes, J.K. Robertson is the epitome of villainy. His strange accent makes him not only hard to understand, but hard to take seriously. The muscle of Evil Co. is the assistant janitor who pounds the hell out of our hero before his girlfriend saves him with a gutter down pipe.<br /><br />As for the plot, it's almost as befuddling as the mere spectacle of Nick's chin. Nick invents a time traveling plane and puts his science busting work onto 8 floppy disks. He proceeds to hand over his life's work to the CEO of a fortune 500 company for an undisclosed amount of money. According to Robertson, breaking the time barrier is worth "millions". Bill Gates made more by stealing the graphic user interface from Xerox. Wow, I think Nick got low-balled.<br /><br />Back on track, Nick heads to the future, a bleak future where kids wear lime green tights and talk on an amazing invention known as the mobile cellular phone. Crazy. J.K. soon heads to the future with HIS new plane, where he somehow manages to single handedly cause the apocalypse. And you thought Y2K was bad. In a series of events, Nick and J.K fly back and forth through time trying to do something. Exactly what they are trying to do is beyond our imagination and beyond the budget of this film, so we never really find out.<br /><br />In the end, the most horrible thing possible happens and we end up with 2 Nicks. God help us all.<br /><br />Aside from a cameo by Noah Emmerich driving a cab and speaking like a mongoloid, the acting is either non-existent (Lisa) or overdone to the point of inducing nausea (Nick). I can't consciously recommend this film to anyone without the MST crew commenting. It gave me the trots.<br /><br />Without MST this stinker gets a VERY generous 2/10, with MST it is my single favorite episode and pulls out a 9/10.
