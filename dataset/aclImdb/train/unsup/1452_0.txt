I rented Just Write for Valentine's Day, largely due to the reviews I read on this site (my adoration of Sherilyn Fenn had a little impact, also...). Most people thought it was a great date movie.<br /><br />You know the basis of the story if you've read the summary, so I won't repeat it here. Jeremy Piven, from TV's short-lived Cupid, plays the bus driver whose favorite actress is Amanda Clark (wonderfully played by Fenn). He brings the same appeal he did to Cupid - - funny and down-to-earth. He really makes you pull for his character.<br /><br />Sherilyn Fenn has one of the best roles of her career, even though it may not be much of a stretch (an actress playing an actress). She looks absolutely wonderful and, while I don't know what Sherilyn's like personally, gives Amanda such warmth and sincerity that it's hard NOT to fall in love with someone like her.<br /><br />The two of them have a really nice chemistry together. I wanted to see more of them as a couple. There were some nice supporting characters who added a lot to the story. There was the typical misunderstanding, but it was resolved in a nice way. Some reviews have stated that it was unrealistic for a famous movie star to fall for a guy like this, but I don't view that as a negative. First, all good romantic comedies have similar problems (Pretty Woman, Notting Hill, Sleepless in Seattle - - how realistic are they!?); they all resolve them in an interesting way, just like this movie does. Second, I enjoy putting myself in a movie ("How would I react in this situation?"), and this one allowed me to pretend that I was pursuing Amanda/Sherilyn - - that's what movies are for!<br /><br />In summary, (guys) don't view this as a chick flick just because it involves a love story. It's every bit as good as those I mentioned above. Rent this movie with someone you love and enjoy the ride. I actually watched it again the next day, and even fast-forwarded through it a third time to watch just the scenes between Piven and Fenn. It's special. My score: 10
