Stuff like this makes you want to ralph big time. It's unbelievable how people invest money and time in a project like this. The acting is abominable, it's a disgrace how actors like KÃ¼rt Rogiers even make a living, and trust me, they are well off! By making crap like this they sustain the low level of B-movies being produced in Belgium and The Netherlands and then they wonder how come Belgian films aren't that successful or aren't being appreciated... The director is an utter moron, the plot stinks; it's not even funny to a five-year-old. For those of you who read a review that this film is enjoyable for those who enjoyed Taxi(which is the only reason I watched this piece of crap), forget it. It is nothing like Taxi, movies like this should never see daylight, I'm ashamed to be Belgian when I see this horrible piece of filth. A complete and utter waste of time. Unbelievable how this gets funded, how this gets a 6,5 average on IMDb, if this were a non-paying service, everyone would be able to vote and it's score would be sub-zero.
