Rented it purely b/c it says "He wants you...DEAD." Unbelievably bad movie, with sub par acting, so called "special" effects that weren't so special, and a story that didn't make sense to my drunk roommates. If there is a bright side to this story, and I doubt there is, it is when the family receives their dead brother home in a casket, only to place him in the living room like furniture. Son/Brother/Husband, died in battle, flown home, and his family puts him in the living room in his casket. Absolutely priceless film making.<br /><br />Utter crap. Good for a laugh thats about it. Check out the fact that his son actually likes to hang out with his dead dad that has half his face blown off and tells him to go around killing people like his mom. Absolutely amazing really.
