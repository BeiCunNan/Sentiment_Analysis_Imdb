The movie was very bad, it poked fun at religion, several sexual oriented and suggestive scenes. I do not recommend for any child to watch this movie the parents will be left to explain a lot to the children and the child will be exposed to a lot of suggestive, ignorant content. I do not recommend a person waste their money on this. I was expecting this movie to be hysterical and fun to see, but instead I was disappointed and bored. I only laughed at a few parts and I left the movie disappointed. The vulgar language was annoying and I heard other people who went to see the movie discuss how disappointed they were as well. I do not recommend this movie, it was a disappointment and not funny at all just boring, stupid and offensive. Fairwarning, I am going to tell you a spoiler so don't read beyond this point...<br /><br />The movie is basically The Chronicles of Narnia just redone to incorporate other movies such as the x-men, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Carebbean, the Divinchi Code and more. This was not funny and a complete disappointment and focused on sex and made fun of religion.
