"Seven Brides" seems like it spent pennies on a script, on the acting, on the film equipment and the film crew and 99% of the film budget on the seven-minute dance scene where they raise the building. Although I truly must admit it is one of the most exciting dance numbers ever put on film. But to build a whole film around one dance number is pathetic, really. <br /><br />And it's only seven minutes! <br /><br />Before and after that scene, everything else is just flat. Flat, flat, flat. Flatter than most actresses before they make it to the silver screen. Flatter than Roseanne's singing voice doing the Star-Spangled Banner.<br /><br />Howard Keel is cool. He plays the same character in all his movies, which isn't so bad. Although I'm glad he knew to spend the better part of his career on the stage. Acting isn't his thing.<br /><br />One more positive thing: The movie does have lots of color. Vivid primary colors. Costumes in Technicolor. Ooooooh!<br /><br />4 stars for the dance scene. <br /><br />1 star for the rest of the movie.
