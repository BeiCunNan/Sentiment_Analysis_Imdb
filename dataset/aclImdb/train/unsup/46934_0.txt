I had forgotten movies could be this gut-wrenchingly awful. I love Mandy Moore, but one has to wonder if she even bothered to check out the script before she said yes to this drivel. <br /><br />The script is wretched, the editing is blotchy and confusing, and there is nary a character you can genuinely care about here. Everything about this movie is wrong, and in the end, the writing (and the entire feel) is so horrid that not even her screen presence could save it.<br /><br />Why do movies like this ever see the light of day? {Lets see ... Mandy Moore ... 2003 ... hot teen commodity ... lets do it!}<br /><br />Yeah, after sitting through 90 minutes of this, the joke's on me. I cant remember the last time something was this painful to watch. If you're alone in a remote cabin on a frigid night and have nothing else to do but watch this dreck, well -- go outside and take your chances with the bears.
