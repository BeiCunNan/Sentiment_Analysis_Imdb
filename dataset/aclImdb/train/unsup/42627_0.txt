Sometimes I get the impression when the produces/director/cast/crew for the "made-for-tv" movies cross the border into Canada (as they often do,), some sort or ray or odorless gas descends upon them -- causing movies to be less than they otherwise should be.<br /><br />Some of them (unfortunately, all too few) should be excellent, but are only "good;" those which should be good, turn-out only "fair;" and so on.<br /><br />This one could have been "O.K," or "fair." But it was pretty bad.<br /><br />The performances were fairly good, and the actors/characters somewhat engaging. But an average story went downhill as events progressed, and the ending was contrived, a bit silly, and about the most boring and unimaginative in the history of film-- in Canada or anywhere else.
