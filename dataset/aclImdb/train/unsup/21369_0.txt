Seriously this is in my top 10 worst movies of all time its position would probably be around 4. I think this movie is like pointing a gun at a child's face watching them scream moving the gun away from them then pointing the gun over and over again at their face disturbingly funny yet immorally wrong, why don't these actors think am i actually in a movie like this or why Michael Dudikoff is in any film for that matter. Overall this movie was a complete toss fest and should be watched by anyone who loves action movies that are never suppose to have been made..................................I needed an exorcism after this movie
