Casper Van Dien, last seen battling giant bugs in STARSHIP TROOPERS, now gets to take on sharks in the aptly named SHARK ATTACK. Once again it's the humans who are the *real* bad guys, and Van Dien soon finds himself in more trouble than he bargained for. The acting is pretty bad all around, although the mad scientist is amusing and has some good one-liners. The plot is fairly meaningless until the very end, when everything gets impossibly complicated. It's like a Bobbsey Twins mystery gone bad. Complementing the acting and plot portions of the film is second-rate documentary footage that the producers probably sneaked out of the Discovery Channel's "Shark Week" reject bin. If you like BAD movies, you should enjoy this one. If you don't enjoy B movies, try JAWS instead.
