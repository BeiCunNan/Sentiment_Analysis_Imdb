Please forgive me but I fell in love with this movie even if it's not exactly the kind of movie that is hip.... Three young boys have no clue how a naked woman looks like so they save money to go to town and ask a hooker (Melanie Griffith) to show them her delicious body. One thing leads to another and V the hooker ends up staying by one of the kids (Michael Patrick Carter) who tells his dad (Ed Harris) that she's a mathteacher. And then in pure Pretty Woman-style the kid wants the hooker as his mum and tries to unite dad and the whore...and does it work? You know the answer but just a pimp (Malcolm McDowell) wants his moneygoat back... Well well, you laugh and I guess you are right as this history could have end up in something terrible but there is a freshness Ã  la "Stand By Me" that makes "Milk Money" great and of course the performances from both Ed Harris and Melanie Griffith...just as usual Malcolm McDowell suffers from terrible overacting.
