I have no idea why more people don't review this movie. It's better than "The Great Dictator," "The Gold Rush," and "City Lights." I like this movie because it presents Chaplin in his prime: the 20's and 30's. There is no Stoogesque slapstick here, instead there's Keatonesque timing and choreography.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT. There's a running joke where Chaplin is being chased by a mule. This was just hilarious. I don't know why I mentioned that, but I guess it's because I wanted to be facetious and have a spoiler alert. Ha ha. END OF SPOILER ALERT. YOU MAY RETURN TO READING FACILITIES.<br /><br />A true comic masterpiece that displays Chaplin great talent. It also has a great, poignant ending. Chaplin was the first of his kind and the greatest comic of cinema.
