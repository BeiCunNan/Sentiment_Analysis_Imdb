This is a solid and interesting documentary which I would recommend to everybody who loves Metal but also to people who are not necessarily fans of the genre but have interest in music or underground culture.<br /><br />What makes this documentary likable and catches the attention is that it combines solid knowledge and research with a personal style. The author declares himself a fan, visits clubs and festival, travels to get interviews and adds his personal touch to the whole story which makes it likable and well documented at the same time.<br /><br />Sure, the fans of different genres and bands may always have complaints to enter because their favorite flavor of metal or their specific band did not get enough screen time or even omitted. I for example may have liked to hear more full acts of music and I am wondering why Gothic rock did not get some coverage. Yet, we find in the film both an historic thread that is well built, as well as a good coverage of specific subjects and messages like sex, death, violence, etc. that traverse the whole history and different styles in a consistent manner. This documentary if both informational and entertaining.
