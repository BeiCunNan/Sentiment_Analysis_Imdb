Moving (1988) was an fun film from Richard Pryor. Instead of making another cheesy P.G. rated family film, Mr. Pryor goes back to his adult tinged humor. In this starring vehicle, Pryor stars as a family man who learns that he has to move out of state if he wants to keep his position with the company. CAn the family make a smooth transition from one neighborhood to another? Will they have problems with the new neighbors or the strange movers? Find out when you watch MOVING!!<br /><br />As with all of these type of films, you;ll have the kid who doesn't want to leave and the worried family members about the new community they're moving into. Randy Quaid co-stars (in two roles). King Kong Bundy plays a mover, Stacey Dash makes an early co-starring role as Pryor;s teenage daughter, Dana Carvey guest stars as a weird dude who's hired to drive Mr. Pryor's beloved Saab and Rodney Dangerfield makes an uncredited appearance as well.<br /><br />I liked this movie for some reason. The humor was a little more towards old Richard Pryor. But it's not one of his best efforts. Mr. Pryor would make one more funny movie (Hear No Evil, See No Evil) before illness would force him into early retirement.<br /><br />Recommended.
