I originally watched this movie because I loved watching Skeet Ulrich in the TV series "Miracles" (another great & provocative series cancelled by the U.S. networks, way before it's time), and wanted to see some more of his work.<br /><br />I just found out on this site that Skeet made this movie BEFORE "Miracles." I'm glad to find out that this movie didn't entirely ruin his career.<br /><br />This must have been one of those sad movies made on a minuscule budget, to satisfy one of the Canadian cable network's "Canadian content" requirements. It is reminiscent of some of the terrible Canadian films made in the 1970's and 80's.<br /><br />The writing appears to be that of a 12 or 13 year-old, and even the talents of Skeet and Leslie Nielsen can't save this one. The dialogue is so bad, I found myself actually feeling embarrassed for the actors who had to spew out the words. Leslie must have been short of cash that month to agree to be in this one. The lame gags, might work for 12 year olds, but no one above that age should even waste the money on renting this piece of "sled-dog crap."
