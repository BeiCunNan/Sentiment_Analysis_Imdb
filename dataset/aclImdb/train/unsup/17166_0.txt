This Movie is disappointing just bad and I mean everything bad.bad plot,Terrible acting,Flat out characters,bad editing everything is bad.<br /><br />The movie is about Flea(Cam'ron)A everyday person going nowhere in life until he chooses the life of drug dealing to get money and that all I got to say.<br /><br />Now for the bad parts let me start off with the acting I'll tell You one thing these people do not know how to act everyone is either going over-the-top or just giving a Dead-Pan Performance.the worst acting comes from Cam'ron.For example the scene where his cousin dies he can't even cry or show real emotion.just fake and bad.the only good acting comes from Funkmaster Flex who disses cam'ron in one scene which was the only funny scene that had me laughing and he ain't even an actor.Juelz Santana who plays Bandana is Bad as well who gives a over-the top performance even though his character is so underdeveloped.<br /><br />Speaking of development there is not one developed character.everyone is flat and Dead-Pan.You don't know nothing from any of the characters so the development is bad.<br /><br />As for the Plot It's too confusing and lame.The plot just switches from one part to another making you lost.Plus the pacing is long with all these parts about selling drugs and getting money.<br /><br />Overall Bad movie to stay away from.Really.
