I saw SECOND BEST last year at the Sundance Film Festival. Eric Weber has brought us a heart-felt and touching film about the lovable loser Elliot (played by the always entertaining Joe Pantoliano). Beyond being bitter sweet, this film is also very funny. It is not very often that a movie combines being so tragic and hilarious as well as Eric has in this film.<br /><br />As a woman, I also found this movie enlightening. It is rare look into what men are really thinking from envy of wealthy friends to attraction to women they cannot have. This movie is required viewing for every woman out there, believe me, it makes you think! See this movie. You will be glad you did.
