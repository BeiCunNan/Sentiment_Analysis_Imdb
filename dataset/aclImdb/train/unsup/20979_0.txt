Refreshing? How can you call a movie with such graphic brutality and violence refreshing? Because it is a true story account of forgiveness. How can someone endure such pain, such torture, such inhumane treatment and in the end offer their brutalizers forgiveness. In our day and age of "dog eat dog" living, we need stories such as these to remind us that there is a better way, no matter what you have to endure.<br /><br />The movie is brilliantly written and brilliantly acted. You will want your friends and family to see this film! It is extremely unfortunate that the makers of this film could not get the financial backing for it to appear in theaters, it would have surely been a hit. I look at some of the movies that are out there today and they are so disappointing. Please send a message to Hollywood and endorse this work of art that should have made it into every theater in this great land.
