This film is a 75 minute animated commercial for the Gobots toy line. The animation was produced by Hanna-Barbera, so I thought I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />Since I was nearly 30 years old when this toy line was introduced, I didn't expect to really understand the charactors, and the plotline.<br /><br />As I watched this epic, I kept wondering what made Roddy McDowell do a voice for this thing. Musta been paid major bucks.<br /><br />The bad guys are destroying everything in their paths, and the good guys (the GOBOTSÂ®) are out to get them. Lots of pointless shooting, and noise. Perfect for the kids of the mid '80's.<br /><br />The color and animation is typical Hanna-Barbera. The backgrounds were decent, but the stilted animation style hurt the flow of the story. Perhaps Tonka (the toy maker) just couldn't see paying more for better work. If they had, this film would be better.<br /><br />Hanna-Barbera is not at fault here. They are capable of some fine work, and have done fine work in the past. This, unfortunately, is not the one.<br /><br />This film was rated G. If there had been live actors instead of animation, this thing would be rated PG. What's the difference?
