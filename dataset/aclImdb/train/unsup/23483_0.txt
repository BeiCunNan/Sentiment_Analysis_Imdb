Being a gay man and a horror movie fan I was really looking forward to seeing this...but it's really not that good.<br /><br />Film begins with two men making out in a car--until they are attacked and beheaded by a guy in a Satan suit. The next day is Halloween and four gay friends are attending the party in West Hollywood. They all fit the typical slasher film stereotypes: the nice guy (Dylan Fergus); the innocent, nervous guy (Hank Harris); the party animal (Andrew Levitas) and the one who wants to be loved for his mind NOT his body (Matt Phillps as a drag queen). While getting there they make fun of the guy in the Devil costume. During the night he stalks them...and kills them one by one. Who is he and why is he doing this? Don't bother asking--the film doesn't tell you! <br /><br />The film is beautifully shot (some VERY nice images here) and the murder scenes are very gory and well-done. Also the actors were hired for their looks and bodies--but they're really pretty good! Fergus is handsome and likable; Harris is a little TOO nerdy; Levitas is drop dead gorgeous with a GREAT body...but overdoes it a little; Phillips is excellent as the drag queen--he looks stunning as a woman AND a guy. Also they are joined by Bryan Kirkwood who's pretty bad. He's obviously straight and seems uncomfortable. But there's two BIG problems with the film--the script and dialogue.<br /><br />The script is chockful of stupid moments--someone is killed on a crowded dance floor...and nobody notices; the killer magically appears everywhere his victims are; we never find out who he is or why he's doing this. One one hand I thought thought this might be a tribute to the stupid 80s slasher films which were ALSO full of stupid incidents. On the other hand I thought---is that something we should pay tribute to? And the dialogue is just dreadful--no gay man (or straight man) talks like these guys.<br /><br />But, all in all, it was fun seeing a slasher film with gay men and showing off some nice partial nudity (no frontal but the guys are shirtless 90% of the time and there is a group butt shot). I'm giving this an 8 because the guys were just incredible and gave good performances...but I can't say I loved this.<br /><br />Recommended for gay men and horror movie fans who have no problem with gay guys. There's also plenty of room for a sequel. Let's hope there is one--with a better plot and dialogue.
