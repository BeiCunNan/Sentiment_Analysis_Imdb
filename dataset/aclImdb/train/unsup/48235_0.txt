We all realise that Mr Lundgren and lousy movies are synonymous, and this certainly lives down to that reputation! The "action" scenes are mostly laughable, Dolph is tossed from a gantry and lands some 15 feet below only to recover later. Similarly he is hit with a full fire extinguisher once on the head and twice on the back which downs him only to spring to life shortly after. The gun fights are pitiful, low rent John Woo double pistol action with opponents facing off at 10 feet, blazing away and not hitting anything... The interior sets for both the sub and aircraft carrier are like left over Star Trek units, a few blank walls with banks of flashing lights and video screens. Silent Trigger at least has a big gun to look at, this is a waste of time.
