An unsentimental look at the consequences of the AIDS outbreak on a bunch of friends and lovers in 1980s Paris.<br /><br />It was unusual to see folk come down with the disease while it was still classified as a 'mystery' and while docs were desperately searching for cures, reasons, symptoms etc.<br /><br />Some of the news reportage shown resembled news clips from a zombie movie.<br /><br />There were lots of good bits to the film, some interesting characters and lives, it was well acted and the story swept along without resorting to melodrama.<br /><br />A pity the unfulfilling ending came on too sudden.
