Back to the beginning! It is cool to see the agents go back to where everything began in Requiem.<br /><br />An inconsistency pops up in the teaser. We see Miles' watch spinning backwards?!?What's up with that? In previous episodes, when UFOs are involved, watches stop, not spin backwards, indicating a loss of time. Are they implying that time went backwards? I don't think so. I suppose it's a writing oversight.<br /><br />Poor Krycek. He winds up in the craziest places. Missile silos in South Dakota, prisons in Tunisia. Marita would've preferred to leave him there. I guess the spark is gone, even though they shared the steamiest kiss in the entire series.<br /><br />It was cool to see the audit. I'm quite surprised it hasn't happened earlier. I like Scully's smile when Mulder mentions assaulting the auditor. I think because she wishes she would have done it herself. The one problem I have with the audit though is that the auditor questions what Mulder and Scully are still investigating if they have solved everything. Why would a financial guy care about things like that? You'd think he'd just worry about the money aspect of things. Perhaps, it's just a way of combining a couple of characters in one; an auditor to run over their expenses and someone to question the authenticity of their work.<br /><br />Another inconsistency is when it shows the Cigarette Smoking Man(CSM) dying. Jeremiah Smith healed him of his lung cancer. I understand that the brain surgery he had is killing him but that shouldn't affect his throat, and having to smoke through it as if he still had lung cancer.<br /><br />The first deleted scene for this episode gives out a lot more information. It's too bad they cut it.<br /><br />I like how Chris Carter leaves clues throughout the episode of Scully being pregnant. She's holding the baby with a look in her eyes. She's sick throughout the episode. It still comes as a big shock if you don't catch the clues.<br /><br />Requiem is full of nostalgia. The Lone Gunmen return, albeit for a pretty useless cameo. It's cool to see the return of the Alien Bounty Hunter. A question I have is when he impersonates the personalities of the people, like Det. Miles. Then other times he doesn't, like Ray, Theresa's husband. I find it inconsistent how he acts when impersonating other people.<br /><br />The wiggling effect is cool when Gary and Scully encounter the UFO. It looks like they borrowed that effect from 'Rush' earlier in the season. However, I don't think that could have been good for Scully's baby.<br /><br />I found it interesting how Marita Covarrubias refers to CSM as Cancer Man to Mulder, as if it's common knowledge that is what he should be called.<br /><br />I like the music towards the end. Good job, Mark Snow.<br /><br />I don't like using pregnancy as a plot device. But, on the other hand, Scully's been longing for children most of the series. So it does fit the yearnings of her character. It's just sad to see the show start in the "baby" direction.<br /><br />The inconsistencies in the episode are a bit annoying. I mean, come on, Chris Carter wrote this stuff to begin with, and he ignores it in this episode for cool shots. That's the only reason those things I mentioned are like that, for cool scenes. Chris Carter should have stuck with the original ideas. For that, Requiem doesn't receive full marks.<br /><br />Chris Carter wrote Requiem not knowing whether or not the series would end after this episode. Like, I said before, this episode is full of nostalgia and most of the main recurring characters are brought in for a (seemingly) last hurrah. This would have made a nice end to the series, leaving the fate of Mulder in doubt, in true X-Files fashion.
