I think I started to watch the show when I was 11 or 12 years old (I am now 15). I thought it was great back then. A friend and I talked about it all the time. If I hadn't seen it the day before, she would tell me every detail about it, and vice versa. <br /><br />At that time I would have given it 10 - no questions asked. Now I'm more like 7. For to reasons. It became to unreal. (I mean, how many has 4-6 friends who have all been drug-addicts, and who have all been dating each other?)I also think that the actors, the screenplays and the plot in each episode became worse and worse, the longer we got towards the ending of the show. <br /><br />Still it brings up happy memories when I see an episode once in a while. So happy 7 from me:)
