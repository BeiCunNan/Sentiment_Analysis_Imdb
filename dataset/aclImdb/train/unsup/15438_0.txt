I'm glad someone did this before it was too late. In some ways it really *was* too late, as some of the old-timers were already gone by the time this was filmed. This is an objective, even sympathetic, document of pre-abduction contactees.<br /><br />The Aetherians, including George King (aka "Aetherius") are here. There's some great B&W footage of King channeling the Space Brothers, and some more recent footage of his followers in Hollywood charging the psychic battery. Watch for King in his regalia, talking about Jesus. It doesn't get any better!<br /><br />Howard and Connie Metzger are here, talking about the good old days of contacteeism (including Giant Rock), plunking on the piano, telling jokes, ridiculing more recent abductees. He shows us the model in his garage, too. She really loves him. You tell 'em, Howard!<br /><br />The Giant Rock footage includes film of the great George Adamski himself. He died long before this film was made. I'm glad some old footage of him made it into the film.<br /><br />Dan Fry is here. He doesn't say much... just sits on the nursing home porch, rocking and laughing to himself at something unseen. At the joke he pulled on all of us, perhaps?<br /><br />There are others: Rev. Frank Stranges, the Unarians, the Blue Rose Ministries, and others who I've forgotten for the moment. All are worth the price of admission.<br /><br />If you have *any* interest in what the early UFO movement was like, pick up a copy of this one-of-a-kind film. You'll be glad you did.
