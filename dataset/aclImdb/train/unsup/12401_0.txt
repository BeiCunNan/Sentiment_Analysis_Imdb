I saw this movie at 1:30 AM one night, and couldn't turn it off. I'm a bit of an obscure movie buff, and I turned this on just as it started - so I didn't know the premise. Well, within a few minutes, I was dying to see how it turned out. Because I had NO clue what was going on, I really thought this was a documentary about the now-known fake Nick Decker. I really felt bad for this guy, because he was a putrid, horrible actor. However, the actor playing Nick was convincing me that this guy was a really bad actor, while when he was not in auditions was what I consider a GREAT performance. He really made me think this guy was real, his struggles were genuine, and his angers real. He seemed like a young, naive, honest guy from the midwest trying to make it in a killer type of acting atmosphere. The best scene in the movie is when Angie finds out he's been lying to her.<br /><br />What had captured my attention was when I heard the name Adam Rifkin...who I had heard of, but wasn't quite familiar with. Well, I think he did a terrific job with this movie! Sometimes the "normal" way of doing things gets old, and this was very refreshing. It also goes to show how hard it is to get work in Hollywood.<br /><br />What the big surprise of this movie was lies with that of the red-headed vixen Angie Everheart. I REALLY THOUGHT THIS HAD happened, with the fake press clips, newspapers clips, etc. She was fantastic!!! Look at her career before this movie, and you will see like 6 jobs in 5 years in movies. Since this movie, she's had like 15 jobs in 3 years! Angie has really matured as an actress...I also like how the "angie" character was sincere and genuine, it really made me like the personality of her and want to know more about her....overall, very entertaining..surprisingly good performances when you find out afterwards it's fake (but based on someone else's story)
