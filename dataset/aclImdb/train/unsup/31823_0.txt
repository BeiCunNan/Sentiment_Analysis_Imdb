Pardes is a beautiful film. Shahrukh Khan is stunning as usual. Newcomer Mahima Choudhary was fantastic. Usually female newcomers overact like Aish is Aur Pyar Ho Gaya but then she proved in HDDCS that she can act. Apoorva Agnihotri was very good as a villain.<br /><br />Kishorilal (Amrish Puri) is coming back from America to India to see his friend, Suraj Dev (Alok Nath). Suraj Dev has a daughter called Ganga (Mahima Chouhary). He likes her and he wants an Indian girl for his "westernised" son, Rajiv (Apoorva Agnihotri). Kishorilal has another son who is adopted and who is not so westernised, Arjun (Shahrukh Khan). Rajiv and Arjun go to India. Arjun and Ganga are immediately friends. Ganga and Rajiv get on well too. Rajiv says that he likes her and wishes for her to go to America with them and see what life will be like after marriage. Ganga goes with her aunt (Himani Shivpuri). When Ganga reaches there she gets a few surprises..........<br /><br />This is a must see film. I like the way Ganga only felt comfortable with Arjun and not her fiancee. Ganga could feel that she can only to talk to Arjun. Whenever he was not around she would get bored and lonely. The song "I love India" is fantastic. The film deserves a 9/10.
