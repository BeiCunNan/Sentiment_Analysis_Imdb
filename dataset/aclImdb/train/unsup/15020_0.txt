This movie managed to do what most movies can't, no matter how bad they are - this one was so unbearable that I couldn't finish it. An absolutely awful "slasher" that is lacking everything a slasher movie should have; gore, sex, nudity, suspense, scares (give or take that last one). This one didn't even try to deliver any of that. Once I heard one of the female actors yell out "I'll cut you like a Thanksgiving turkey!", I knew it was over. Damn! At least say something original or witty! I hate these slasher movies with the supposedly "scared" kids treating their situation like a game. I finished off the remaining 45 minutes watching static with a smile on my face.
