Thsi is one of those movies that was at some point in my earlier childhood that i was obsessed with.I mean this was my favorite movie at the times.Now ill go back and look at this, and obviously I don't love it as much as I did, but I still like it a lot.This film is just so good, and so enjoyable that I can see why I liked it the way I did.Well, now that i understand the film more, i realize that there was some stuff that was not really necessary, and it was a bit to long, but its still a good movie.This movie is just so much fun, and good that its very lovable that anyone could find at least something they liked.Every now and then ill watch this, and remember why I fell in love with this great and funny movie.Overall its a good movie that can be enjoyed by anybody, and is worth a viewing from. 9.1 out of 10 stars
