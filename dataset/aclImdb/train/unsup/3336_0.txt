I have an odd way of picking up movies. Usually by the cover and or summary on the box. For the most part I do well with this method. Well, today was not one of them days. The movie had nice action sequences but the acting was by far some of the worst I have ever seen. It was absolutely horrible. It is sad because the story was really decent and had possible potential. I wouldn't rate this movie a one out of ten just because the tunnel scenes were good and kept me in the movie. If you believe in Vietnam movies should show Americans winning every battle then this movie is definitely not for you. Although, I wont be re-watching this one in the near future. If war movies are your thing. I would recommend a movie called Tae-gu-ki. It is a great Korean war movie.
