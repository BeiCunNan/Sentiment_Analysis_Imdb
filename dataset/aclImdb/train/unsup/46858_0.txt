Watch the clean-cut young guy eat dinner with his family. Watch them watching TV. Watch the same guy driving a car. Watch him get dressed. All this is acted Robot-like by a no-name actor who is a dead ringer for Matt Damon, without the acting talent. Yes, there's violence because he goes on a shooting spree and kills many people. But that's IT. I mean, there's no plot, no suspense, no anything. There IS a lot of dead space in this movie.<br /><br />If you love watching a pasty, boring dude eating a sandwich.....driving a car.....walking......etc., then this movie is for you!! Before seeing this movie I read the raving reviews. I thought my favorite actor, Boris Karloff, was in it and the reviews were good...so I spent almost two hours being BORED TO DEATH.<br /><br />NO GUN NECESSARY.
