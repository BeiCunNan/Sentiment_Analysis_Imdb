I have read all the comments posted here and I am surprised to see that no one of you ever mention John Denver as part of this movie music track, only Olivia Newton-Jones is mentioned. Don't you guys ever remember..."Lady, my sweet lady.." I saw this movie in mid 70' while living overseas. The tittle was "A window to the sky" subtitled "Una Ventana Al Cielo".<br /><br />My friend Fernando Tabilo and I were on the phone talking about this film and he said to me that he has not been able to get a hold of a DVD of this film, or seen it played on a movie channel. Frankly, me neither, and I have not even looked for one, for I was the movie house projectionist and I saw the movie enough times to remember about it many years to come.
