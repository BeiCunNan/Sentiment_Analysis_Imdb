This is one of my ultimate favourite films. It is not about the action but the fact that the main character is a sociopath. The film puts so much detail into how he is to commit the act just to see if he 'feels' anything and shows how unemotional he really is (this is the scary part). He chooses the worst crime he can think of (being a claustrophobic) and then plans it meticulously. The ending is shocking when you put all the pieces together of what he has done earlier in the film leading up to this, even involving his children screaming to see how far it travels! I think the remake ruins the whole premise and meaning of the film and advise anyone to watch this one. He shows no remorse just a morbid curiosity of other peoples emotions.<br /><br />Truly a cold calculating scary man.
