... and it focus on the mainstream manipulation. The Manipulation Of Mass Media.<br /><br />Society today isn't ready to see this kind of stuff, this kind of movie, this kind of reality. I have to say the movie surprised me, in the good way, of course. Instead, on one hand the movie sucked, but on the other hand it was like one of the most important movies of all times! From Oliver Stone, master of controversial films, there is a piece of cinema which some of us may call crap or others call it art!<br /><br />Your choice. <br /><br />The movie tells us about two psychotic lovers, who kill everyone in their way just to strength their love for each other. As the movie grows, their passion grows too. They were sent to prison, they were ready to be sent to a psychiatric asylum, but... the main theme of this film get ready to action: the media. The media get in the way of this two killers, trying to manipulate people to like them and to earn money by making them superstars.<br /><br />A controversial movie which may be sadistic to everyone; or masterpiece to other ones.<br /><br />Enjoy it if you can!
