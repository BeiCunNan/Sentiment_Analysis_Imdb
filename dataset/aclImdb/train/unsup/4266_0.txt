How unfortunate to spend time on these sort of inadequate movies. I suppose Butterfly Effect was even a better movie at least it was more entertaining than this one. The Script was bad and inadequate, acting was terrible the actors must have picked up on a rush or they didn't have enough budget for good ones. Neither of Simon (Phillippe) i suppose due to the script and director, Dr. Newman (Rea), Anna (Perabo), Claire (Polley) or Peter (Leonard) could act, i think the only good actors in this movie was Mr. Travit(Lang) the patient and Nurse Clayton (Ayola). The opening was like trying to create a suspense which fails and the audience were literally pushed to that suspicion other than naturally creating the atmosphere, he killed Mr. Travit and he was there in the future and suddenly started to bleed, he banged Anna's had and she had the bleeding in the future all of a sudden which does not correspond with the other events if u changed the past it happens so you wont see it in the future, it would be the past. The ending was meaningless does it mean he has another chance and why Dr. Newman was his father then became Dr. Newman again in the ending... such a waste of time and money...
