This ranks as one of the few documentaries, along with Littlest Soldier, where his politics and German Guilt are most direct. Usually he limits himself to studies of character, individuals. This one is about the character of modern warfare and brings up memories of The Doors' When the Music's Over, and reference to Apocalypse Now. Herzog flies in a helicopter, through oil fires, playing Wagner, and reading from the Apocalypse. This is a filmaker's documentary of life imitating art imitating life. Even if you don't think real images of scenes usually reserved for horror movies are moving, the photography of the colors of the sun through the smoke and fire is stunning. And those who think it's politics are one sided should note the equally graphic details of the results of both sides' work. For those that don't remember, there was a little action in the Persian Gulf in 1991.
