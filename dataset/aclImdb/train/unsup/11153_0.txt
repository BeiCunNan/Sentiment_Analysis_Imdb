That is the real deal! I do not know way too many things about artistic side of the actors and how they suppose to act while a movie, but I know this: I've been in bondage and God has set me free This is what the movie industry should be all about. Movies that are powerful, inspirational, makes you take the right decisions after a life of wrong ones or after a life where other has done wrong decisions for you.<br /><br />I know that Mel Gibson have done the Passion and there has been some others that are trying to be God's voice for this humanity that calls for a change of hearts. If the world will not pay attention, that will be its end. If the world will listen carefully to God's Word through these movies, and others like them, we can make this place a better place. <br /><br />Gaby
