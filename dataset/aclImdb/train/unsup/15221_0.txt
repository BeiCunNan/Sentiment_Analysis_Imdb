Basically this movie tells us the most horrifying thing that can happen to you in a bar with your friends. The teens in the movie are quite innocent, and absolutely do not guess that; people can be that much barbarian and heartless. A small excuse can start this brutality and exactly happens like this in the movie.<br /><br />You have to be stabilized and strong when you are watching this movie because it contains rapes,cutoffs,beating apparently. And the acting is very realistic which can disturb you, maybe can turn you as nightmares.<br /><br />They shot the film in a bar at Taksim, when I pass from there I feel horrified.<br /><br />However at the end, you calmed down a little bit, at least you see 'crime does not pay'
