I found myself constantly trying to find something wrong with this film through the duration of it because I knew better than to be liking it so much - but i couldn't help it. I kept thinking that with some decent actors this script had great potential. It did of course have its typical t.v movie flaws but you learn to except those eventually. I must admit the one let down I will stick with is the not so brilliant title. It's really got nothing to do with the film and it certainly doesn't make you say "I need to watch this film." <br /><br />The twists and turns this movie take will keep you on edge right to the last shot. I even loved the last scene so much it took this from an 8 to a 9 so stay tuned right until the end credits flash up.
