Although the aforementioned film is not without its OWN hiccoughs as far as I'm concerned, (I rated it one notch higher than this) THAT'S the post-war lifestyle I wanna go back to and experience vicariously! Consisting of 'hot-roddin' and juvenile japes with your mates; and not - as "Diner" offers us - a bunch of wastrels lazily sprawled around a table spouting cod-philosophy and acting like the lost aristocrats of their youth. (That's when they're not projecting an 'earthier' vibe as an act to try and get laid, of course... !) The only historic thing about this movie, to my mind, is the number of players that this proved to be a breakthrough for. Sad then, really, that some of them have regressed only to parodying aspects of their personality in this. (Reiser, Guttenberg) Mickey Rourke, however, gives the most natural and vivid performance of his career - and so early on, too! The Diner is the gang's own little retreat; unfortunately, it seemed 'Closed Indefinitely' to people like me. That is - in cinematic terms, at least - someone who prefers to see people try and face up to their inadequacies, rather than perpetually running away from them...
