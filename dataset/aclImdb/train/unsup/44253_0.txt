I saw this film at a student theater and I was completely underwhelmed by it. The acting is terrible (were they actors?)and the only part of the production that didn't make me laugh was the jokes.<br /><br />Spudmonkey? What type of a title is that? The story is lifted directly from 'Hollywood's clich√© underdog story writing' manual, yet the writer/director still manages to destroy this basic formula.<br /><br />All the characters are so hollow that it is hard to offer even an ounce of care factor, and the original music was horrible to listen to.<br /><br />The $2 that was wasted on the making of this movie may have been better invested on a lotto ticket. I hope the director of this film (can you call it that?) is ashamed of himself.
