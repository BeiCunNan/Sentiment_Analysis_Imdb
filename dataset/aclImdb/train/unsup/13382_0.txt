A reasonable religious movie not billed as such. When I saw this movie at Blockbuster, it seemed to be a reasonable light family type movie. Instead it is a nearly 2 hour informercial for LDS/Mormons. I have nothing against LDS, but did not want to nor was interested in being proselytized to. Unfortunate that Disney could not have been more forthcoming about what this movie is really about.
