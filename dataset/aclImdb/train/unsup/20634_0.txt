Poor Joan has been turned into a freakish cartoon in recent years, but every now and then you stumble upon a movie that only Joan could play, and play well. In "Possessed," she even dares to wear very little make up in the opening scene. She must have taken a page from Bette's book while at Warner's. The only problem I have with the movie is that it's rather long. I kept looking at my watch and wondering when is this going to be over? You have to accept the bubblegum psychology this movie spews out but it might have been something of a groundbreaking film when it came out. Despite some of these flaws, this movie is still fun to watch as Joan becomes more delusional in each scene. And what's a Joan Crawford movie without her packing heat in her purse?
