This movie was so bad that it was almost painful to watch. I have no idea why Sam Elliott would star in this bubbling half'gallon of foul swamp water. This film makes one actually wish for a snake bite; at least the Fade To Black would come mercifully sooner! The film involves a stupid family of rich, white, republican racists who do nothing but drink huge quantities of hard liquor while complaining about all the 'swamp noise'. Of course, if the refugees from the '700 Club' didn't like the sound of frogs and birds, they should have stayed in Houston or some other Red State conclave.<br /><br />The rich idiots in this film earn nature's wrath by dumping poison into the swamp in order to 'quiet things down'. Nature fights back by sending snakes, crocodiles, and strangling vines to kill the GOP interlopers. My only regret is that Nature doesn't behave like this in real life. we could do well with fewer stupid, rich white people who somehow get their money for free.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is terrible, as is the direction and the sound. The only redeeming factor is Sam Elliott as the Environmentalist. besides this, you'd get more enjoyment out of watching 'Swamp Thing'.<br /><br />As a footnote: Maybe the acting was actually dead'on. After all, they did portray rich republicans as oily, amoral, wastrels who would cheerfully destroy th'e environment in order to suit their immediate wants. that's par for the course.
