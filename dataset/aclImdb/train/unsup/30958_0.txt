A very good movie! First, the plot listed is incorrect. He does not escape from a prison in Alabama, but rather the state prison in Huntsville, Texas, (the author apparently got their "Huntsvilles" mixed up and assumed it was Alabama.) There is, in fact, a prison in Huntsville, TX, and the entire movie takes place in Texas & Mexico. A lot of action, albeit, the plot's outcome is apparent throughout. Still, this movie has an outstanding cast for a low-budget film and the original music by John Schneider is excellent. I would definitely recommend this to any fan of Kirk Douglas, John Schneider, or just your average action-movie-without-all-the-big-time-Hollywood-promotion stuff. I would say it is along the lines of movies such as "Lone Wolf McQuade", "Hunter's Blood", or "Avenging Force", all great movies without a lot of hype!
