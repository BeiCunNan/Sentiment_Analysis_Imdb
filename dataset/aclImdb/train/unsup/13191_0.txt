I am not ashamed to admit it here, but this is one of my all time favorite movies. Kurt Russell and Kris Kristofferson are great together. Very little cussing, lots of love, nothing objectionable, and Manny's faith in God all make for a great family film.<br /><br />In addition, I have loved Elizabeth Shue since Karate Kid. I could look at her all day.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts in the film is where Kurt and Dakota are discussing Sonador's run that they just had witnessed. Kurt says something about how well she did in spite of her being big, referring to the horse's weight. Dakota looks at him with a slight smirk and replies "What do you mean?" Kurt refers to the Popsicles that Dakota had been feeding the horse. The scene has Dakota looking in the other direction (away from the camera). This whole scene was unrehearsed and was a practical joke by Kurt on Dakota, which worked so well, the director/writer left it in the film. That's what great films are made of.
