I went to a screening of Spook in Vancouver on April 9th at the Havana. We had seen a very appealing ad in a newspaper, showing the movie. Seeing that it has won awards and was controversial, we were interested to see it. It was a disappointment. My husband and I were not impressed. It was actually painful to sit through. We found the movie very long and very boring at times. This is something that could never be mass produced or shown in a commercial theatre. People would just not pay the money. It was drawn out and very hard to follow at times. The lighting throughout the movie was terrible. When the lights came on at the end, it was a great relief. The lead role acting was OK. I would not waste your time viewing this.
