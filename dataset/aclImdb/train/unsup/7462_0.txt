This movie isn't bad if your comparing it to Wesley Snipes' DTV movie The Detonator. They both score about a 1 out of 10. This movie is absolutely awful!! The plot...there isn't one, not that I could find anyway. If you watch this, DON'T RENT, and find a plot please let me know what it is because while watching the 84 minutes of this trash, in between the horrible acting and watching Seagal being out of breath, I couldn't find one.<br /><br />Now lets talk about the scenes a little. Seagal (John Seeger, who's the genius who came up with that one) in one scene goes to "punch" someone in the bathroom and you can see obviously that he doesn't, I mean the guy he's trying to hit isn't even in the picture, and there's a punching sound. Where's the editing director?!?! Must have been cut to pay for Seagal's drinking/smoking habit. Anyway, another one is the same scene Seagal is throws this guy into a stall in the men's bathroom and knocks the stall off the wall and no water comes splashing out. There's not even a hole in the wall where the pipe goes. I guess Seagal didn't want to get wet or the floor because his fat a$$ may have fallen down and not gotten back up. There are many others but I just keep getting more and more mad the more I think about how awful this crap was. Seagal is supposed to be some bad-a$$ mercenary but he can't even talk without being out of breath. I just couldn't accept the fact that he's supposed to be some mercenary. And speaking of mercenaries, who has ever heard of a "Good" mercenary. That's like saying a good murderer. They just don't go together. Terrible, simply terrible.<br /><br />Don't rent don't even give it the benefit of the doubt and certainly don't contribute to Seagal's drinking/smoking habit.
