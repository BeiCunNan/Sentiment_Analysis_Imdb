I must say I have just watched this film and admit to having tears in my eyes whilst watching, unusual for me.<br /><br />It managed to take a 'Brewsters Millions' theme and turn it into something far more emotional, a drama rather that a comedy. Although the film could be in danger of being over sentimental and corny I did not find it so, I believe it delivered the messages in a simple and understated way that made them believable. This is a heart warming story that I would rather watch any day than some of the big budget, special effects laden blockbusters that leave you devoid of any real emotion at the end of the film.<br /><br />I would thoroughly recommend to those who want just a little depth to stories in the cinema.
