The dregs. I rated this movie on the portion I watched--I turned this off before it was over. I'm scarred by the amount I watched. Stay away--this is the pits. I was passing through and caught this on Starz! and aside from paying for the monthly subscription fee for Starz!, I am certainly glad I didn't rent this or (God forbid!) pay to see this in the theater. I realize films (!) like this are made strictly for release on DVD and cater to a specific crowd, but this one was simply pathetic. I'm no high-brow--I enjoy goof-ball flicks (Dude, Where's My Car?) as much as the next person, but this just seemed lazy. I got the feeling the writers (!) pirated a do-it-yourself "teen movie" template from a website and just plugged in their own specifics. And they failed. This movie is tired and clich√©d and populated with bad acting. My REAL rating is less than the 1 star I gave it...
