This movie is full of fun; Cary Grant and Myrna Loy should have had more comedy roles together! If you liked Cary in "Bringing Up Baby" and Myrna in "Love Crazy" you will enjoy this one. Even your teenagers will like this(although they may roll their eyes in disbelief when they find out its in black and white!). The movie is a tasty blend of slapstick humor, the perils of interpersonal relationships and a particularly brilliant bit of artifice involving a mantel and a doll-(keep an eye out for it towards the end of the movie-it happens rather quickly!) I suppose it sounds trite to say it-but this film is just plain, good, old-fashioned, clean fun. I think it is a timeless classic that will continue to appeal to audiences in the future.
