One of the better films I've seen in a long time, totally not LaChapelle's style, but as Littlepirate stated this, he must not have watched all the commentary, as to why and how he shot it, without tons of lighting, and using a cameraman with a home brew backpack steady-cam. Its not anything like his Christian Agularia's videos. Its unique and the DVD's bonuses made it a definite must buy. Rent the movie, and watch the extras, and believe me, you'll want to go buy a copy for yourself. Amazing dance moves, and those that say it's just a seizure, well probably don't dance. ( different moves are explained in the extras section, they are not just shaking around, there are actually steps to their dances). Tommy the Clown is an inspiration to see, he could leave and actually progress his way of life, but instead chooses to stay and help out the youth in the inner city, this man should be given an award for his courage. (even after being robbed, he still stuck it through).
