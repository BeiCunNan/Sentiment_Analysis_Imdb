Dumb and Dumber is one of the funniest movies of the '90's, at least, that I have ever seen!!! Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels work together perfectly to make this movie earn a 10!! Jim Carrey is the best actor in the world and one of these days, he has to be nominated for one of his works, he has done so much and has shown that he can do more than silly, toilet-humor comedies. Anyway, Dumb and Dumber is a must see for everyone (except for maybe little kiddies, their parents might want to think twice, but hey, I say, start the tykes early and show them what good humor is!) It's also educational for me, we watched it in high school two years in a row, now isn't that awesome? Or maybe my school is just weird cause we watch Bill and Ted, too. I think Dumb and Dumber is one of Jim Carrey's best works!
