When I first saw this movie, I was deeply touched. Its an awesome movie that everyone of all ages should see. I could watch it over and over again and never get tired of seeing it. I like the music that was composed in this movie. The girl who played Mary Lennox is an extremely good actress. Its a movie that will make you laugh and cry and touch your heart at the same time. I really love this movie and the book as well. Both are very breathtaking. Its definitely a must-see kind of movie. Whoever hasn't seen this movie should definitely see it its worth it!! From the beginning to the end there was never a dull moment of this movie.
