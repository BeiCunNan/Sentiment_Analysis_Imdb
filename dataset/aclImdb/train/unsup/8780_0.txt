This is the most immersing game I've ever played. The graphics are awesome, the action appears realistic and you do have to fight to the death. I like the fact that this game takes place during the Allied push to rid the world of those dreaded Nazis. The only reason I can't give it 10 out of 10 is that the missions are, in my opinion, too short. It seems that you start a level and quickly finish it even at the hardest setting. Well, I guess I'm better than I think. Mind you, I also play on-line with friends every Monday night. All in all, extraordinary game with punch ! Also, it was great to actually see a King Tiger tank in the game giving it a more realistic feel to it as in reality, the German forces did possess some units of that dreaded armor in the field. Contrary to some other comments I've read about the game in general, I didn't find the various accents throughout it to be annoying or anything. Well, that's just me, I Guess !
