Sheffield 1977 and 18 year old pen-pusher Vince Smith fancies himself as a Saturday Night Fever styled disco king, but the object of his affection, Joanna, is more interested in Johnny Rotton than John Travolta.<br /><br />While spineless Vince wrestles with his conscience, his downtrodden father, Harold, reveals a hitherto undeclared talent for magic that is nearer to the X-Files than the spoon-bending antics of Uri Geller. And when a fatal incident in a residential home brings him to the publics attention, Joanna's pompous scientist father surprisingly declares him a walking miracle! Featuring cameos from such '70s icons as Angela Rippon, John Craven, Keith Chegwin, Jan Leeming, Alan Whicker and Lulu (as Vince's wayward mum), Courtenay is a likeable Smith, and the film has all the ingredients for a warm, quirky romantic comedy, but sadly, it all fails to gel.<br /><br />Whatever happened indeed!
