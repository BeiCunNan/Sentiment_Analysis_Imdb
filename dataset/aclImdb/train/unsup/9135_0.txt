I love that UNLIKE movies like "Snow White" and "Sleeping Beauty," the main characters in this movie don't fall in love by first glance. They get to know each other and fall in love gradually. Not like in "Snow White" where Snow White and Prince Charming fall in love because they both think that the other is hot. That sort of thing doesn't happen in real life, if someone in real life loved someone else without even knowing their name. I'de feel really, really, really bad for that couple. And the movie has great music and songs, most of the characters are lovable. And it's just a great movie. It's definitely a Disney classic that you have to watch.
