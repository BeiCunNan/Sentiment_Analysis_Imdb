Johnathon Schaech stars and co-wrote the 'teleplay' for this movie,It is from a novel by Ed Gorman.This is a mystery story that could have been much better. The general tale has been done too many times already to maintain any suspense or real mystery. <br /><br />Another point that dooms this film is that none of the people are very good or interesting & I for one was unable to care one bit on what occurred. NOTE I have not mentioned any of the cast names<br /><br />As I said in the above summary the best thing is the running time.including credits only 82 minutes.<br /><br />The acting is only fair, same for the production, there is nothing I can recommend here.<br /><br />OK I have my 10 lines,.<br /><br />Ratings: ** (out of 4) 52 points(out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)
