Where did that 8 rating come from? Must be someone with a wishful attempt to get viewers. I refuse to waste more time even reviewing it. Stay home and read a book. Surely you will be better of. IMDb requires you to write @ least ten lines of comments and that is exactly what I am doing. For the sake of anyone who might take the time to go ever these lines before deciding whether or not to see it. I have not sat through such kind of film for a long, long time. There is definitively a waste of talent and resources used in this film. Literally I mean it!!! Somehow I felt that they were trying to demonstrate their superiority over the viewers, in a flagrant way, and get away with it. There is no value whatsoever in this movie and if there is it escapes me. I take that back there is value in it.<br /><br />Once you are done viewing it you realize how important is time and even when we allocate time for purposes of pure entertainment, and just that one has to chose wisely. I regret not spending such time watching another movie instead. This is the first time I review a movie on IMDb and I am taking the time, as I said before, to spare someone the torture.
