I got the movie a couple of years ago, on a double pack. It's bad. There's only one good thing about this movie: It's so bad it's funny (for example, the scene with the flamethrower). The plot is OK. It's about presidential elections coming up, and we are introduced to the current president, who wants to win again, but he is quite unpopular. The FBI, or whatever it's called in this movie, try to let everybody think he gets captured, and then gets free again to improve his popularity. But then some terrorists real capture him, and it's up to "The Replacement", or "The guy in the tuxedo" to rescue him.<br /><br />There are some scenes which are just really stupid, like the scene with the flamethrower, the scene at the swimming pool, the helicopter that crashes, the same car that explodes twice, etc.<br /><br />The scene with the flamethrower is just hilarious. It begins with some kind of Face Off with the bad guy (played by a certain Bryan Genesse) and The Replacement. First you see The Replacement from a distance. Then it swaps to a closer angle, and you see him closer. It goes to another angle, and then we only see his face. That piece is just unbelievably funny, but you have to see it before you know how funny it is. Then you see this bad guy shoot at The Replacement with a flamethrower, and The Replacement runs through the exact same door 3 times, the only thing that changes is the angle that it's filmed from.<br /><br />There is also some FBI guy who leads some "special agents" and "tries to rescue the president". Well, actually, he does almost nothing. And those "special agents" are so bad, they're more like random people who volunteered to hold guns.<br /><br />And what's also really funny is the part where the bad guy falls off the roof. The camera swaps to the FBI guy, who just casually stands and looks a the guy falling from a high rise building.<br /><br />So, if you want a great comedy, get this movie. But if you want a action movie, don't bother about this one.<br /><br />2/10
