It's not too often that a movie comes along that is so bad it makes me angry... but this is one.<br /><br />I kept waiting for a laugh that never came, and was further insulted by the non-committal soundtrack. Was it supposed to insinuate girl-power? Maybe if you like country/rock uplifting go-girl artists... maybe its just me.<br /><br />Mike Myers absolutely stole the few scenes he did appear in, but wasn't enough to make this movie bearable. And although it was painted a la Down With Love, it did nothing to uphold the style statement it seemed to be trying to make. <br /><br />ooooh pink and blue! It stunk.
