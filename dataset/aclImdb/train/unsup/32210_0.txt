This one makes you laugh even if you don't want to: hilarious from tip to toe, its segmentation works perfectly and makes us want to see more at the end. A perfect comic timing and clever jokes make this one a winner, with unbelievable performances, characters and stories. My favorites are the italian story and the episode in the inside of the human body. Truly great!
