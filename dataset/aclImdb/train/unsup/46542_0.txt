Umrao Jaan Ada was a much awaited movie for all of us!!especially for young generation to re feel the magic woven in a novel in 1905!! But it was big let down with Lack Lustrous performances by everybody-be it the director,dialog writer, music director ,lyricist or as a matter of fact the protagonist herself! The screenplay had its own flaws-being fast at those scenes which required to be handled with sensitivity and being slow at scenes which were deliberately screeched to monotonous dialogs! The saving grace were glimpses of Abhishek Bachchan -which unfortunately left viewers in lurch to ask for more of his screen space!!! The length of the movie was too much...viewers got bored with same kind of costumes and same kind of lyrics...All the songs sound similar!! (SOMETHING NOT EXPECTEDOUT OF JAVED AKHTAR AND ANU MALIK) I'd however not like to compare the movie with the 1981 Muzaffar Ali creation.......as it would be an insult to the original magic spelled by the pioneers like Muzaffar Ali and Rekha.
