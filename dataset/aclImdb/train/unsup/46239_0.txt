the most pathetic, embarrasing and overrated director in DK. People do not dare to say anything else about Dreyers films than "they are SOOOO FANTASTIC". It is so called "Directed good taste", and I loathe it!!!! Wake up - and see what it is! It is not about faith, it is about delution.So many directors have made far better films about faith, and they are not pathetic!!!!
