Christopher Lambert stars as a man in the near future and his wife is pregnant for the 2nd time but that is illegal because of a population control and they are trying to escape to Mexico but they get caught and sent to a maximum security futuristic prison called the Fortress for 31 years.It is said that it is imposable to escape from this prison but against all the odds Christopher Lamberts character plans to escape from the prison with his wife and some of his friends.<br /><br />I have seen most of Christopher Lamberts movies and this movie called Fortress has to be one of his best movies he has ever done.There are heaps of great action scenes in this movie and the most memorable scenes are the scenes in the end of the movie when Christopher Lamberts Character and his friends are trying to escape the prison and Christopher is shooting all of the prison guards to escape.<br /><br />Over all this is a great Sci-Fi/Action movie and i highly recommend that u rent or even buy this movie.And my rating for this movie is seven out of ten.
