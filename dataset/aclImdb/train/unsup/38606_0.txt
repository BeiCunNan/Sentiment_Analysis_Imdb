You think Plan 9 from Outer Space is bad. It can not hold a candle to this one. A stupid, mind numbing, poorly acted, badly shot film that never should have been made. The story makes no sense and has bad pacing. The fight scenes are slow, infrequent, and poorly done. I can not believe Sean Connary agreed to appear in the movie. His part is about 6 minutes and he did die in the first one, not that the writers payed any attention to that little fact. It may have been explained but the movie is so dull I was probably asleep. Please spare yourself and avoid the movie.
