Why was this movie made? No doubt to sucker in the family-rebelling MTV faithful, many of whom do not care about anything other than the exterior of a movie - in Go the story about drugs and sex, and the crude humor. While the plot line of the movie is interesting, the unsympathetic and underdeveloped characters give us nothing to care about.<br /><br />What is most bothersome is that at the end of the movie nobody learns anything. This movie would have been much better if it had a point. It makes brief and ambivalent references to family life, but never really has the guts to develop its critiques.<br /><br />I guess what makes this movie so pathetic is that every character is like all the other characters. What's worse, never in the film, not even at the climax, do any characters distinguish themselves. The four men in Vegas hardly differ at all, and the three convenience store workers are all the same. If you want to waste your 7 bucks on uninspiring and forgettable slop, Go is waiting for you.
