this PBS series is very BIAS and contains a lot of lies and false information. It sounds like it presents the war from both sides but really it just conforms to much of the media bias about the war and even adds to it.<br /><br />**NOTE** A 1985 video was produced by ACCURACY IN MEDIA to directly correct many of the inaccuracies and false information that were contained within this video series.<br /><br />One example is the massacre of Hue where around 5,000 people were murdered 1968. On this issue "Vietnam: A Television History" uses a communist spokesmen, Hoang Phu Ngoc Tuong, (who is believed to may have been the one who ordered the killings) to explain the deaths as 'the people of Hue so hated those that had tortured them for so long that when the revolution came to Hue the people took actions into their own hands, there was little we could do'. This just shows how completely irresponsible the PBS was as expressed by Pham Ngoc Bich "Hoang Phu Ngoc Tuong may have been the one to order the killings...now years later he is allowed to explain about what happened in Hue, it's equivalent to Himmler talking about the concentration camps." --Anyone who watches this video should definitely also watch Television's Vietnam: The Real Story, and The Media's Impact because that video would break so many of the lies contained in the PBS series.
