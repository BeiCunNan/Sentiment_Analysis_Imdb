I have to admit I watched it to the very end - barely -without falling asleep! <br /><br />This is not a repulsive bad movie, but an annoying one! The acting is so universally horrible, I said to myself, "I could do a better job - where do I sign-up?" This thought entered my mind so often I started wondering how much these godforsaken actors where paid for their severe lack of skills! For them it must be a thrill to know you at least made it to DVD, even if you never made to the big screen! But for the rest of us watching Darkstorm it was terribly distracting! <br /><br />The special effects were enjoyable and the fantasy element was interesting. It's a shame who ever directed and produced this film didn't pony-up some more bucks to get some real acting talent! This could have been a half way decent sci-fi/fantasy film!
