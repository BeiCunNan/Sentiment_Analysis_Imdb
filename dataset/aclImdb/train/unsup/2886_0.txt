Quagmire didn't used to be one of my favorite episodes until I began to enjoy the humor of the X-Files more. I love this episode for the many in-jokes and the great Mulder and Scully dialogue. Especially when they get stranded on the rock near the end and their conversation runs from cannibalism to Moby Dick to metaphors about Mulder and a peg leg. One of the better in-jokes of the episode is the reappearance of the stoner kids from War of the Coprophages. "Oh... No..." Another in-joke which references back to Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose is that Scully brings along the dog Queequeg who she adopted when the original owner dies in that episode. Unfortunately the dog meets its demise in this episode. Interestingly both of these in-jokes reference back to episodes written by the great comedy episode writer Darrin Morgan however this particular episode is not written by him. It is written by Chris Carter and Kim Newton. Possibly a tribute to a good writer or perhaps he was involved with the Story Editing as he was with so many other episodes. While not necessarily one of the better episodes as far as creepiness or paranormal this is one of the funner episodes to watch. It is tame enough to use as an episode to break others in to the show. I give it a 9 out of 10.
