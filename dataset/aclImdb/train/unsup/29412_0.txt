Last of the Summer Wine doesn't come on until 11 pm on the local PBS station, but it's always worth the lack of sleep.<br /><br />It's a rare comedy nowadays that can be genuinely funny without being crude. The three old men at the center of the show are constantly involved in antics worthy of Lucille Ball. The wide array of supporting characters are representative of real-life characters to be found in any small town in any country, which is probably why it appeals to me, a girl from a small town in the Midwestern United States.<br /><br />It's heartwarming, funny, and for the entire family. What more could you want?
