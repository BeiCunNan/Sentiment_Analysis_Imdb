Now i don't say this because of the possible getting shot in the head in an initiation to a sorority (yeah, i know. it's stupid) i say this because if you join this sorority, you may end up in the movie "Sisters of Death" and that my friend, is worse than a gun shot to the head.<br /><br />Welcome to number 14 on our 50 movie list of "Chilling Classics" and well, you're in for another less than mediocre film. We begin with what looks like an initiation to like a satanic cult, but it's actually a sorority. (They only have 4 members?) and for some reason they show their courage by having a fake gun put against their head and the trigger pulled. but uh oh, in a really obvious twist the gun kills one of the girls! oh noez! oh no wait. that was totally expected...anyway, the movie then skips to 7 years later.<br /><br />What happens then you may ask? why they each get a note saying to meet at this place! and they all think that they're from each other. when they get there they get taken by two random goofy guys to the house where they're supposed to meet. so they arrive and... almost immediately the father of the dead girl says that they're going to find out tomorrow who really killed his daughter. The girls get freaked out and try to leave but there's an electrical fence so pfff. that ideas gone. So anyway the girls begin getting picked off one by one and even one of the annoying guys! yay! until finally the killer gets owned by a random pistol shot which she couldn't have possibly hit him with and he dies. and as we think they're all safe, the girl shoots the other guy and freeze frame. So now we know she was really the killer. WHY she killed people we have absolutely no idea.<br /><br />the main problems with this movie are as follows. 1. the ending was stupid. it didn't resolve ANYTHING and i wanted to see the chick die. and she didn't. 2. NONE of these characters were likable. every one was whiny, stupid, and insipid. you were rooting for the killer to kill ALL of them so we didn't have to live with their stupidity. cause then at least the movie would have been over quicker.<br /><br />3. despite the fact that they know the guy on the grounds is trying to kill them, they do nothing to fight against him! they just slowly die. because they're retarded.<br /><br />4. they KEEP SPLITTING UP! if one of your friends die every time you leave them alone....WHY WOULD YOU KEEP LEAVING THEM ALONE?! seriously. retards.<br /><br />5. the two male characters didn't belong in this movie and made it goofy and stupid Whatever. this movie could have been good, but there were too many parts with nothing happening. it wasn't the worst thing i've ever seen, but that would be saying a lot if it was.<br /><br />So in the end, "Sisters of Death" gets 3 dead sorority girls, out of 10.
