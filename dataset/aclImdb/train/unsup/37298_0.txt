This was so Hollywood. Julia Roberts goes to Mongolia... What can I say, please Julia, stick to your role as a shallow actress, you play that role good. However, that role doesn't quite fit in this so-called documentary about Mongolia. Julia goes something like: "There are no fences here, the horses stay because of respect..." Well, in my opinion, the horses stay because they are in need of food, which they get from the horsemen, the law of nature or something. Anyway, I kind of liked her acting in Pretty Woman, just to say something nice.
