Kisna is one of the most awful movies that I have seen...No thank you to some of the people who wrote good comments about this movie.It's a sheer waste of time and energy to sit through this load of crap, even if someone offers you a free screening or DVD of this movie...please,please AVOID IT. There is Nothing Good to write about this movie.I wish I had a Time Machine to get back my few hours that I wasted watching this JUNK. Anyone who watches this movie will consider Indian Cinema to be a Big Joke and movie making at it's unprofessional and non-artistic best. How I wish IMDb had negative marking and I would have rated this movie at -10 out of 10
