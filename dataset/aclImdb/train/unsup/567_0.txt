Drive Thru is one of the top 5 horror movies of all time in my book. Everything comes together so well - the fast paced action, the subtle political innuendos, and the suspenseful plot twists are all perfectly balanced to create the ideal horror movie experience.<br /><br />The actors all play their roles to perfection - Jan and Hunter from the office!!! - and the soundtrack is nothing short of spectacular. The character meet their deaths in a widely entertaining variety of ways (mostly involving a clown with an axe).<br /><br />The guy from Supersize Me makes a highly ironic cameo as a fast food cashier, which was a great creative casting twist.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!! Snape kills Dumbledore!<br /><br />You will be left speechless at the end of the movie, which has a twist of a magnitude unheard of since the Sixth Sense. I am anxiously awaiting the sequel, Drive Thru 2 starring Keanu Reeves.
