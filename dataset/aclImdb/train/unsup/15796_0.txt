Only days following its New York premiere, "For the Bible Tells Me So" plays Cinematheque, Cleveland Ohio's superb film series.<br /><br />A capacity audience sits attentively through this informative feature, responding audibly to its content and ending with loud applause. I found the work well prepared and executed, offering varying points of view on the subject of morality and religiosity.<br /><br />Famed world leaders from far left to far right are given time to express their varied opinions, while the viewer is allowed to reach a personal conclusion. The presentation is comprehensive and fair minded in delineating key points of scripture that are used to judge sexual orientation and practices.<br /><br />A film worthy of extensive screening, especially in churches of all denominations as well as civic organizations. Ultimately, it's a most valuable addition to any film collection.
