Seriously, when I first saw the styling of the new baby dragon, I expected it to swallow a turtle any moment on the way and sprout angel wings. It looks too much like Yoshi, like a baby and the sad thing is that I have yet only talked about the dragon.<br /><br />Christopher Masterson and Robby Benson are spectacularly out of talent during this lot, a spineless cast trying to bare the weight of complete and utter failure. The underdog recipe has been tried honestly for over a thousand times, on twenty different types of movies, but in most cases, this one included, it does not inspire pity nor does it add something to the experience of watching this.<br /><br />Then there are the brace of peeps that watch this thing for its special effects; trust me when I say that they are quite bad. So... is there anything at all making it you worthwhile to watch this? <br /><br />No.
