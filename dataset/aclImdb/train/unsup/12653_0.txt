It is set up in Northern Alaska with a crew that is supposed to be stalked by a unseen evil. <br /><br />After paying $10.00 for this movie and then setting and watching it for a 101 minutes, I ended up wasting money and time. This movie was awful I kept waiting and waiting for a scare or anything but it didn't deliver.<br /><br />When it finally tried to deliver it was if they were haunted by ghost moose???? You have to be kidding me. The special effects were even awful, they could have did a better job by far.<br /><br />Please do not waste your time or money on this movie.
