There are some okay sections of this piece, but then we have characters acting and reacting to things in ways that make no sense at all. I lived in San Antonio for a few years in college, so I was familiar with the famous "Ghost Tracks" that are on the south side of SA. On a road called "Shane," I believe, that is sandwiched between two huge burial parks(Fitting). Anyway, it was good to see an attempt at writing something based on that area and story, but there were just too many places with characters doing things that make no sense at all. There is some bad acting in this film too. An overall good attempt at making a film, it just needed some work to the script and to the directing in parts.
