I had watched this movie Kisses And Caroms and was soooo reminded of Clerks that I had to re-watch Clerks. And Clerks still is great today. It was interesting to compare it to Kisses And Caroms, both were first features, both are one location, both are about 2 guys, but Kisses and Caroms has hot naked women in it. I suspected that these clerks guys had something to do with it, but I'm told no.<br /><br />Anyway, I watched an old copy on Laser Disc, but a buddy told me about the new improved DVD. I guess I'll be watching that soon.<br /><br />I loved the movies crude and simple humor. It was a nice trip down memory lane. I kept thinking oh yeah, this is where this happens. Then, I'd laugh. I also heard they're making a part 2. That seems to be odd, but hey Terminator 2 was made years after part 1, so I guess they can pull it off, it'll be interesting to see how they do it.<br /><br />I did think the opening dragged on a bit this time. It seemed to take forever to get behind the counter. And that whiny "I have a game at 2" bit was forced in the opening call. I thought I remembered Jay and Silent Bob in more of it, but I guess not. Maybe the new DVD has more then the Laser Disc had.
