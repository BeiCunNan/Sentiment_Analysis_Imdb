I remember seeing this film when i was about 8 or 9 in the early 1970s. I was scared stiff then but now look back on the memories and laugh. I discuss with my teenager kids about all the old hammer horror films that i used to watch from the 50s,60s and 70s.Im trying to get a copy of this film and any other films with the Faceless Man titles. ( black and white horrors ).If anyone can help me out it would be appreciated.I will pay money and costs of shipping or exchange for some items from Australia ie White pointers (Shark) tooth pendant.On vhs tape can be either ntsc or pal recordings.Just remember you can never replace the memories or scared feelings that these old hammer horrors gave us when we were young and impressionable.I gave this a 10 rating cos it was the first horror film i saw and the fond memories of how scared i was are still with me to this day 30 years later.
