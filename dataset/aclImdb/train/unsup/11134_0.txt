i only really watched this film because i was on holiday in boring Yorkshire with nothing to do what so ever. also it had Lindsay Lohan in, one of my top favourite actresses so i thought what the hell. i was pleasantly surprised though as i really enjoyed the film. at first i thought OK a doll comes to life how gay. in fact it was really cool and Lindsay played a totally lovable character. the actress that played the doll was really good too and her and Lindsay worked well together to produce an excellent film. i didn't really like the end though as i thought it would have been much better if she hadn't gone back to Sunnyvale but had stayed and married Casey's dad. that would have been much cuter. i'd recommend anyone to watch this film, i think the family would enjoy it- well maybe not the dads!
