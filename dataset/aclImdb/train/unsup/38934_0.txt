What can I say. Silly plot, bad acting with teens that look closer to mid twenties or maybe thirty. Boy friends who start up sex on a moments notice and look way to pumped up.<br /><br />A absolutely absurd plot that contains some paranormal elements and a real world slayer, or mad butcher who could never be believed.<br /><br />I only ask, who watches and pays for this trash? The Mom of the main heroin acted as if she needed to be in a padded cell.<br /><br />I am amazed by the absolute trash that gets produced and eventually ends up on DVD for unsuspecting viewers to laugh at.<br /><br />The mad slasher part could have been done away with and perhaps given this very bad flick a better rating by moderately intelligent viewers.
