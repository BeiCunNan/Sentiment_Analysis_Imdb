I personally feel that firstly, Stacy and Clinton are way too harsh. No one deserves to be spoken to in such a demeaning and hurtful way. The point could be made with a bit more kindness. Frankly, while I would not condone it, I am surprised that there haven't been punches thrown in the direction of the hosts. Now for those clothing choices. Mostly bad. I would never want a tight little jacket that uncomfortably snug. Looks like one can't raise her arms. Slacks nearly dragging the ground is so ugly, and most of us who's upper arms have gotten a little bigger, don't want to wear sleeveless or cap-sleeves, but rather kind of loose and to the elbow at least. One more thing, most women do not spend $200 on a blouse or pants. How much better to shop with all that credit card at a more reasonable priced department store. NO, I don't mean Wal-Mart. A $50 pair of jeans can fit and look really good. A good choice would be Marshall's or TJ Maxx. So calm down a little with the harsh remarks. Shop a little more wisely. I am 4ft. 11in. and I get frightened when I think of what those two would put me in. No way I would let them near me.<br /><br />Thanks, Peace to all
