The story of a woman grieving over the loss of her husband and son, seems like a story that should not be told, it felt like every scene was just watching her crying and having flashbacks. On the other hand, scenes were very well done, and clear at some points, very good special effects too. I have to say though, this is by far the worst movie I have seen, or at least, I can recall seeing. The whole story looks like repetition, and then the mystery to be revealed of how everything happened is very badly done, it is easily guessed, not in any way clever, and pointless. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, it is appalling.
