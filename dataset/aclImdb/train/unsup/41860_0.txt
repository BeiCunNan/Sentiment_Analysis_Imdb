Where to start? Appalling dialogue which is barely audible, 'acting' on a par with a junior school Nativity play, no budget, bad lighting, shocking editing... the list of faults is endless.<br /><br />The story, of which there is precious little, concerns a group of 6 friends on a journey to Norwich, who's car runs out of petrol in the middle of nowhere and are offered shelter for the night in a country mansion house. And that's pretty much it.<br /><br />Throw into this heady mix a bit of Devil Worshipping and the obligatory retarded cook/manservant come dogsbody and the slutty maid, and you have a perfectly good idea as to why the British film industry is in such a bad way these days.<br /><br />80% of the, thankfully short, running time is made up of badly choreographed sex scenes, which begs the question was this made as a short intentionally, or is there a longer hardcore version floating around that was made for international distribution, as at the time, here in the UK, there were almost Draconian laws governing what could and couldn't be shown on screen in an adult movie. Looking at the way the majority of the cuts appear on screen this would seem the case, though on the other hand it could just be a bad movie. Directed by the guy who we all now know as Ben Dover and starring his girlfriend, former Penthouse Pet Linzi Drew, this also makes you think there's more been filmed than the running time listed offers. The remainder of the running time consists of some badly lit Satanic Ritual that could have been quite effective, but like the rest of the film is just poorly executed. While sex movies were all simulated here, home video was wholly unregulated, which in later years would bring up the furore over the so called 'Video Nasties' and the introduction of the Video Recordings Act, so as this movie was made in 1981, a little imagination and a little more money could have made an effective adult chiller.<br /><br />As a horror film it fails miserably, basically because there is none. Again as a sex film, considering what was going on in the rest of Europe and the USA at the time, it's light years behind the times, but again, that can only be attributed to the laws of the land at the time, but on an exploitative level it very nearly works, it's just the right side of sleazy and cheesy to make it worth trying to track a copy down, if for no other reason than to pick fault with the way certain pieces of music have been put to bad use.<br /><br />As the credits finish we are treated to a final screen that flashes up 'COMING SOON - DEATH SHOCK II'. Fortunately, 20 odd years later, we're still waiting.
