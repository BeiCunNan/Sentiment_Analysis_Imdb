This is a movie I can never get tired of. You can watch it again and again, all day long. It's laid-back and entertaining, and doesn't ask much or expect much of you, the viewer. The story involves a thirty-something lifeguard who is naturally slick with the ladies, on and off the beach, and oh, saves lives too. Sam Elliot is a very cool actor and delivers otherwise simple lines with slow-burn perfection. Parker Stevenson is his young protégé who is in the film JUST enough, Anne Archer his perfect lady, and Kathleen Quinlin is a young girl, supposedly a teenager, who represents the last of Elliot's 'conquests' before settling down with Anne, who is his age. There is a part in the middle of the film that centers on Elliot's character feeling old and, after attending a 15 year high school reunion, trying to get a job selling cars. This is when he starts dating Archer, realizing she is someone he can settle down with and NOT just for 'fun'. In most films this part of the film would hinder the otherwise kickback feel, but in this movie's case, it flows along just as good as the beach scenes. It's a relaxing movie and you can play it on a loop on your DVD machine (now that it's finally on DVD) and I bet you won't get tired of it. If you do, just swim to shore a while... and I'm sure, soon enough, you'll want to see it again... and again... and again... LIFEGUARD!
