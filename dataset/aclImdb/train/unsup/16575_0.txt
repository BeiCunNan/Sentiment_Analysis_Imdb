Good movie about gracious southern life mixed with a lot of behavior that is anything but gracious. The movie couldn't seem to decide between being a drama and a comedy, but is nevertheless more than worth watching because of the character played by Kyra Sedgwick. She has at least 2 or 3 of the greatest lines ever uttered in the movies that will make you absolutely fall out with laughter (unless they offend your delicate sensibilities too much). I loved this movie. It shouldn't be taken as seriously as some seem to want to take it. The title indicates to me that they were really aiming at comedy here, and it some places, they really, really hit it.
