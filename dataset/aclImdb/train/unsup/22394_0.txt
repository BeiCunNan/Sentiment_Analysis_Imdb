The best way to sum up My Super Sweet 16 is this. A bunch of spoiled rotten girls from rich families are given insanely huge and expensive birthday parties for their 16th birthday parties. 9 out of 10 times usually end with the girls whining or complaining about some minor detail and otherwise acting like total bitches.<br /><br />This show is in a long line of shows from MTV and VH1 that truly shows just how horrible reality series are. Even if The Real World is a terrible series, at least it's more entertaining than this trash of slutty girls and their parties. <br /><br />Do a favor to yourself and don't watch this series. If you do, go to a hypnotist to forget about it.
