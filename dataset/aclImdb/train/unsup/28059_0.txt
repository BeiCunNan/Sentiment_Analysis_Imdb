But when it comes to the review of this movie, it's all good news. James Wood is Lloyd Hopkins, the jaded cop who throws himself into one particular case after his wife, Penny, leaves him. Adapted from a James Elroy novel, this crime drama turns out pretty good. And while not reaching the heights of L.A. Confidential in some ways, for me it come close and exceeded that great movie in other ways thanks to an understated acting chops of James Woods. That guy remains a criminally under-rated actor. In my mind, he's one of the greats. Plus the ending is so VERY good.<br /><br />My Grade:A<br /><br />Where I Saw it: Starz Action
