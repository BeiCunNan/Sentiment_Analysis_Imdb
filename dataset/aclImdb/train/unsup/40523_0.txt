watched this at work to pass some time on a slow night shift. oh my god! its absolute poop. it is very slow indeed (described as art-house by some reviewers) but some of the scenes are so slow we were laughing at them, its like someones forgot there's film in the camera. the rewind bit just doesn't sit with the rest of the film, its just total garbage. all in all i wish a x x o and f x g would watch some of the films there palming off onto the unsuspecting download public.Naomi watts looks good though! see ended on a positive. we watched zohan the night before and that was loads better. one more line needed. one more line needed. one more line needed.
