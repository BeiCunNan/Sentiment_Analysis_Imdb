As a NYer who grew up watching adult films from the Big '80s, "Raw Talent" was the seminal film for that decade. With a better than average storyline, Jerry Butler (Bklyn's own) was able to shine. He WAS the James Dean of porn! Graced with chiseled features and natural comedic ability, his performances were always unpredictable and wacky. The accompanying soundtrack was also above par. The subliminal psychadelia scene was straight out of Floyd & Zeppelin. Unfortunately, "Raw Talent" was re-released with major Politically Correct edits. The masturbatory cooked turkey scene, the forced sex scene over a toilet bowl, and all the karate scenes are nowhere to be found. Luckily, I managed to retain a copy during the height of my rental days! ehe If anyone is interested in seeing the uncut, original film, drop me a line.
