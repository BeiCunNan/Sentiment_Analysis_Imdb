I caught this movie on Lifetime, but it had the Hallmark network feel to it. Sometimes this type of film can be overly sentimental, but I found this one to be wonderful as it emphasized the importance of taking time to love one another. Maureen O'Hara, at 80-something and looking great, plays a schoolteacher who becomes involved in the life of a former student and his wife. As a woman whose great love ended before the relationship could fully develop, she imparts what she has learned to them about what's really important in this world, and what really stays with those we leave behind when we go into the next one.<br /><br />O'Hara is really inspirational. Her voice and acting are strong and her no-nonsense portrayal keeps "The Last Dance" from being cloying in any way. You really grow to love this woman and all she stands for. The flashback scenes are well cast.<br /><br />A nice movie to catch, especially around the holidays.
