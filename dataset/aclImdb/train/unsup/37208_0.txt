The way a man's life is played around with on screen is just stupid, this poorly made fabrication of what Kevin did and did not do was not approved by Kevin, and anyone with a familarity with hacking knows that this is a movie that you should avoid. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, GO RENT WARGAMES. It's fiction but it's still more factual than this waste of film.
