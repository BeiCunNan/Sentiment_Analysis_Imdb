An underwater sea park is attacked by a great white with a bite radius of nearly a yard. When it attacks a underwater tunnel, with many civilians trapped inside, it's up to Dennis Quaid and crew to weld a plate in place of the breach . Simon MacCorkindale portrays a Brit photographer who likes the media spotlight, but courageously offers to be "live bait"(..and is in the film's best sequence as the shark chows down on him with the camera recording this inside the mouth, really a remarkable effect)as a distraction for Quaid to complete the welding task without harm. Bess Armstrong is Quaid's lady love who decides to go down and watch his back just in case the shark swims toward them. Louis Gossett Jr. is the head honcho of the theme park who watches in horror as his dream goes up in smoke thanks to the shark's desire to feed.<br /><br />The 3D effects just aren't very good..they might've worked in 1983 on the big screen, but just make the viewing experience now a burden. The 3D effects look like just that..separate from everything else. What hurts even more is that nothing really happens for nearly 1 hour and a half until the shark makes it's attack on people in the water(mainly Lea Thompson, the love interest of Dennis Quaid's brother John Putch). The shark effects range from good to awful..especially rotten is the scene where the shark breaks through the glass housing the control room with Gossett Jr and company. The cast, except Bess, are merely going through the motions and it's quite easy to see that the franchise was about finished off..JAWS:THE REVENGE would be the death nail on the coffin of the Jaws franchise.
