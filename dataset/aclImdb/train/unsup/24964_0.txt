The cartoon begins with Tom in the middle of a VERY bad game of golf. Already about 86 over par he, for some reason, uses Jerry as a Tee. Not taking kindly to this Jerry turns the table and plays tricks on Tom. And that's pretty much it for the rest of the cartoon. This one has quite a thin premise but gets enough mileage out of it I guess. The visual jokes are all rather amusing but I do feel sorry for Tom when he's victimized in such a way. Whether it's being stung by a hoard of bees or having his teeth smashed out by a rogue ball, Tom seems to get more than his usual share of pain in Tee for Two. Does that make me a bad person for thinking that it's funny?
