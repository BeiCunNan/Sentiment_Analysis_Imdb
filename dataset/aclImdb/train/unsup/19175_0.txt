Standing on the Pinnacle of Giants<br /><br />A secret domain of poets deceased, enlightens the men whose numbers increased. Assembled in class, they march with a stride, undaunted and strong with Keating aside. Passions intense, his lectures draw ears, like sheep of a flock, the Shepard of hearers.

Unfortunate loss to teacher of choice, remember his words to raise your own voice. Now but a legend his message relays, be your own person and still "Seize the day!"
