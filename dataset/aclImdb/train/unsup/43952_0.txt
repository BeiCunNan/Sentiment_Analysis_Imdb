Utterly absurd thriller, though original in some ways. From the beginning I knew that the cop and/or the shrink were in some way hiding something and I was right. It turned out to be a pretty shaky motive for hiding the identity of the killer. And how about the killer's daughter going on a bit of a rampage herself Â– and that first murder (manslaughter) of hers! Oh, sorry, I just shoved you a bit and now you're dead! Well, that's a bit of jolly bad luck, old sport, ey? I've seen dumber thriller, far dumber actually, so this one doesn't even rate as being THAT silly on a silliness scale for thrillers. Still, the film isn't dull, although a bit slow here and there.
