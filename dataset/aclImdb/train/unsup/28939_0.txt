It's got everything, including length! It's full of actors who later became famous for other roles. It's more or less accurate historically. It takes its time to develop the story with countless dirty, amusing, moving details. I just love it and can't imagine why few people seem to have even heard of it. I suppose it's a guy film.<br /><br />An overriding theme depicted in many wonderful ways is the transition of "authentic" heroes of the sort exemplified by Yaeger and other unsung test pilots, to "astronauts" -- creatures of the media, no braver than other pilots (although just as highly skilled) but marketed as such for the pleasure of politicians and the bureaucracy of NASA in the race for space. These astronauts cooperate with this mischaracterization since it fits well their monumental egos, but the director makes clear in myriad,nuanced ways (like during the fan dance in the Astrodome) that deep inside they know they are shams in comparison to those slogging away at Edwards without media attention and unearned perks.
