In my life, i have seen a lot of bad movies, and out of those, about three handfuls of movies i never managed to finish. And "When Do We Eat?" is one of the movies i never was arsed to finish.<br /><br />To be straight out honest, this movie is crap. I watched as much of this movie as I could (which was about two thirds of the movie), and during that dreadful hour, I laughed once. For a movie that is supposed to have "about a joke every minute, and sometimes too many jokes for one to swallow", that's not a really good thing. The jokes aren't really good, makes very little sense, and is about as funny to me as it would be pulling my toe nails out.<br /><br />The plot, which I must say didn't seem so bad, actually turned in to a big pile of junk without sense after a while. The whole "crazy family holiday gone wrong thing" is, fair enough, overused, but the dinner part is new. Unfortunately, it isn't presented in a way which I enjoyed. It's messy, it's crappy, and it's boring. From the moment the dad in this movie found out he was drugged and until I turned it off, i was bored. I thought that was gonna be the funnier part of the movie, but it wasn't. I really can't come close to explain how bored I was. Go watch it yourself if you do not believe me.
