I'm not one of those persons who believe novels should be adapted to the screen faithfully, word for word.Changes have to be made,we're talking of two different mediums of telling a story.But changes apart, the storyline must remain the same;the characters remain the same,the solution to the crime must be the one devised by the novel's author. That just doesn't happens here. Stephen Churchett decided to be original and destroyed one of the best novels AC ever wrote!!!!To turn the three sisters of the novel into nuns?!!!!!!!!!!!!What the hell was he thinking of?!!!!To make Jason Rafiel a German emigrant and his son a German soldier?!!!!Will somebody please tell me what this changes add to the original story?Please?And I'm just touching the surface here;there was much,much more to be said about this piece of trash TV,but I won't even bother.AC must be turning in her grave,seeing what they're doing to her work,I promise you!If you can get your hands on the Joan Hickson's version of Nemesis,do yourself a favor and watch it instead. This one is a total waste of time! Just one more thing:Joan Hickson is THE definite Marple.She was absolutely perfect in the part,in the same way that David Suchet is perfect as Poirot.That said,I must point out that I actually enjoy Geraldine McEwan as Marple;she's not my favorite,she's not perfect,but she's a wonderful actress and thoroughly enjoyable to watch as the old spinster from St Mary Mead - and her performance is the only reason I'm giving this disaster area 3 stars,and not the 0 it deserves.
