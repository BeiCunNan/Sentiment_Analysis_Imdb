AWFUL!!!! <br /><br />Were they trying to save time and film? <br /><br />There needs to be MANY more steps between where the characters started and where they ended. Where is the struggle and inner-conflict? They just get the chance to do something completely UNCHARACTERISTIC and with only one hesitation they lurch at it. It's like they're desperate for a change.<br /><br />Where is the impetus for this? Surely they have had plenty of opportunities for experimentation before now. This would only be believable if it had been established that they had been lived their entire lives (through high-school, college, & medical school) completely isolated from society. Haven't they EVER had to deal with temptation? They act as if they got married in high school and have been living sheltered lives ever since, clinging desperately to their marriage and spurning all advances. I don't remember if they stated how long they had been together, but SURELY they've had other relationships and other temptations. The other possibility about how this could happen so easily is that it ISN'T uncharacteristic but is common. But if they are promiscuous that undermines the whole script.<br /><br />AWFUL!!! With more development the characters might have reached the same situations. They might have been able to change that much, but these are clearly two people who have spent years intentionally making themselves inflexible (as his mother said). They could have rebelled (even secretly) before now. They must be about 26 years old. I can't believe that they have been repressed for that whole time and yet well adjusted enough to build a relationship together. They don't seem sexually repressed with each other (even if it isn't as great as it has been, they obviously are very sexual). I just don't buy it!!!
