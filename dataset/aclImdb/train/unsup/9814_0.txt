I was watching this movie and had to look up why it is totally false.<br /><br />The author answered it on his web site - "It was that month that I began writing "Loose Change," a fictional story about my friends and I discovering that September 11th was not a terrorist attack, but rather, an attack by their own government." Seems they went along and just kept increasing the fiction level. If love fiction, you will love Loose Change.<br /><br />If you want truth avoid this movie! If you use the internet to find information, you will have to sort out the 98 percent junk you find before you can find rational thought on 9/11, yet you will find all this movie's information for free.<br /><br />This is the movie, if you like conspiracy and do not want facts and real evidence to clutter your thoughts or help you make conclusions. This is the movie to satisfy the most discerning tin foil hat viewer there is, or ever will be. Relax and let someone else do your thinking.<br /><br />You know when your parents told you not to trust anyone? These are the guys they were talking about.
