This is a very interesting film. I honestly felt I was bored through a large portion of this movie but I could not stop watching. I was wrong I was not bored I was fascinated and intrigued a feeling very rare in the world of modern film watching. So rare I did not recognize the feeling until well into he film. This is truly gripping and ultimately tragic horror film. HIGHLY recommended.
