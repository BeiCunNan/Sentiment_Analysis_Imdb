The best movie i have ever seen in my entire life.<br /><br />The actors, characters, cinematography, storyline are as good as it gets for this particular genre.<br /><br />Truly inspirational.While most families around the world worries or complain about not having the best of everything, and their lack of appreciation to the simplest, or basic essentials in life, this movie will show how lucky you really are.<br /><br />I've read some comments that down played the integrity of this movie, and in for obvious reasons, these comments came from people who's never been to the Philippines, who's never experienced poverty, and a complete slave to the "Hollywood" stereotypical way of depicting drama in the movies. The portrayal of the day to day hardships of this Philippine family in this movie is as real as it gets, or worse to some. <br /><br />If this movie didn't touch you, then look for meetings that can help you.
