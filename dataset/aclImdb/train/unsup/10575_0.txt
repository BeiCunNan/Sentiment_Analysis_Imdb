With such a cool-looking DVD jacket, 2 well-known actors (Vinnie Jones and Sean Astin), and a cool premise (time travel and a bank robbery), I expected something similar to Nick Cage's "Next", but different.<br /><br />Instead, we get a film that thinks it is like the "Matrix" with rotating camera slow-mo gun battles (where nobody takes cover), unbelievable dialog and bad casting (the male FBI partner looked like he just came from a soap commercial, and Sean Astin cannot cut it as a "genius" scientist).<br /><br />The only one who saves face is Vinnie Jones, because, after all, he's Vinnie Jones and lends his natural ferocity to any role he's agreed to take on, including this crap.<br /><br />The worst part about this film, however, was that it was confusing and badly written. First, Sean Astin spends about 10 minutes of the film trying to hit on the female bank teller. His lines are so creepy, but his face and manner seems so normal, it is not convincing. The first 10 minutes and I already was disgusted by the hero, who kept using his time-travel device to go back 10 minutes and, (like Bill Murray in "Groundhog Day") think of better lines to pick her up. But the pick-up lines go from bad to worse: "You are like a peach. So ripe. I want to just eat you," to, " All I can think of is how you look in black lace panties". Some genius. Supposed to be funny, but it's not. This icky courtship by the wunderkind is just repellent to watch, and already in the first 10 minutes, I hated the main character (Astin)! The female FBI agent gets hold of Astin's time machine device (which looks like a hand-held clear plastic cellphone/compass), realizes its power, and then..even though she knows there's going to be a takeover bank robbery in seconds, proceeds to... arrest Sean Astin?? And why 2 FBI agents would stand up in a bank and start firing their pistols at 4 body-armored, machine-gun wielding robbers, endangering everyone else in the bank unnecessarily is beyond me. But they do, and the film makes this already unbelievable sequence last for about 15 minutes with Matrix-like rotating-camera effects which make the heads appear more like video game AI avatars that fire at you in slow-mo, nobody getting hit the whole time. It's surreal and stupid. The lead robber makes a getaway (purloining the device), and leaves his friends in the bank--NO--they're already in the van, OK. So they drive away with the loot (or without? who cares!!) and end up crashing the van even though they are not being chased! They survive a tumbling crash without a single broken bone, even though they weren't wearing their seat belts. They get out, and instead of carjacking someone, they decide to...hijack a busload of people until the authorities arrive! Meanwhile the van blows up, of course.<br /><br />This movie makes Cage's "Next" look like Oscar material. <br /><br />Avoid this turkey. 2 points.
