If Mario Lopez wants to put the thought into peoples mind that he "might" be gay then he would have been better off not wearing that body stocking during the very strained love scene in this disaster of a movie. Thank god this is one of those movies that you have to stumble across while channel surfing late at night (and hopefully drunk). I don't understand why they didn't have a gay rape scene in it since it is obvious that these young astronauts (or whatever they are suppose to be) have no interest in women. The one who initiates the cigarette burning should have been the one who gets to successfully rape Mario. Hey, in my opinion that would have given it better appeal to the targeted audience (the gay community).
