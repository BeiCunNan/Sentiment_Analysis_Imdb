SPOIL ALERT! Big Wednesday is perhaps the most underrated film of all time-- it is simply an unbelievable film. It is a film that depends on each scene, each character and each line spoken to make the story work. I have never seen a film with such a great cast of characters and such a feeling of change. If this film were to be summarized briefly it would be rendered a film that showcases the effects of change. The beginning era in 1962 shows the era of innocence, partying, sex, and the era of Bear. In the early scenes, Bear is looked up to by all the surfers as a God... a man who knows all. Perhaps the greatest two scenes in the beginning come when Bear is making the "Big Wave board" and speaking of the day when "a swell so big will wipe everything that came before it". Of course, the board is ridden during the famous Big Wednesday of 1974, just as Bear had predicted. The other great scene is the party scene. Amongst my friends and myself, we now refer to awesome parties as "Big Wednesday parties", but of course none of them can compare. The second era shows Matt as the drunk, and Jack as the straight-laced lifeguard. Bear is prosperous as ever, running his huge store despite earlier being upset at "living like an inlander". A key scene comes when Matt the drunk goes to Bear for advice, and Bear again proves his wisdom. A major element of change can be seen when in 1974 it is Bear who is the drunk and Matt is attempting to give him advice. Perhaps the one line that Bear says which shows his major change is "I'm just a garbage man!" after being queried about his surfing. While everything changes, the only thing that remains constant is Matt, Leroy and Jack's intense friendship. I could go on forever, but I'd rather leave it to others to watch despite my spoils. This film will make you embrace youth and friendship like no other picture could ever do. 10/10
