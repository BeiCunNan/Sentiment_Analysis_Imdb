There had been many,many stories about The Loch Ness Monster; but there is one of they think is HOW the monster came to be, along with that famous photo. In this wonderful film, based on a book by the same author of Babe; I have read the book AND seen the film. The story is about a lonely little boy named Angus who discovers a mysterious rock on the beach. But it was really an egg that hatches a sea creature known as a "Water Horse." So Angus kept the creature as a secret pet and named it Crusoe, and only his sister Kirstie and a Mr. Mowbray know about him.<br /><br />I love the scene with baby Crusoe and the toy dog, that was too cute and funny. And I just love the gorgeous Scottish scenery, and the great old house...very palatial wouldn't you say. All I could about this film is that it has charm, humor and sure to warm the hearts of kids AND adults alike.
