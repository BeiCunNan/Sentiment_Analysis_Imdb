The year after his sensational smash "Gremlins", Joe Dante brought us yet another fantasy about creatures unknown, and this time, places unseen as well.<br /><br />"Explorers" is the tale of three young boys who follow a dream they all share which takes them into deep outer space where they meet beings beyond their wildest imaginations. Dante's film unfortunately has nothing for the adult audience that was so delighted and entertained by the two "Gremlins" films however. This is simply an adventure for the kids, and one the younger ones will probably enjoy.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke ("Dead Poets Society") and River Phoenix ("Stand By Me") star, and they have fun in a special effects show which features a good score from Jerry Goldsmith. Fair to mediocre entertainment which lacks too much depth and humour to satisfy an older crowd.<br /><br />Monday, January 3, 1994 - Video
