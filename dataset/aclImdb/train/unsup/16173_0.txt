Just watched Ironbound Vampire, in my continuing search for the absolute worst movie, and this is a contender. I would be less harsh if I knew that it was somebody's class project, with relatives and friends participating; i. e., not professionals but amateurs. The story: a soldier's WWI wounds are a feast for a vampire, which causes the military man to become an undead. Thereafter, the recruit settles in the Ironbound section of Newark, NJ, and is responsible for many of that area's unsolved murders and missing persons since then. Among the characters to whom we are introduced during the film are a detective, who writes a book about these events; and a doctor, who helps capture the never-aging bloodsucker. Gore is almost nil. Make-up is Halloweenish. Effects are not special. Watch this flick only to realize that anybody with a camera could do just as well - probably better.
