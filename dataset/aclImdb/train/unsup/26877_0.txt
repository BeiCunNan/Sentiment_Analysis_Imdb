Say what you like about a good independent movie or a good b-movie but to me, a good film like ACNE, beats a decent $80 million dollar film every time. Yes, the acting isn't as professional with this film, but that adds a certain realism. Yes, the sets aren't always picture perfect but whose house or office is? ACNE is a horror movie for 2005 and beyond. The threats to the main characters are as real as what people face everyday around our planet. Pollution, exploitation, manipulation, false promises, disease and disfigurement but it does so with a twisted black comic heart and believe me, you're going to laugh (with the movie).
