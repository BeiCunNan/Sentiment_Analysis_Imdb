All i can say is give it 11 out of 10! Its got so much gore and alien homeworlds and broadswords, and yet im sure if you took your wife/girlfriend or religious father to see it they would nod and smile at the end and say 'i didn't think id enjoy that''but it was quite good actually'<br /><br />I haven't felt so excited watching a film in years! especially not an action/fantasy film. The alien was SWEET and truly magnificent, the cgi was top notch. The director needs a big pat on the back.<br /><br />I haven't felt this way since i was a kid, it emulated all my favourite childhood films ALIEN, HIGHLANDER, PREDATOR....with a touch of WILLOW<br /><br />So SO good! im gonna see it again!<br /><br />LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE
