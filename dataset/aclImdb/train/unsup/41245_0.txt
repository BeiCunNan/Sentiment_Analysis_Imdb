Well the movie is full of bad words. Makes sense if you are using those words yourselves very often. I didn't like it for the fact that you cannot watch it with family. I give the movie 2 of 10. Well talking about the actors. They have done a decent job. Not special to write someone about it. The background score is also very dull. No suspense at all. Script is also very dull. Looks like the script has been written by someone who is very new in the field. Overall a boring movie. Since the start the movie is very slow paced. It does gather some pace in the middle but fades off during the end. Had the script been modified and some good songs or some interesting people been added, the movie could have been much better to watch.
