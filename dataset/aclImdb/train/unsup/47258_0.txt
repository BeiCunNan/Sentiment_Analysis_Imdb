This may be a very mild spoiler but yes, this film actually had a script. Even more shocking; it actually had writers. I was originally assuming that someone had watched the Mighty Ducks, and switched hockey for basketball, Emilio Estavez for Martin Lawrence, and genuine entertainment for a farce of a movie. Lawrence can at least half-act, he proved that in Bad Boys. So he has no excuses for this. This brought out every tired clich√© in the book and then slowly murdered them one by one. They even had the one training session scene in which everyone remarkably improves, which I thought had been retired forever. Even the obvious love interest was stupidly achieved and pointless. I don't mind a film being a little predictable, but I don't like one in which I can guess at least one in every two lines. This film was purely and simply shocking.
