I decided to rent the movie based on the fact that IMDb's ratings for the movie was 7.1 out of ten and also on the fact that Nick Nolte also appears in the film.<br /><br />The movie is basically about a washed up band member: Emily who is a heroin addict and the child she has abandoned who lives with her boyfriends parents.<br /><br />Nick Nolte plays the boy's guardian. After her boyfriend overdoses on heroin Emily spends the rest of the movie trying to get "clean" so she can try to reunite with her young son.<br /><br />The movie moves aimlessly between scenes of Emily trying to reconnect to her son's life in the states and her more recent life and struggle with addiction and past relationships in Paris. I found the movie to be tedious and drawn out.In the end the movie leaves the audience feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. To me, it was a complete waste of time.<br /><br />Felix!
