What was the point of this movie? To annoy? To inspire? To confuse? to make people stupid? Why did she get into a play, then go to a concert with a friend and meet her idol, then come back and star in the play after some girl told her she wasn't at the after party but she knew she was and so did her friend and then a guy who she had spoken to about twice asked her out or something like that? WHAT???!!! Lindsay Lohan really knows how to confuse and annoy. And what was with her friend following her around all the time crying and saying " oh i can't lie to my parents", but then doing it anyway and being so happy when she got grounded? I understand that I watched this movie my friends and i were very tired, but my god were we all so confused at what the point of it all was.<br /><br />I really don't understand what this movie was trying to say but i know what it said to me: "you have finally gone insane".
