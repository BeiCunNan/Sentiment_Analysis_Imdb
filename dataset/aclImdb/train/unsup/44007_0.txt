Why? The main character goes around in blacface and emits horrible sounds from his mouth that some people claim is singing.No matter how many persons are in Jolson's corner they can't convince anyone with a normal sense of hearing that he's some kind of singer(?).For anyone that thinks it's o.k. for a white man to sing mammy in black face go down to a black neighborhood and tell the people that.As a non-black that lived in black districts I can tell you it upsets them.When this movie came out on TV in the 1960's it made me cringe because I knew a lot of people around me were going to be upset.Yes,the good old 1960's when the riots started,showing a movie like this didn't help prevent them.The people that support and broadcast-ed this movie go around oblivious to realty.While their safe in a sheltered world during the riots I'm on the funky streets trying to be on time for the graveyard shift.Some persons now believe Leif Erickson discovered America instead Of Columbus.A change is needed in movie history too.In the best interest of a happier society I'd like for this movie not to be given any claim to fame,sweep it under the rug.May a technicality give the fame to a more decent film.
