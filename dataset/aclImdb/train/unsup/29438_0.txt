I was expecting a good story, good character development, excellent acting from Jolie & Banderas, and some great erotic scenes.<br /><br />What I got was a very implausible story that zigzags from love to murderous revenge and back again, no backstory, unsympathetic characters with erratic behavior, and a weird sadistic bisexual boyfriend/pimp (Thomas Jane's character). The sex scenes seemed passionless and were barely erotic. The acting by Banderas and Jolie was good, as were the sets, locations, and lighting, but it didn't rescue the film.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this movie.
