The Edukators artfully combines the archetypal love triangle storyline with political discussion and your typical heist gone awry flick and a journey of self-discovery. On the one hand, it's fairly ambitious genre-crossing, on the other the political aspects of it (although relevant) feel outdated. Jan is like most Che Guevarra-loving undergraduate Marxists I know, and I agree completely with the frustrating lack of a cohesive politicized youth movement (in the US)to provide an outlet for angst, and dissent from the current regime, etc. but the manifesto of the Edukators isn't particularly compelling. It merely provides a set up for the clash between generations, and the realization that we do share something in common with our parents. Also it frames the love triangle, and emphasizes the fragility of human relationships. On a side note, I hated the grainy-ness of the film...weirdly I actually watched a film print of the DV transfer, so it might look better on a Digital Projector, & I also had the experience of watching the film burn through, which rarely happens now. DV sucks, especially for a movie that's based so much in the mountains and in nature, its a shame it couldn't be better captured.
