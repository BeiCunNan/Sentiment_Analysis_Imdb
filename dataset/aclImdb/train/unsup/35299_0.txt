My five year old did not enjoy this movie because Pooh and friends spend most of the movie scared and in perceived peril. Much of the movie looks like they are walking through the Mines of Moria. Everyone is scared, everyone is nervous and it translates right to the kids watching. The gang just goes from one bad situation to another. What is the point? At the end of the movie (which does end sweetly) my daughter exclaimed, "I never want to see that movie again!" As for the DVD extras, I've never been a fan of how Disney handles the heffalumps. Every heffalump sequence seems like an acid trip. The DVD includes an older episode featuring morphing heffalumps. It was just more disturbing stuff that my kid didn't enjoy.
