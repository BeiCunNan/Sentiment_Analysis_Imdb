BEETHOVEN'S 2ND, in my opinion, is even cuter than the first BEETHOVEN. I laughed really hard when George (Charles Grodin) first discovered the puppies in the basement of his house and said, "Oh, no!" Those puppies were absolutely adorable! In my opinion, Regina (Debi Mazar) and Floyd (Chris Penn) were like Cruella and her henchmen, Horace and Jasper! I was so glad when the puppies got them all dirty. I mean, what human being would want to drown five sweet, cute, innocent puppies? When Beethoven caused the deck of Taylor's (Ashley Hamilton) lake house to collapse, I was relieved. This was because he saved Ryce (Nicholle Tom) from being raped. In conclusion, I highly recommend this cute movie to all you dog lovers or Charles Grodin fans who have not seen it.
