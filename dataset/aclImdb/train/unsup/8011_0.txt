I bought this garbage for only $3 in the used DVD bargain bin, and I still feel ripped off and cheated - out of money and time.<br /><br />I am not a bore, and I do appreciate intelligent art films and such. This however is a quiet, go-nowhere, predictable, pretentious film that should never have been made. I am disturbed to think that the filmmakers are out there somewhere congratulating themselves on this garbage. I'm sure fans will think they are very smart for sitting through this mind-numbing catastrophe.<br /><br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.<br /><br />Synopsis: Quirky girl stuck in fridge, gets out, notices no one loves her, develops affinity for all things cold and men on boats, pursues ice. The End.<br /><br />There, I just saved you from wasting your time watching "L' Iceberg." You're welcome.
