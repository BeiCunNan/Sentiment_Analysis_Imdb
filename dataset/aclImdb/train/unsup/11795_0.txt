I vacillated between giving "Better Than Sex" a 6 or 7 star rating for quite some time, but in the end it really is a better film than just "a little" above average. The movie - a study and portrayal of two people engaging in sex with a "light-hearted" attitude is compelling, realistic, entertaining, and completely delightful.<br /><br />I know I'm not supposed to refer to another voter's comments, but I totally agree with someone who wrote that they saw this film again immediately after their first viewing. It really is that watchable.<br /><br />Shot in Australia, its unpretentious and unassuming treatment of sexual obsession is light years away from other (particularly American) films with a similar theme , such as "9 ½ weeks". There's no gloss or "spit and shine" polish here. No Kim-Bassinger- siren nor Mickey Rourke bravado with sweat dripping off the main characters as though they were screwing for the Olympics. There are just two horny buggers  normal people going through the motions of God's gift to the living, (coupled with emotional entanglement).<br /><br />And hey, what could be better than that?
