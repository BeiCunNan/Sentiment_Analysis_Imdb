A leopard was to be used in an act, until it ran away and panic began in this helpless village. Such is the plot in this Val Lewton production. As usual, Lewton and director Tournier know what they are doing and are able to scare the pants off the viewer with violence that is implied and is never actually seen. The fact that the leopard's victims are women and that we see them running and afraid fuel our increasing anxieties. While it doesn't have the mood of "I Walked with a Zombie", it is in contrast a straightforward story of an animal/enemy that needs to be caught and/or destroyed for the safety of the community. But, there is a twist. The killings don't look like an animal did it.<br /><br />Starring Dennis O'Keefe, who was a prolific B-movie actor in the 30s and 40s, and Margo, who was in real life married to actor Eddie Albert of "Green Acres" fame and mother of Edward Albert of "Butterflies Are Free", this is another Val Lewton must-see horror film. Its climax and denouement are somewhat disappointing (but that's up to you) and it's to the taste of the viewer whether you like this or "Zombie" better, but, all in all, it's vastly superior to the gore you see today. No one could do it like Lewton.
