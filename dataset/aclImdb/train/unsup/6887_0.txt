As someone who always likes to solve the New York Times crossword - I like crossword puzzles in general, but the NYT one is the most challenging - "Wordplay" was a real treat for me. I have to admit that I'm no match for the people involved in the tournament, but it's still great to see this all. Will Shortz has got to be one of the cleverest people alive. I was most surprised when Merl Reagle wrote in the answers to the theme and found words to fill in (I had always thought that impossible).<br /><br />Moreover, it's neat to see Bill Clinton and Jon Stewart doing the crossword (I assume that George W. Bush never does crosswords). A really impressive documentary.
