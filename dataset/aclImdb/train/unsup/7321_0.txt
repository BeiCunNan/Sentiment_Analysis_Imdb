Well. I am south Korean, now I am staying in Sweden. I watched this film with some native Swedish students and other exchange students from Western part. <br /><br />Actually I was wondering that why this Korean director is so that famous especially in western countries than South Korea. It doesn't mean that this director and his films are unnamed in South Korea. He is famous as a kind of art film director, and his films are also not that failed but still his name is popular but his films are not that much, I think. <br /><br />I think the reason why he is so that famous in western part of the world is that in a rough way he uses the oriental-ism.
