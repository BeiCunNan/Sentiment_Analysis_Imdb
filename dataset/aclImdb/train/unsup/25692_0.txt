A biker-outfitted clad, hearse driving killer searches for the construction workers (and those associated with them) who gang-raped a girl earlier in the film. The vigilante's weapon of choice is, in keeping with the name of the movie, a nail gun. She (or he) also spouts some truly awful one-liners as he (she) offs the victims. Also an inept cop and inane doctor are searching for the murderer/revenge killer. That's pretty much it story-wise.<br /><br />Man oh man is this a bad BAD movie. Atrocious acting, dreadfully unfunny quips from the killer (whose voice is synthesized to keep the supposed 'mystery' of who it is), a script my dog could write, el cheapo gore 'special effects'. This is strictly amateur hour in every single connotation of the word.For something similar, yet a billion times better, do yourself a favor and rent "the Toolbox Murders" instead (the original NOT the remake) <br /><br />Eye Candy: Staci Gordon & Kit Mitchell get topless (Kit is also topless in the DVD outtakes); Shelly York shows tits & a bit of bush (word of caution: John Rudder shows his ass and penis) <br /><br />My Grade: D- <br /><br />Synapse DVD Extras: A 25 minute interview with Director Terry Loften; an 8 & a half minute outtake reel (with no film audio but with comments from the director) ; & Promotional trailer for this film
