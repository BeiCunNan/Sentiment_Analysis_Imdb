Yes, I own this but at least I didn't pay much, 'cause it was used. Anyway, this film is boring, Oliver's accent is annoying and he puts on that " I don't want to fight you", good guy act, that Van Damme used to put on in the eighties- if you dont know what I mean, watch the film, I mean B movie cause this is in no way a "film"!
