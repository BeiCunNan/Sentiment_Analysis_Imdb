Not much of a thriller, Juncture is a beautiful drama that also raises questions of moral importance. <br /><br />Lead Kristine Blackport (as Anna Carter) sometimes gives you the shudder. She makes you feel what Anna would feel if were in her place. <br /><br />Plot: Anna Carter is informed by her doctor that she has three months to live because she suffers from frontal-lobe Glioblastoma (a type of brain cancer). Tumors in the frontal lobe can cause changes in personality, thus the question whether her decision to kill child-molesters and other criminals is a matter of choice or of psychiatric nature hangs unanswered. As the plot goes forth, the moral and philosophical issues arising are inevitable, and the surprising end is a statement you can't forget. <br /><br />I liked it very much.
