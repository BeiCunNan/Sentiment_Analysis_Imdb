The Final Countdown is a great Aircraft Carrier movie. I really like Kirk Douglas as an actor. Imagining F-14 Tomcats shooting down Japanese Zeroes shows that America is still grouchy about the surprise attack at Pearl Harbour. Well it turns out that I have some Japanese DNA and that makes me neutral on the Battle of Pearl Harbour. <br /><br />Imagine if the day after President Jack Kennedy was supposed to have been assassinated, on November 23, 1963 when Captain Morrison took command of the Bonhomme Richard aircraft carrier it was really a still alive President Jack Kennedy. In 1963 the Boney carried nuclear weapons. I am sure that JFK had a super cruise. Then in 1964 according to the book Who Shot JFK? President Jack Kennedy was spotted at author Truman Capotes birthday Party still alive. No word of a lie it turns out that President Jack F Kennedy is my Great Uncle. A big hi to Clive Cussler in the bunker. I heard that the Secret Service agents had to carry you to the transportation. Now you know that my Great Uncle the American Shadow President Jack F Kennedy like lifeguarding like former President Reagan. I hope you are coping with the fact that we Democrats saved your republican behind. Remember that freedom of speech still exists so have fun writing or don't if you choose that course of action. It is rumored that the original creator of the Universe reads your books and is in our Solar system. <br /><br />If you look at the names Ki and Et aliens you can get the word kite, like they are someones kite, but do not be misled, the Care Rank Ki and others are highly likely to be some of the top sentient species in the Universe. If they encountered other aliens, the thought that they were someones kite might give the other guy a moment of pause. The other movies of Kirk Douglas are also good.
