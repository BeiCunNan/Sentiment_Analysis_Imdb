I'm a big fan of Caro's earliest work (delicatessen), and I'm AMAZED by the pile of non-sense & bad acting in that movie. From the very beginning you're filled with an "off" voice speaking about deeeeep philosophy & pathetic dramatic context explanations "we were doomed from the start" "it all began at the gates of hell", this kind of crap. That doesn't help at all when you can't figure out what the story line. What was the purpose of putting Wilson is this facility ? The dragon thing ? The lights ? It's small small fairy tail garbage, dressed with the "off" voice (omnipresent) repeating "we had no idea who he was...or where he came from" Neither do we...Amazing sets do NOT compensate the shallowness of the actors (my GOD !!), the forced tragic features of the plot...without mentioning the last sequence of the film, when Caro thinks he's the new Kubric. He's not. One of the worst films in my life. And I've seen quite a few. I want my hour & a half of time BACK !
