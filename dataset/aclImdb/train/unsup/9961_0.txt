<br /><br />"That Certain Summer" was more than just one of 1972's best productions made expressly for television. It was an outstanding presentation by any standard and for any medium. The entire cast, crew, and production team worked in fine ensemble fashion to create a memorable and significant achievement. This deserves to be revived and widely offered on video.
