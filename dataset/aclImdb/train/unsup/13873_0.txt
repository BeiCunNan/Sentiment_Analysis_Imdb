Wow was this BAD!!! Bette Davis (in her last film role sad to say) is a witch who marries Lionel Stander (wisely walking through his role) and invades his house which he shares with his adult children (Colleen Camp and David Rasche). Things "comically" spin out of control. Then Davis disappears (she wisely left after a week of shooting) and is replaced by sexy Barbara Carrera. With Davis gone this officially became unwatchable--I turned it off after an hour.<br /><br />Before this "Burnt Offerings" was Davis' worst film--this is 100 times worse! I admit she does have a fun opening line--"Call me mom!" but she looks terrible. Her speech is slurred because of one of the strokes she had and wears a terrible red wig. Davis was obviously very ill when she did this. Still, despite it all, she manages to make the most of her small screen time. All the dialogue is terrible with tons of unfunny comedy but Davis bravely makes the worst lines sound quite funny. And there is a somewhat funny visual joke revealing Camp's former mother was Joan Crawford! It's a shock seeing Davis looking this terrible and--basically--the film is just dreadful. MGM released THIS? Also when Carrara takes over it actually gets worse. She is very beautiful--but no actress.<br /><br />I only saw this because it was Davis' last film. I wish I hadn't. A total bomb. AVOID at all costs!!
