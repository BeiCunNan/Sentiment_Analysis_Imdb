As you may know, HBO is replaying "The Sopranos" in its entirety (years one through four)at the rate of one episode per week each Sunday evening. Sunday, February 9th, marked the second episode of year one and in the most timely fashion, Yancey Arias (Miguel of "Kingpin" fame) makes a brief appearance as a gay car thief (Arnaz). He almost took a bullet, but was spared the indignation so he could star another day, apparently.<br /><br />After having enjoyed the first two episodes of "Kingpin," I was a bit disappointed in the third installment of the series, although it had its moments, the canine shootings not being among them. Unbelievably, at least to me, "Kingpin" finished third in its timeslot, as it appears that the networks can continue to feed the masses predictably lame, tired and predictable programming and the herd will flock to it as if it were Aunt Bea's homemade apple pie. I'm expecting a very compelling fourth edition on Feb 11, which will serve as set up for the home stretch next week. If the last three episode are real strong, I think viewers will have found memories of "Kingpin," although daring to be different is not a guarantee of everlasting popularity.
