I love horror movies and among all the horror movies I have seen,this one is definitely one of the most scary ones.OK,its about thai voodoo,people cursing each other and getting revenged,the plot is ordinary,but how they torture each other in the movie is what its really about and the scariest part is it doesn't seem surreal at all,it seems like something it might actually just happen to you if you mess with the wrong people.<br /><br />I still remember after seeing the movie I was shivering all over,and couldn't get the crazy scene out of my head~it was like the first time i felt that way after seeing a horror movie,kind of cool in a way!For those horror-movie lovers out there,I'd say this one is a must see!
