this is a great murder mystery/psychological suspense thriller.this time it's Richard Gere who owns film.just a year earlier,Gere was in a movie called "primal fear,in which he played opposite Edward Norton.Norton owned that film,with his performance,and Gere does the same with this film.the film takes place in China,where an America lawyer(Gere) is on business.one morning,his world is turned upside down,as he finds himself accused of murder,with what seems an ironclad case against him. him.he must fight to free his name,all the while battling the corrupt Chinese government and justice system.this movie,like "Primal Fear,will have you on the edge of your seat,right to the end.Gere is brilliant in this here.i highly recommend it.for me,"Red Corner is mesmerizing.as a result,i give it 9/10
