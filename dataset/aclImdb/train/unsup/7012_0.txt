This film is the best of the Doug Maclure-Burrows films. Of course its bad, but in the best way. Tons of the monsters and effects that you loved as a kid! Harrihausen stop-motion animation in all its choppy glory still has an endearing quality that the sterile CGI effects of today could never duplicate.
