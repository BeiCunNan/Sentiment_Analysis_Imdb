This was a pretty faithful adaptation of Philip K. Dick's story, "The Second Variety". The only major difference is that instead of a Cold War setting on Earth, they used a corporate setting on a colony world.<br /><br />So why did this movie rock? Because they stuck to the story, which was quite a good one, of killer robots who decide to ignore their programming to attack the enemy and consider all humans the enemy, and have developed a way to replicate them in the process.<br /><br />Peter Weller, whom I don't consider a great actor, is at his best here, as a war weary commander who stumbles onto this shocking fact, as he tries to get back to his base to warn his comrades. Jennifer Rubin is pretty good as a killer android who doesn't know what she is until the climax.<br /><br />They gave it a happier ending than Dick did, but still, a solid film.
