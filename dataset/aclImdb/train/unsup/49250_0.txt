On the plus side, the acting is OK and the bleak atmosphere well sustained. But in place of a story we get a series of static and talky (because they come from stage-plays) and disconnected scenes, all much the same as one another. A string of shallow and unpleasant male characters strut about, spraying the testosterone, while all the women are pale and cowering mice, their only role to be threatened, humiliated and attacked by the men.<br /><br />The motive here is perfectly worthy  to give a feeling for a war-torn region  and the film approaches this by simply being relentless, which does help the atmosphere as noted. But soon enough we know what's going to happen almost before a scene begins and what should be shocking becomes merely tedious.<br /><br />This film is repetitive, dull, sexist, out of date in its attitudes and rather pointless. Nasty, annoying and a waste of time.
