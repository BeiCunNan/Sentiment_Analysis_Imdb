This is a typical dog/pet/foster child fitting in film. If you saw Free Willy, Homeward Bound, and Beethoven, (and maybe more) this film basically sums the three up in a way. Foster child (Chuckie) finds dog but can't have him, then dad (who is NFL kicker) has to work some where else, and Chuckie tries to take Bingo but leaves behind. Bingo makes his way cross country to find Chuckie, running into several obstacles. Eventually he runs into two crooks and puts them in jail. But when Bingo himself winds up into trouble not only does it complicate things for him because of the crooks, it also complicates things for Chucky. <br /><br />Pretty cheesy 80s film, few but strong horriable words, but yet the crooks do come up with a pretty (although sick) clever scheme when they get Chucky and Bingo.
