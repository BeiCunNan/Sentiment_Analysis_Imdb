Wow This film is so cool. Somehow it kinda reminded my of the film "Leon" a.k.a the professional. Clive Owen is such a great actor and he beautifies the film in the way he eats his carrots and also with all the tricks and stunts. The film also has a very good sense of humour and it made me laughed. The film is full on throttle action packed all the way and I find it very entertaining to watch. This film is how action films should be made and I would recommend to anyone interested in action films. The film basically is about guns and how cool they can be used if it is used by someone who is not a pussy XD. What makes a good film is not how serious it is but how entertaining it is and this one is.
