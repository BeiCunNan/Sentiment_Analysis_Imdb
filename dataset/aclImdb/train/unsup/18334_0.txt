If you like a mystery full of shadows and moody lighting, you'll quite enjoy this rambling yarn. John Hodiak (who looks here like a classic co-respondent in a divorce case), is an amnesiac, who wanders from clue to clue, from character actor to supporting player, in a sort of bemused trance as he tries to piece together who he is and why a certain Larry Cravat wrote him a mysterious note. The mystery holds for a while, then this viewer became a bit tired of scene after scene of talky explanations, and not much cinematic action. Fortunately Hodiak meets a nice girl, played by the charming Nancy Guild, and things looked up (for me). Nancy falls for John, for some reason, and believes in him, although he is becoming convinced that he may be a killer. On he rambles, trying to unravel, in murky apartments, the docks, an insane asylum, etc. There's Nazi loot and a nightclub, and Lloyd Nolan as a chummy cop, and lots of quirky characters (including one of my favourites, Housely Stevenson), who are there mainly to distract you, because Hodiak's character is so passive that he isn't even in the final scene - a cheery wash-up reminiscent of a mild sitcom.
