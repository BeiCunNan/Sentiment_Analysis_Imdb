I think upon all the episodes i watched it seams it talk about American history and all the suffering that America is facing from their enemies were caused by their great white leaders i think a black head of state can resolve this issues.And also i think if there such movies yet going to be released in the future all the main supporting characters should survived at least seven seasons before they are ripped off.Even though 24 is a very nice movie and it tells a lot about what America is capable i think America is boasting its self to the world that no one can touch them and it can also attract more enemies around the world by also tempting them in so many ways.
