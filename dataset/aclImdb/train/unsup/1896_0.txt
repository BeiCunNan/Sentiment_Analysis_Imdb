It's become a classic. The film has a recurring catchphrase that I don't know whether I like or loathe:<br /><br />"You're an asshole" "You really are" "I mean it"<br /><br />I'm guessing that this was the filmmakers secret weapon.<br /><br />But the BEST bit about this film was the big guy that was working in the diner and decided to follow the "baddies" to the ghost town.<br /><br />We only see him in three very short, but very, very crucial scenes from here on in.<br /><br />Scene I: He is seen modifying his hammer<br /><br />Scene II: Some time later, he is sharpening a sickle or something (I don't know, maybe he was a commie)<br /><br />I mean these two scenes would not be included if he had a minor role to play, right?<br /><br />So here is his big moment in scene III...<br /><br />Scene III: The guy turns up in the heat of the battle between good and evil. With his hammer in one hand and the sickle in the other he is about to deliver the final blow.....<br /><br />But is wiped out by one of the zombie cronies that was hanging about.<br /><br />All that suspense built up... and for what?<br /><br />And to cap it off, watch the credits roll, with names like The Priest and Animal guy going on and on.<br /><br />where were THESE people?<br /><br />Seriously, though. This is one film you HAVE to watch.
