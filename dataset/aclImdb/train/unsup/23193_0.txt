Well, I would have to say that I have been a true Lois and Clark fan since I was 6 years old...and boy do I miss the reruns that used to be on.<br /><br />I loved watching Dean and Teri. They had such amazing on-screen chemistry that made me wish they would end up together in real life. (I mean c'mon have you seen Teri's ex-husband Jon Tenney? Dean is way hotter!!!) The only thing I would have changed about Lois and Clark's relationship is to slow down their whole dating process. They only went out on one real date that the viewers saw and one implied date; and then Clark pops the question? I think that's when everything went downhill...but it was still enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />Teri and Dean I miss seeing your faces every morning but I am so counting the days until this show hits DVD in 2005!!!!<br /><br />When is the movie coming out?<br /><br />FoLC FOREVER!!!
