During my tenure as chief projectionist of the Commodore Cinema, Aberystwyth, the only film to have received a standing ovation on more than one night for a week's screening. It's a university town so we have a good mix of local punters, students and holiday people. I rest my case.<br /><br />The nineties was, on the whole, a good decade for cinema I think. All we seem to have had since then is a load of cgi filled soulless film equivalent of a fast food outlet (Hancock?). Maybe it's just me getting older.<br /><br />I checked out the "hated it" rating for Twin Town tonight, and was pleasantly surprised to see only two negative reviews receiving two stars or less. <br /><br />Bloody hell. Some bugger's just nicked my car..............
