Many complaints that have piled up so far are about this installment of Terminator not feeling like a "Terminator" movie. It is indeed very different. But this is a sort of reboot for the franchise. I almost wish they would have done this kind of movie for Star Wars. The picture is moving on (and ironically in the same sense, moving back because of the whole "sending robots to the past" thing). This is one of the best movies that I've seen in a long time. As a fan of the franchise, I was very scared that it would be disappointing and lack any content. But the story is pretty good and the action is top notch. I also appreciated the fact that they picked actors that could actually act. This really is a good piece of film making that is expanding on the Terminator universe. The action is so relentless and constant that I starting feeling tired and welcomed the dramatic scenes to calm down. Christian Bale was intense, Sam Worthington was extremely cool, and the rest of the cast performed decent or better. I look forward to seeing the sequel.
