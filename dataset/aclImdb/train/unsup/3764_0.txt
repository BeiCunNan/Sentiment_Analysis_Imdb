I remember seeing this short film when it first aired on Amazing Stories in 1987 and I thought that it was the funniest thing I had ever seen. Every character (including the dog who is silent) was extremely funny. I have never forgotten it and was looking for it all over the place (thank heaven for the internet). I watched it, and although the animation is not on par with anything that is out today, it is still probably one of the funniest things I have ever seen in my life. I cannot get it out of my mind (I think the same thing as the robber at the end, every morning when I have to walk my dogs). If you can, find it...If you can't, find it anyway, it will surely crack you up, dog lover or not.
