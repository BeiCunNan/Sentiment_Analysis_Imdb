Sorry to all the hysterical types who want to believe in this hokum-- simple physics is all that's needed to explain the collapse. Hold the explosives. Ask yourself why the narrator asks an unending stream of questions (and not very good ones). Why? Because this film contributes nothing, just dramatizes clouds of falling debris (which do hold a certain ghoulish fascination). "Why the Towers Fell" and other serious documentaries actually answer questions, present facts, and contain 100% less Carmina Burana. Pause a moment to remember those who perished that day, work for justice, understanding, and peace in the world. What the world doesn't need is more groundless suspicion, fear, and hysteria.
