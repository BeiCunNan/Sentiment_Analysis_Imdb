This is an odd little Korean film about 4 slacker-types who rob a gas station, and come back to rob it a second time. When they're mistaken for the attendants they realize that they'll do better by taking OVER the gas station and collecting the money. As time passes (this all takes place in one night) they amass a roomful of hostages that they've taken, all guarded by Bulldog, a not-too-bright lad with a floppy hat and a big stick. This says a lot about Korea, I guess, in that most people don't want a full tank of gas because it's so expensive, and a few other things that flicker by that indicate that the economy isn't exactly booming. Some of the comedy to this is pretty standard but there are some touches that put this above most action/comedies. There are flashbacks to failures of the 4 young men that show the frustrations that got them where they are at the time they decided take matters into their own hands. There is dumb humor in this but there's also some sly and dark humor thrown in here & there which redeems it. Overall I found this to be an amusing film but still it's a touch on the "light" side, a little more black humor could have made it a bit better.
