I applaud Mr Mangold for making an excellent film, and for telling a unique story. The motif of the dark stormy night, and the cheap motel invokes the a 'Film Noir' feel to the movie. Strong performances by all the cast, including John Cusack, Amanda Peet, and John C McGinley. This movie is an exploration of the "reality" of the inner mind, and it's power to shape reality to it's own preferences. My only criticism is that the movie seems to move backwards and forwards in some parts, thus confusing the viewer that the Point of View may be in flashback. I think the story would have been just as effective to not use the flashback scenes, and just show everything in chronological order. The flashback technique, though well executed in this movie, does nothing to enhance the story, or the viewer's understanding of the film, unless of course the director wanted to that merely to keep the audience off balance.
