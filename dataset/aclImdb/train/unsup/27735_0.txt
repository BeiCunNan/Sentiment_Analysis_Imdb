This movie was bad. Painfully bad. I am one of the ten or so people who actually saw this in the theater. I went with two friends on opening night and we were the only three people there.<br /><br />The first hint that the movie was bad was the premise: An East German inventor creates a car that runs on potatoes--or as he continually calls them "tubers." After the Berlin Wall falls, he moves to the U.S. to try to sell his invention. <br /><br />Most of the movie consists of painfully obvious "fish out of water"-type jokes. My assumption is that every actor and crew member who worked on it took the money and ran to cash their checks as quickly as possible.<br /><br />Avoid this movie like the plague. Please. Your brain will thank you.
