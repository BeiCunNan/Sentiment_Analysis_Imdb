This is just a rotten 100% commercial sequel. The only point of is to make money out of the fact that young children enjoy to see new movies with characters they already know. Unfortunately, in this case, the main characters were originally meant to just go along with the flow of their destiny, and they are so completely devoid of personality that they just don't "fit in" as heroes who take their lives in their own hands! Worse: there isn't even a "real" villain to make the story interesting, the evil stepmother stays pretty much in the background, and Anastasia... well, she's not much of a villain, is she? All that happens in the film comes down to much ado about nothing, it's boring and pointless. A total waste of time and money (that will probably leave your kids completely brainwashed on top of it).
