Tom is playing a round of pool, and cheating if I might add, not knowing that Jerry is sleeping in one of the pockets, when Tom sinks a ball into said pocket crushing Jerry, a game of hilarious cat and mouse antics begin once again. This animated short has a great setup, funny gags, and a superb ending. What more could one really ask for from the comedic duo? Highly recommended for fans of Tom and Jerry both old and new. You are sure to be delighted by the wacky hijinks. I guarantee it. This cartoon can be found on disc two of the Spotlight collection DVD of "Tom & Jerry" <br /><br />My Grade: A
