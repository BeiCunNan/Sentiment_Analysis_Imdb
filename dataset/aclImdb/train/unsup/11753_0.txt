I think that this movie can´t be taken to seriously. If you read other comments you will find a lots of complains. I say: Don´t pay to much attention to those. Although this movie is childish and predictable, its content is funny as hell and the actors are perfect for their rolls.<br /><br />Don´t crap it down people because it was a long time ago that i had such fun at the cinema! Go Fares!! 10/10 for the comedy!
