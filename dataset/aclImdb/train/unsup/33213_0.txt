This movie is so bad. You can easily tell when they use the CGI for the dog and it looks terrible anyways. The fight scenes with the dog looked awkward and bad. The voice of the dog was so annoying that every time he talked I died a little on the inside. This movie is so low budget, and its worse than other low budget movies like "Snakes on a Train", and "Ninja Cheerleaders". The continuity in the movie is terrabad. The "trained assassins" (according to the movie) were people in generic thug costumes and had no weapons, they also got beat up by a CGI dog that was movie faster than a dog physically could. The main villain is a guy wearing a white mask who can't talk unless he is holding his neck. This movie deserves a rating of -10/100 but I rated it a 1 because I had to. You know, by 2004 I thought that there would be some standards when making movies but, I guess I was horribly mistaken. In the part of the movie where the dog puts the disk in the computer that makes every other computer in the building explode with sparks that is just unreal, you can tell that the dogs paw is no connected to its body and is just a sock puppet. This movie is bad. It's Danton bad.
