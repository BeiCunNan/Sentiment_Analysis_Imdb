Any movie coming out in 2005 and having King Kong in it (although unnamed and in a bit part) is going to suffer badly. Mind you this movie deserves to. Only loosely following the classic Conan Doyle story, and not a patch on the old 1925 silent classic (which incidentally cast Sir Arthur Conan Doyle playing himself) This movie is just far to bitty to be enjoyable, with many plot holes which will leave you asking questions. It also seems to suffer from being updated, maybe it would have been better to have set it in the period it was wrote in. One gains no sympathy whosoever for the cardboard cutout characters, and couldn't care less as they are killed off one by one. Even the end of King Kong, by nuclear weapon, is done somehow in an unspectacular manner!. All in all it leaves one feeling bored and deflated.
