This movie is not underrated. I think it deserves being rated poorly. Even though I do think the main guy is good at acting like a slimeball, the story is not very exciting. I also do not like the main woman's hair, she looks like a skunk. There are some moments of slapstick that seem a little odd (like the cake falling on the sun bathing torso).<br /><br />All in all, this movie is not very memorable. 3/10 for a potentially interesting idea and a good lead character.
