SCREWBALL COMEDY THAT PROVES THEY DON'T MAKE 'EM LIKE THEY USED TO Nothing Sacred is taut satire in the newspaper and screwball genre made in the 1930s in the wake of similar type movies such as Front Page(1931),Bombshell(1933) and many others. It is a movie with the 2 stars in top form Carol Lombard as the faux heroine in one of her best roles,which would includ Twentieth Century(1934),My Man Godfrey(1936),To Be or Not to Be and others. Also starring Fredric March as the Newspaper reporter from New York who will do anything to hype a story and it is at least one of his Top 10 roles and he had many great ones including deserved Oscars for his performances in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde(1932) and Best Years of Our Lives(1946). The supporting roles as played by Walter Connoly as the Newspaper editor and Charles Winninger as the the horse doctor are superb. tHIS ZANY FARCE IS DONE IN A MANNER THAT THEY JUST CAN'T DUPLICATE TODAY OR PROBABLY NOT SINCE THE 1950S and it is a joy to behold. This is a great comedy and one that is a treasure and a gem-just appreciate that they once made a bunch of comedies of this quality-This is one of the Greatones-though I wouldn't quite put it in the masterwork/All-Time Great Category.
