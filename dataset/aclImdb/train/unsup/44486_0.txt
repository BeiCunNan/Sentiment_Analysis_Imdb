Just watched this film last night - I was disappointed enough to get of my ass and write this review! <br /><br />I've read quite a few of other reviews and I disagree that the movie is visually stunning. Although the desert has a certain beauty, I wasn't impressed by the actual filming techniques. There was nothing above ordinary with how the movie was shot - with the exception of the "human lab" scene with the white silhouettes of figures, but that seemed a bit gimmicky to me - the novelty wore off quick.<br /><br />As many others have noted, the pace of the editing was unbearably slow. There doesn't seem to be any purpose to the excessively drawn out scenes other than to make a 15 minute movie into a feature length. I've seen "2001: A Space Oddessy" many times and feel that the slow pace in that film fits the themes of isolation, infinity, quiet in space, etc.<br /><br />This film was SO abstract and vague that you can't help but ask a lot of questions like: What's the robot's function/purpose? Do humans even exist on this planet? Why are there toilets if everyone is a robot? Have others attempted to become human? <br /><br />So they become human (or wear human masks anyways)- why do they just stroll down the street after? They have nothing better to do? Is their sole purpose just to show off their new faces and get a reaction out of others? And OK - so the other robots (whom I assume they don't know) don't seem to approve of their transformation.....why do the two main characters even give a shi* ? <br /><br />If this film were transposed to a different world where a couple of young guys decided to become drag queens, walked down to Anytown, USA and then were ostracized - you think they would wander back to the desert and commit suicide??? Of course not - and that's why this movie makes no sense.<br /><br />The best films make you care about the protagonists and identify with them on some level. The two main characters in this film are two-dimensional and weak. I think the story would have been much more interesting if they actually dealt with the rejection and came up with a different solution other than self-destruction. <br /><br />I didn't learn anything from this film, I don't see the world any differently, and I wasn't even entertained for the hour-plus that I wasted watching it.<br /><br />Daft Punk should have just stuck with Interstella 5555 for their cinematic contributions.
