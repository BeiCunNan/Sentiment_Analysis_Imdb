This was one of those underground independent films that just happened to be really good. Director Darren Doane is mostly known to us as a Music Video Director bringing us videos from bands like Blink 182 and MxPx. A good film to watch from a music video director. If you see the DVD Special Edition you can see the original Godmoney film starring Christian Bale (Empire of the Sun, Little Women, American Psycho).
