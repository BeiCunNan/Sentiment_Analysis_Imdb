There was once a time when it could at least be considered understandable for people to be caught up in the myth of the "orient." Few people had ever been and the people who had been, brought back wondrous things such as spice and pottery back to their fellow European barbarians.<br /><br />Those days are long since gone and yet some people feel compelled to keep the "exotic Asia" myth alive in film and literature and this film is one such example. The plot is silly and largely unexplained -but that does not matter! The pacing is PAINFULLY slow -but that does not matter! The acting is wooden at best and the characters all mysteriously speak English -but that does not matter either!<br /><br />The opening scene with the skinny Asian woman naked in the hot spring turning to look coyly at the camera should be enough to tell that the only thing the filmmakers cared about was to give audiences some steamy scenes and another tale of the exotic seductiveness of Asia.<br /><br />Even if that is your thing, I recommend that you skip this movie for better adventures elsewhere.
