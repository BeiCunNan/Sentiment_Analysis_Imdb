I rented this movie just after it had come out on video. I knew it wasn't going to be a HotDog-ish movie, but I was still expecting something fun. I'm not even going to comment on my beefs as a skier. But as a movie in general, it was the most depressing piece of c**p ever! It just kept getting worse and worse, and the ending didn't even come close balancing off all that had happened. When it was over, I felt like my dog had just died.<br /><br />I think this movie just tried to be too many things that just didn't fit together - trying to make HotDog into a chickflick while still being cool is just plain impossible.
