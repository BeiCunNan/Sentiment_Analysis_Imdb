I came across this film by chance as I was channel surfing during a lazy day at home. I sat down to watch it thinking it was simply an average, not-terrible-but-not-fantastic movie. After the first half an hour, I was pleasantly surprised at the fact that the film was actually NOT 'just another movie'.<br /><br />This film demonstrates how a dedicated director, stellar acting by talented individuals and beautifully written screenplay can transform a movie into an extremely enjoyable viewing experience.<br /><br />This movie evoked a lot laughs from me and left me glued to the television. It's not a big-budget film but I can honestly say that this film easily tramples other similar movies. This proves that you don't need deep pockets and mass promotions to create a classic.<br /><br />For those film junkies like me out there, I HIGHLY recommend watching this. It fuses dramatic comedy with hints of romance and generally a feel-good experience. I salute John Jeffcoat for such a very beautiful film. Josh Hamilton, Ayesha Darker and all the other cast members from India blew me away with their exemplary performance. You will see no famous faces here but let me warn you, this is definitely a film that will leave you with warmth and all-around fuzziness with its unique flavor.<br /><br />Excellent pacing, inspiring storyline and a catchy soundtrack mold this film into one of those you'll be sharing with your friends while having a good laugh here and there.<br /><br />Two thumbs up! Well done, guys! THIS is the sort of film Hollywood should pay more attention too. Films such as this deserve more exposure and the spotlight should be concentrated on the talented actors/actresses involved.
