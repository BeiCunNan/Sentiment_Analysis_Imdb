But this quickly became the most exploitive and narrow minded experience I have ever witnessed. I have never seen an actual American tragedy so exploited for the sake of one singular goal....to provoke anger and hatred. This "film" served no other purpose than to create deep hatred and resentment. It would amount to the same effect if the 9/11 footage of those planes crashing into the WTC were shown a hundred years from now, and the viewers were intentionally misled into believing that these crashes happened all over America that day, that every single American was physically harmed, and every person from Middle Eastern descent was responsible. Written words from the survivors would be read by future celebrities who are sure to emphasise pain and hate...more pain and hate...and yet, more pain and hate. Never explaining the origins of the tragedy, the after effects of the tragedy, nor the eventual lessons learned and the healing of the tragedy. The future viewers would simply be filled with HATE for all Middle Eastern people. If anyone who is even remotely responsible for participating in Unchained Memories claims this film had any other intentions except to pour salt on a re-opened wound, then I would boldly call them a liar. This film is by no means an emotional, informative and enlightening event. It is flat out a racist piece of propaganda that repulsively used an actual, horrific tragedy to base it's venom upon. I bet every time it's shown on HBO, black on white crime increases all over America. The makers of this "Hate Film" can claim 'mission accomplished.' Jeez, I can't wait to see the tunnel vision, hate film about the Jewish holocaust....maybe the makers of Unchained Memories can do an equally superior job of distorting and manipulating that tragedy.
