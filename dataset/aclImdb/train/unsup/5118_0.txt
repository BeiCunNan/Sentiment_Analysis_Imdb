"Twilight Zone"s Rod Serling creates another creepy TV series: "Night Gallery." A series of paintings that lead into another dimension.<br /><br />This is the TV movie that started it all: a series of paintings that were helmed by Boris Sagal, Steven Spielberg, and Barry Shear.<br /><br />The first segment is about a swine nephew who kills his uncle in order to inherit his fortune; the second segment is about a blind woman who gets an eye transplant; and the third segment is about a former Nazi who is trying to escape his past, but a Holocaust survivor denies him of that.<br /><br />My favorite was, of course, the second segment. I thought it was a fantastic effort on Spielberg's part. You could definitely tell that the youngling director had some talent then.
