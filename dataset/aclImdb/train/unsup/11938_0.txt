Out of all the Species movies series, this one takes the cake! After the offspring of Sil, this new breed of alien was doing the same thing: finding a mate for her offspring. Then there's another alien who wants to cause trouble by killing everyone in her path. Going to different places for some answers, someone gets offed. Who to trust, who to avoid it's hard to say there. The reason why I don't like this movie is because it's way oversexed, the plot was rather pointless, it was weak, decadent, and played out period. The cast of the movie was fine the only one I thought helped was the guy from the first Species movie as the motel manager who was indeed the original one. Everyone else just didn't sell me. Species 1, 2, and 3 gave out promises: 1 was subtle, 2 was slightly intense, 3 was hardcore and extreme. The 4 one is NOT a keeper in my book! SORRY! 1 STAR!
