"I've got it, Jim!" "What's that, George?" "What are the two subjects we can combine to evoke sympathy from a guilt-ridden audience while still being original in an annoying Paulie Shore kind of way?" "The Holocaust and a team of break-dancing ninjas from the future?" "NO! Slavery and time-travel!" "C'mon George, no one can possibly take that seriously. In fact, that brings up a good question, why would you have to use a plot device as crazy as time travel in order to make people empathize with slaves?" "Screw you, you're fired. (To an aide) Get me some yes-men!" <br /><br />That essentially summarizes my feelings about San Kofa. Why would you use something as ridiculous as time travel to highlight the horrors of slavery? Why would you put jazz music into a rape scene? Why would you put subtitles in for someone speaking English in a strange accent IN that strange dialect of English?
