Quite a well-made film reminding of Point of Destination. In some parts definitely smarter than the latter (nb: and made one year earlier).<br /><br />Mainly suitable cast, good score, rainy melancholy-soaked background, odd camera angles etc. First half of the film is in fact nearly excellent (something like a very good Millennium episode, only - series in question never got that good). Unfortunately afterwards some certain slack in the intrigue starts to show up when the authors tend to delay obvious revelations and artificially hold up things from happening. No particular special effects, but thoroughly created atmosphere. A jolly good Christopher Lloyd.<br /><br />Bottomline, apparently not an 'A' feature, but indeed worth watching for fans of a diverse range of films: Xfiles, Millennium, Point of Destination, Fallen, Prophecy etc.
