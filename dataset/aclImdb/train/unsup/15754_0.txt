I saw this movie on Sci-Fi channel so I'm sure I missed out on the best of the nudity and gore but I was still fascinated by it. I couldn't figure out what was so unique about it until about halfway through. This is like a good porno but with no sex ! <br /><br />All the women are hot and while they appear in some provocative outfits and there are "sexual situations" nobody actually has sex. The acting is on the same cheesy level that is about the best that adult films can hope for. The story is bizarre and gimmicky enough ( but without the gory payoff that horror films should deliver ) to be a fetish-y porno. The main female characters ( The dominatrix, brainy wife behind the business tycoon, The all-girl rock band, The hot Asian lawyer) are all porn character staples played by adult-film caliber actresses ( no, wait - I mean that as a compliment ! ) <br /><br />Most of the male actors make no impression. The exceptions are the lead actor, playing Virgil Travis ( the actor somewhat handicapped by the fact that he's basically a walking special effect ) and the actor playing his right-hand man, Mr. Mascaro. Mascaro is a stone cold killer who wears clown makeup throughout the film, a deadpan expression on his face throughout. The only exception is one scene where he must go out "in disguise". After returning from this mission he reapplies his makeup and says " I'm so glad to be out of that disguise " ( meaning his bare face ) <br /><br />A weird, unique film, much more than I expect from Full Moon, and I can't help but think that the "greatness" is nothing that they could have planned on ( or achieved if they'd tried )
