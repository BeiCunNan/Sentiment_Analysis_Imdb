SPOILERS - READ WITH CAUTION<br /><br />While this movie claimed to not follow any rule, there was still one big general rule that really should have been followed - as pointed out by Randy Meeks (who makes an appearance via a recording filmed before his death), at the end of a trilogy, ALL BETS ARE OFF. A main character (a.k.a someone from the original) should die. There will be more blood, more gore, more excitement and a killer ending. This is no ordinary sequel. But of course, Scream 3 fails to fire in these areas.<br /><br />It doesn't match up to the first 2 with their wit, thrills and quality. What we get instead is a product that doesn't really excite and leaves the viewer yawning. The ending was far-fetched and in all honesty is rather stupid and had me shaking my head. <br /><br />Some moments were good. A variety of cameos were worth a smile and so was Jamie Kennedy's video recording. <br /><br />Overall, could of done better. 5/10<br /><br />
