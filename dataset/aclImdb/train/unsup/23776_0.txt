A pair of sisters and their boyfriends-none of whom you care about, visit an old family inheritance. Surprise, there's a pair of inbred killers on the loose, as well as some dark family secrets.<br /><br />"Lake Dead" is a movie with too many flaws to count. I could go on with the poorly done gore (done either with CG or badly done Make-Up-though that pick-ax to the face bit is pretty awesome), the two inbred brothers that look like shaved versions of the Geico cavemen (I'm surprised they didn't start complaining about cavemen being depicted as inbred killers)-and are pretty much lifted off of "Just Before Dawn" and the "Wrong Turn" movies (the film feels basically like the people behind it just saw "Wrong Turn" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" remake-the sheriff is right out of the "Chainsaw" remake), but I'll go with other problems instead.<br /><br />For one thing, the acting-with the exception of Pat McNeely as the demented grandmother-is terrible on all accounts. Also, the film is rather misogynistic. None of the men suffer worse than the women, yet only the men come off as tough, while the women are basically weak and feeble. Really, this movie pretty much sets women back. At least give the audience a final girl to root for! <br /><br />Going into "Lake Dead", I wasn't expecting an original movie. I knew it would be another Evil Inbred Family/Backwoods horror movie. Unfortunately, it's a bad one, which offers nothing interesting, and ends up leaving both a bad taste in your mouth and a sense of "why did I just waste my time?"
