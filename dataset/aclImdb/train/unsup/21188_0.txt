The silliness of Cary Grant being too embarrassed and afraid of hurting his bride's feelings to tell her what happened--and the screwball results--gives way at the end to an interesting play of sexual tension between husband and wife as the wife refuses to give "privileges" till her husband affirms, not just his passion, but his commitment to her and the family. <br /><br />For a comic but sophisticated peek at what men and women need from each other, it joins Friendly Persuasion and The Quiet Man.<br /><br />Casting is excellent--you can't feel very sorry for the wronged bride or for the cheerful disappointed suitor; the kids are funny, neither sentimentalized nor smart alecky; the judge and hotel manager are gems; and Cary Grant and Irene Dunne manage to generate sparks while seeming as comfortable together as old shoes.
