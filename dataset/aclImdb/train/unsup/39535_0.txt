And by that I mean the now almost countless bad TV shows with directors who think shaking the camera at everything is cute.<br /><br />NYPD Blue started that awful trend, and while NYPD Blue was strangely still a hit (but not as big at it would have been had it been well shot!) thanks to its great writing in the first season, its progeny is stinking up the airwaves.<br /><br />Film is an art form and doing that with the camera makes a mockery out of it.<br /><br />A sad legacy for Steven Bochco who should be remembered from the epically well-produced L.A. Law.
