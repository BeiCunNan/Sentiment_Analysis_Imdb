Gene Tierney was not convincing at all in this film. The longer I watched the less I liked her character. "Oh, I've been arrested for murder, but I don't want to hurt my husband's reputation by admitting to stealing a pin!" Her failure to say anything just aggravates the audience. Apparently, the writer forgot what elements are needed to encourage the viewers to care about the victims. They either need to be mentally-challenged or fully able to execute rational decisions. They can't be in-between? One minute she's reasonably independent, the next she can't even spit out what's on her mind. Annoying... It causes you to loose interest, because you don't care what happens to her.
