Silly, impressionable young teens will probably go for this idiotic time waster but all others should be offended. I found all those schoolboys to be irritating beyond belief and Ryder to be sluggish and phony. How convenient for the young lads to have totally empty hallways in a house full of rambunctious boys as they brought in the limp body of a woman and placed her in their room. How lucky for them that they drug her all over the place for hours without anyone but their closest buddies finding out their secret. Calmest dorm I've ever witnessed. -100 stars; a world full of thumbs all pointing down.
