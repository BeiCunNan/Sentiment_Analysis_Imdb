now my comment on this, isn't gonna reflect much on how Stephen king did it, more on what he stole from the original, for Gods Sake Even Dr. Stegman's ending line is ripped off to the core, just replacing Danes with Maine. The Original story is a Masterpiece, why mess with perfection? At Least Riget actually exists in real life (the Hospital in Copenhagen is Nicknamed "Riget" which Means "Kingdom", Due to it's Extreme size) And to round it all off, maybe Stephen could have continued the series instead of remaking it, since two actors died after making the second one (hence why there isn't gonna be a third). Stephen if you run out of ideas, don't just copy - work for it!
