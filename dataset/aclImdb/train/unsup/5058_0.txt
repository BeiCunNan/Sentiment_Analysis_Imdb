After watching Entre tinieblas (1983), I did not have high expectation s for this film. However, this film is much better than I expected. The story is solid, reasonable and well constructed. The characters are likable and convincing. They also put a lot of thoughts in the various shooting locations, such as the decorations of the various homes etc. I am impressed by this movie.
