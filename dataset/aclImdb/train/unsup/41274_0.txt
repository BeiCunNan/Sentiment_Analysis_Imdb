The movie Contagion was kind of disappointing in that I thought it would be have a better story line. The acting was not very good, some parts were believable but other times it was so just fake! You didn't really feel as if they were living this like it was happening. The flow of the movie was really choppy. The scenes would jump really ahead and you had to just assume things had happened because the story didn't tell you. The storyline was very sorry, this could have happened but a lot of the things that happened is defiantly not how the scientists would have handled it. The bomb would have just pushed the disease further out so that would have never happened. The scientist would have acted a lot more cautious. The ending was just how a normal movie would end, the bad guy dies and of course everyone is saved.
