I am watching the DVD while writing this comment. It's almost at the end of it, and I will be glad when it will be over. I imagine myself to be trapped inside a cinema to watch this crap. It would be simple torture.<br /><br />Some Philippino is testing his new videocam, and he sells it as a movie. The main 'actor' is so bad that I think he never had one lesson of acting in his life. The camera follows him through the dirty streets of Manila, and it will do the job to prevent you ever to go to that country. That's the good side effect of the movie.<br /><br />It says on the DVD cover that it won some prices. I wonder if was shown to a deaf and blind jury. Sorry for being so harsh, but I read many times on this website: This was the worst movie etc. But this one really wins the price.
