Although I am not by any means obsessed with "South Park," I do think it's a very funny show and the film adaptation was hilarious. Trey Parker and Matt Stone can be quite funny and I thought certain scenes of "Team America" were genius. (And others... not so much.) But their second film outing, "Orgazmo," has to be their weakest effort. I expected a clever and crude satire of the porn industry -- instead I just got stupid crude humor without many laughs.<br /><br />I did chuckle a few times, at some jokes that were so obvious and over-the-top and juvenile that they hit the funnybone if you're in an amiable mood. But this is very selective taste and I'm sure most people wouldn't even find the silly jokes funny.<br /><br />Joe Young (Parker) is a Mormon who is recruited to star in a series of porn films called "Orgazmo." Essentially the film is a kick in the face to religion and caused a lot of controversy when it was released. The MPAA tagged it with an NC-17 rating and it flopped on release.<br /><br />It has a weak cult following now due to the success of Parker and Stone's reputations as funny troublemakers, but the fact is that "Orgazmo" really is just controversial for the sake of being so. It's not nearly as funny as it thinks it is.<br /><br />On top of that, the new DVD is a huge disappointment also. The cast commentary track is inaudible and barely distinguishable. The "Wild" commentary track is similarly hard to hear and pretty poor. When I read that Kevin Smith and Weird Al Yankovic were on the track I thought, "Wow." Little did I know that they are split into separate groups and only on the track for about ten minutes each. Yankovic is the funniest but most of his jokes are lame. Smith has never seen "Orgazmo" and only relays a story of how he used to hate Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and his audio is recorded from a telephone conversation.<br /><br />The documentaries are stupid and poor and the rest of the special features are just plain lame.<br /><br />Overall, a really disappointing experience.
