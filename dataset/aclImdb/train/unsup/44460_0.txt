I had high hopes for this, but wound up despising it. This is pacifism with a broad brush, absolutely sophomoric in it's persistent delivering of the kind of message that makes "turn the other cheek" resemble heroism.<br /><br />I just hope impressionable children are not being exposed to this defeatist philosophy.<br /><br />Pushing this movie's obvious message to kids is like passing around the bubonic plague.<br /><br />The actors are first-rate but are squandered here in my opinion.<br /><br />In WWII actors flew bombers or fought for their country on the beaches and were slogging along in the infantry for years in dangerous terrain. Regrettably, things have deeply changed in the USA. Hollywood has become the mouthpiece of the left. This movie was produced in the 60s and bears the stamp of those times, times when the inmates tried to run the asylum--and very nearly succeeded.<br /><br />So watch and enjoy the fine acting in this film, but don't succumb to it's defeatist message.
