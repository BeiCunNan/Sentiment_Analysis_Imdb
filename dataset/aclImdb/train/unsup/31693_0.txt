This film was specially shown on January 17, 2006 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture "explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life." Heartland gave that award to this film.<br /><br />There are seven rather naughty children who have creatively and gleefully drove away seventeen nannies who tried to tame them. But they have met their match with the hideous looking Nanny McPhee played by Emma Thompson. Thompson wrote the screenplay and with great make-up plays Nanny McPhee. Thompson is a consummate artist and is the only person ever to have won an Oscar for writing ("Sense and Sensibility") and also to have won an Oscar for acting ("Howard's End). Thompson brings class to this Victorian-era, dark, fractured fairy tale.<br /><br />This is a laugh out loud farce. And young people and old can share in the humor. While the film is designed for kids, the adult accompanying the child will enjoy it almost as much.<br /><br />There are positive messages, for parent and child, throughout the film. The seven children are taught to listen and to be courteous and to be responsible and to think through things for themselves, and you watch their behavior evolve. In the beginning, goodness looks ugly to the children. But as they learn what goodness truly is, it takes on a beautiful appearance.<br /><br />FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.
