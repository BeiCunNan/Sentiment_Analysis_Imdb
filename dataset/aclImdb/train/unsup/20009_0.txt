The movie is truer to the original Tarzan of E.R.Burroughs than almost any other one I've seen and I've watched them for over 40 years and have read 10 of the original books. Although the acting may not be first rate the story line isn't too far from the City of Opar book. I'd prefer more of the "savage, but civilized" side of Tarzan to be portrayed, along with less chimp and fake gorillas.
