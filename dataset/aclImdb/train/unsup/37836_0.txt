Very rarely do you see a film with this high of a budget being unilaterally bad, imagine Ed Wood with more money and far less charm. Imagine the stupidest scenes in Independence Day coupled with the worst of Michael Bay's films and you really don't get close to how bad this film is. Everyone involved in this project is doing the worst thing they've ever done. This includes John Travolta who was also in Staying Alive, Two of a Kind and Swordfish, which are comparative masterpieces.<br /><br />The cinematography (though no evidence exists to suggest that cameras weren't held by blind apes who pointed towards wherever noise was coming from) is consistently awful. The 'script' is bad enough to make George Lucas look as subtle as Tarkovsky, take for example: <br /><br />Chirk: I am going to make you as happy as a baby Psychlo on a straight diet of kerbango.<br /><br />The acting, considering the fairly accomplished people involved is laughably hammy. Barry Pepper and Forest Whittaker (though behind the make-up you can't really tell) are both lucky to have made this film and not subsequently been relegated to making soft-core porn and reality TV.<br /><br />Filled with plot holes, poor special effects, bad acting, worse writing, no direction and a soundtrack that would annoy deaf people, this 'film' has less artistic merit than a theoretical snuff movie written by Joe Eszterhas, directed by Uwe Boll and staring Brendan Fraser. Truly and utterly abhorrent.
