Well how should I describe this movie... the very first scene of the movie itself sets the background of the movie and tells about the masterpiece we are going to witness in the next 155 minutes....... Have you heard the song "doli me Bithay Ke Kanhar..."......? I bet you will forget the songs of recent times.... both son and father namely RD Burman and SD burman and the excellent sharmila Tagore will make you cry in the song............. Well you will take a long time to recover from the movie after watching it .... but if you don't watch it interestingly you will not like it much.... It is very artistic and touchy in its flavour....... It is bound to make you emotional in a very different way. Shakti Da has this great capability of making you cry by his character's plight and on the top of that the music matches the atmosphere of the movie bit by bit.... RD Burman was at his best in this movie.... the songs are incorporated in the movie to carry the viewer into the mind of the character.the lyrics are marvellous. Rajesh Khanna is unstoppable. Don't have words to express how he acted in the movie. As for Sharmila Tagore, she was the same as rajesh khanna.. the second half of the movie is quite touching..... Look at the way the song "BADA NATKAHT HAI" is used in the background when Vinod Mehra returns to search pushpa.. I recommend this movie to all who haven't seen what Indian directors are capable of. watch it to know it.............
