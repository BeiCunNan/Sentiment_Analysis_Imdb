this is the second filmed version of Richard Matheson's novel,I am Legend,the first being The Last Man on Earth,starring Vincent price,and the third bearing the same title as the novel and,starring Will Smith.i really enjoyed the first version,and pretty much hated the third version.this version is,much closer to the third version,in terms of my opinion of it.i found a lot of this movie lame,lacking in any real excitement.the acting was pretty poor(though Heston wasn't too bad).i also felt the movie was a bit too talky at times,and there is no real air of mystery to the story.having said that,there was one good thing about it.this one had a plot,(as slow as it was)which i felt the third one didn't.it was just this side of boring,for the most part,occasionally slipping over into the area of boredom.i was able to get through it.but i wouldn't care if i never saw it again.it just really didn't anything for me.my vote for The Omega Man is a 3/10
