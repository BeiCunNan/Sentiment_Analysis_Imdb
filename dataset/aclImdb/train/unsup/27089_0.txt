The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai has withstood critical blasting and a studio that tried to kill it to become one of the quirkiest little cult films in the past 20 years. Stocked with a cast of actors and actresses who were all on the verge of becoming big, "Banzai" is just plain fun. A pulp character that was never printed in pulp magazines brought to life, a Doc Savage for the 80's, Buckaroo is something you watch for pure enjoyment, not personal enlightenment.
