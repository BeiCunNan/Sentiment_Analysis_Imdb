I have been watching the Indigo project from go. From when it was just a pipe dream. I'm glad it got made and that I finally got to see the movie. The movie Indigo is about the Indigo children, of which I am one. I may not be as in-tune as the girl in the movie, but the movie touched me very deeply. It has the potential to help millions of children like me who were misdiagnosed as ADD/ADHD and their parents and friends. Indigo children are special children who have come to help the planet evolve. There is a book called the Indigo Children by Lee Caroll & Jan Tober,which also should help indigo children and their parents. There are also other books out there on Indigo and Crystal Children. Thank you James Twyman for making this movie and to all who were involved with it.
