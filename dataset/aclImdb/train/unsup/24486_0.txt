I've also collected many of 'The Destroyer' books, and at one time had close to 100 of them. When I came across this pilot, I sat down eagerly to see how they had handled the character. Two words: Very Disappointing. But what can you do in such a short time? The characters were wooden, the plot almost non-existent and the production values very low.<br /><br />Having a copy of the program might be something that the hardcore Destroyer fan might covet, most people would simply tape over the program once they watched it.<br /><br />If it had been produced a few years later, and came out on a cable channel, where the idea of a Perfect Assassin could be developed, then it might have had a chance.
