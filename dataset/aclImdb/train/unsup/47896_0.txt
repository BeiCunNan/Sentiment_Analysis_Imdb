Although my comment is based on seeing the whole movie, it won't differ much from what was said by people who couldn't stand it entirely. What's worth of this movie are (maybe) the fight scenes, but they are islands in an ocean of boredom. The characters are impossibilities, the plot, although overly twisted, doesn't manage to keep the interest, and the beast's FX are worse than those in 1984's Terminator I. Rating: 3/10, thanks to the fight scenes (pity they don't comprise 30% of the movie's length).
