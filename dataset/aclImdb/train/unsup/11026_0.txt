Brick Bronsky stars as an intellectual muscle man who ends up protecting the girl of his dreams (Translated the only girl who will sleep with him) from corporation lackeys as well as a group of fat bikers who dominate the college. Oh and there are subhumanoids who are created and melt down with little of explanation, although the professor(Lisa Gaye) who sports a Marge Simpson haircut has a cure and being that Bronsky's girlfriend is a subhumanoid, he wants the cure. Of course education takes a backseat to non-stop bizarre set-pieces. Because last month was Halloween I did a non-stop binge on horror movies (AKA movies found in my horror section)and I saw this with the first. The first movie was made with gross out humor but also with restraint that things never got too out of control. Not so here, as Class Of Nukem High II is so bizarre and surreal that it's a non-stop assault on not only your senses but also your common sense and your physical being in general. You will not find a more weird film and yet I admit some of this went a long way, just not enough to be worth putting money down on. Reviewing this movie is hard because it's meant to be bizarre and there is tons of imagination and moments where the humor works but it's just so weird. And my taste in movies is hardly mainstream.<br /><br />** Out of 4-(Fair)
