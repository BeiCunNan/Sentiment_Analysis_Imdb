Another film made about Sydney's so called 'disaffected BORING youth, who apparently are uneducated, mean , self indulgent, lazy and completely unrepresentative of Australia. Nobody in the public asked for this film to be made and when released in 3 cinemas... none of which were in the western suburbs because the distributor knew already nobody West would see it... it was a compete financial failure again again again wasting public taxpayer funds which were spent 'creating' this turgid drivel.. This film has NO market. The public will not leave their homes and pay $16 to see this boring ugly junk in any cinema anywhere. It did not work in 1978 with THE FJ HOLDEN , nor again with MALLBOY in 2000 and anywhere in between... so why is it here again? dunno. and there it goes... west. Waste. Insulting waste to Australia and the taxpayer funded film finance scheme. This film needs to go to "Brat Camp".. and as even 5 year olds say in Australia:.."bugger off".
