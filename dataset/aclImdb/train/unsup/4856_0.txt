I remember when this film was being filmed in my hometown which seemed so long ago. Woody Allen and his crew came to my town for a couple of days and shot the diner scenes in South Amboy at this old fashioned diner. Unfortunately, the business was moved to New York but anyway I remember the newspaper that covered it. I never saw the film until years later. I recognized the diner and I remember eating there once. but besides that, the film is quite entertaining about life and wanting to live inside the movies. Jeff Daniels does a superb job in making us believe that a movie character can leave the screen. Of course, we know it's not possible. Mia Farrow does a superb job in the role as Cecilia, the unhappy waitress and wife. The story was well-written but not Woody's genius.
