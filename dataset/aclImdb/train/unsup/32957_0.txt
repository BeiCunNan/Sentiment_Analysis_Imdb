Pathetic... Wearing the flag of Texas on their pathetic ''sheriff/deputy sheriff' shirts was a disgrace to not only Texas, but to the law enforcement community (The laws of the state of Texas/U.S.A. prevent all of the actions portrayed in the movie from happening... then again, it IS only a movie... but it went beyond the line).<br /><br />During (and after) watching the movie, I was much appalled by the Hollywood stereotype of Texans (we talk like hicks, rednecks, trailer trash, uneducated idiots)....<br /><br />I know Texas law, I was a deputy sheriff in the state of Texas.... The movie throws all of that out the window to make the impression that Texans are 'hillbillies' and uneducated trailer trash.<br /><br />The movie itself had no real storyline in it and seemed very hollow, and even if The Rock was in it, I don't think he could have helped the rating any at all.<br /><br />On on positive note (the only positive note for the movie), 1 person stands up to the 'bad' people...
