I watch a lot of movies, and this is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. The plot has everything to be desired. It delivers big for being a low budget movie. The writer/director is a breath of fresh air to an otherwise stale Hollywood scene. The story is new, and by far better than most of the blockbusters out on the big screen today. If you are looking for something different, then take a chance on this one. I know you'll be impressed. With the movies twists, and turns it will leave you glued to your seat waiting to see what happens next. The director will be around for a long time to come. I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.
