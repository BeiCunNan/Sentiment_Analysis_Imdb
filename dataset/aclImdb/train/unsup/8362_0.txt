In the same era of true family entertainment movies like The Apple Dumpling Gang and Cloak and Dagger, I grew up watching this movie over and over again. Since Don Knott's recent death and subsequent attention, it seemed this movie was never mentioned. For whatever reason, I think it's terrific. Classic slap-stick for those of us who miss the days of real comedic screenplay, and also zero special affects on a mediocre budget makes it all the more real. The music is perfect and the Biltmore grounds even more so. If watching Threes Company reruns aren't enough to get your Don Knotts dose, then this movie is for you. We miss you Don!
