Two rival ambulance companies battle to be the one that will remain in business when budget cuts strike the town. Its a low rent, low brow version of the Bill Cosby film Mother Juggs and Speed which had a similar plot line. What can I say about this film? Its not terrible, but then again its not terribly funny either. Everyone is drunk, stoned or sex crazed and the jokes sin out from there. There are jokes about the companies not wanting to pick anyone up, they pass accident scenes. Its a collection of half thought out jokes that the writers and director must have thought were going to work once they edited the film. Guess what most of them didn't. In fairness I laughed a couple of times, but I didn't really enjoy myself. If you must see this wait for cable.
