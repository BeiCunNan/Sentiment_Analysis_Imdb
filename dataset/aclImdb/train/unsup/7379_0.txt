Look at the number of film festival awards "The Fly Boys" has received. It is obvious that audiences connect with, and are entertained by, this movie. Why then have the studios taken a pass on distributing a film which, in my opinion, would not only be commercially successful, but critically praised as well? America is eager for this kind of family entertainment. I recently saw the movie at Bend Film 2008, where it won the Audience Award. It is well made, well written and well acted at a cost of only $2 million. While it might be better served with a few nips and tucks through editing and in structure, it is a hell of a ride for two hours and an incredible first time effort for its director. How rare it is to find an action movie with an interesting story and well drawn characters that have heart. You will find yourself laughing, crying, gasping and on the edge of your seat with action scenes that are truly breathtaking. It is a movie that both genders and all ages will find entertaining and heartwarming. I know...I know...these are descriptions that are an instant turn off to many cold hearted movie executives who are only looking for a return on their investment. I just don't understand why (other than the fact that it doesn't have major star power), the studio brass don't realize that it could be a major hit and enthusiastically received by movie audiences around the world who are hungry for this type of entertainment. What a pity! I feel fortunate to have seen "The Fly Boys" on the big screen. I only hope that you have the same chance.
