House of Luk is the 'tip of the iceberg' of great things to come from this Ottawa production house!<br /><br />This film takes an entertaining look at three unsuspecting characters' twists of fortune cookie fates. It's a good mix of fun, laughter and a few tears that leaves the viewer happily musing over one's own potential 'fortune cookie' read on life.<br /><br />The three separate stories thread themselves nicely through the film. Nuances of Canadian humour add an interesting flavour to the stories. There were some strong performances from the local talent. In particular, John Ng, the Feng Shui expert, was one of my favourites. I was impressed with the cinematography of this newly formed production house. The music chosen was excellent! In fact I craved for more of it through the quieter passages of the film. It's clear Distinct Features has the talent to make excellent films!! Watch as this will become one of this production house's early classics.<br /><br />All in all, it's a 'feel good and laugh' film. Go see it! It may influence your own fortune!
