I found the dialogue between David Hunter and Lynn ludicrous and her "I'm just a poor woman" act cringe-worthy. The performance by the actor playing Hunter was so over the top it was from another planet. SPOILER :<br /><br />So the police knew the Cloade house had been blown up by dynamite but there was no investigation? Please!! The only credit I give the production was to give Tim Pigot Smith so little to do. With an actor of his stature this nearly always means he would be the murderer. Not this time, so well done for that. Otherwise this production was so bad it makes me more annoyed the more I think of it. How can Suchet,supposedly, give approval for the book changes? I can only assume he does not appreciate the meaning of the title.
