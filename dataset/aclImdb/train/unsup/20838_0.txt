GamerZ tells the story of a D&D campaign and the relationships between its players. Its charm is multi-faceted, the idiosyncratic (and mostly very geeky) central characters are treated with a gently mocking affection, appealing both to roleplayers (who will have a whale of a time spotting the in-jokes and laughing at the stereotypes) and the general public. There are hidden treats in almost every minor role, generally superbly played, and the Glasgwegian setting is pitch-perfect, from the slang used to the contrasting influences in the main character's life. GamerZ is also technically interesting - rotoscoping (or 'shadowplay') techniques are used to evoke the fantasy game world the characters enter.<br /><br />All in all, a great laugh, and an excellent job in making a film about a minority interest appealing to the general public.
