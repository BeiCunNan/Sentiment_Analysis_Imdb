This came on TV late at night this week, and I didn't know a thing about it. That's the way I enjoy movies the most, and this one didn't disappoint. <br /><br />Although it's now more than 50 years old, it wouldn't take a lot of rewriting to remake it today. <br /><br />I only saw a couple of minor glitches, but they really don't take away much of the impact of the story.<br /><br />*** SPOILER WARNING ***<br /><br />*** SPOILER WARNING ***<br /><br />*** SPOILER WARNING ***<br /><br />This was pointed out by the host on Turner Classic movies: the scene where Georgia (Lana Turner) drives away from Jonathan Shields' house at night. There hasn't been a hint of any kind of outdoor weather in the whole movie, and then in this scene all of a sudden she's in a driving rainstorm.<br /><br />Next, as James Lee (Dick Powell) and Shields (Kirk Douglas) stop at a gas station at night on their way back to Hollywood, James Lee spots a newspaper with his wife's death reported on the front page. In the next scene, still at night, the two of them reach the accident scene, where he identifies her body. Now, how is it possible to publish a newspaper, for the paper to get delivered to a gas station, for somebody to see it, then to drive to the accident site, and the crash site looks like it happened minutes or hours ago???<br /><br />However, for every clinker scene like this, there were many others that made you think you were watching geniuses at work.<br /><br />Steven<br /><br />
