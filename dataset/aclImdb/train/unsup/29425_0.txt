I am a huge Antonio fan, Angelina I can take or leave, a bit of an over actor. but she fit this part well, her role was about an actress who used her acting skills to seduce unwitting men. so I guess it required a bit of mellow-drama. I found the plot twists to be very refreshing, you never quite knew where it was going and how it was going to end. for me the ending was not disappointing. I preferred to see them end up together and not living back on the plantation that he re-built from the ground up with his "honest" sweat and blood. I rather liked that they ended up together and living the bonnie and Clyde life style. it just seemed fitting to me. a happy ending, but not too happy. I give it a solid 8
