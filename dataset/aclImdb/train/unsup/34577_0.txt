What a dog this one is! Poorly staged action sequences, lousy acting, terrible dialogue - and it's racist to boot. A ridiculous simplification of the political turmoil in Lebanon in the 1980s, this film would also have us believe that one American high-school basketball coach can defeat a whole army of Lebanese terrorists!!! And we are also meant to believe that the US Government would recruit this same basketball coach (and his friendly Lebanese taxi driver!!!) in an operation to rescue American hostages - a four man operation against hundreds of armed-to-the-teeth terrorists. The resulting rescue scene is almost as funny as the opening scene of "The Naked Gun". This sort of nonsense certainly does nothing to help US relations with the Middle East - and, as this was an Israeli-American co-production, it does little to help Arab-Israeli relations either.<br /><br />On the plus side there is some excellent male eye-candy. Lorenzo Lamas, an even worse actor than his father (if such a thing is possible), is pretty easy on the eye. But even better we have no less than two Michael Pares - he plays twin brothers, and neither brother seems to be too fond of wearing shirts! It's a shame that Pare ended up in this sort of z-grade rubbish, particularly after such a promising start in "Eddie and the Cruisers".<br /><br />With the hunk factor so high, maybe you could watch "Killing Streets" with the sound turned down, put something sexy on the stereo, and simply admire the view!
