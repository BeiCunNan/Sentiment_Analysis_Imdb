I don't know what the hell is wrong with you people. This movie sucked. They said that Zenon would save the world. Did she? No. She just saved some aliens that were trapped. Sure, the aliens saved the space station, BUT THAT'S NOT SAVING THE WORLD!!!! There's absolutely no villain. Maggie's father isn't the villain. This movie is a major letdown from the first movie. Zenon's new parent actors don't help. STOP MAKING SUCH CRAPPY MOVIES, DISNEY!
