This was a very odd movie, it was a mix between Movie and porn.<br /><br />It was most likely Steven Baldwins worst film, I also noticed that One time Bond star George Lazenby had a small part in the film, I thought he did really well considering the type of movie it is.<br /><br />This is a movie that you could watch if you had Absulutely nothing else to watch, thats why I watched it.<br /><br />There where some very nice nude scenes however.<br /><br />Stephen Baldwin, What the hell are you doing? You use to do quality films, fire that agent of yours.<br /><br />go to your local video shop and you'll find this movie in the B-grade waste of time section, it should be right next to Gladiator or some other crappy Russel Crowe Movie.
