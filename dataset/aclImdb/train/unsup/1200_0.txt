Possibly the big attraction to this film would be the appearance of Brigitte Nielsen, or Danny Fendley who plays the role of Rick Stone and is married to Brigitte (Michelle). There is a reporter on a local tabloid newspaper who manages to photograph Rick in bed with a hot gal completely naked. Naturally, Michelle wants a divorce and also every penny that Rich Stone owns. As the film progresses there are lots of naked sex scenes and that is about all this film has to offer, the acting is a disgrace and this really is the type of film production a porno studio would use as a story line and then of course the love making. If you like nudity, this film might interest you.
