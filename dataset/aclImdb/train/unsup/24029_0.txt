I remember the 1971 version of "Get Carter", well this version of it I would say I like the best. At both versions have one thing in common, Michael Caine. Unlike the first one, Sly Stallone is the main character, Jack Carter. His look for the movie is way cool, and I like the way he handled things. When the details were of the underground world, no one handles the problems the way Carter does. There's plenty of car chases, shooting, and of course killing some, Carter does all that. In this version of the movie Michael Caine plays the character Cliff Brumby. I think it's fair enough that the original star should have his place in a remake. I know why the critics put down this movie so hard. To me, I wouldn't let get to me, for the way I see it, I enjoyed it very well. Making the promises is always something for everyone to keep, Carter doesn't back out or down to anything. This is one remake I think is very good, I see what I like, and everything else is good entertainment. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
