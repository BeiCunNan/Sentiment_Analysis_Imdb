I have to say that I agree with most of the comments of the previous reviewer. It is one of the most emotional Bollywood films I've ever seen. I wept like a small child and even felt compelled to write this review, my first.<br /><br />Kal Ho Naa Ho is really Shah Rukh at his finest. I notice that Kareena Kapoor was originally offered the role of Naina and I must say that I am glad she asked for too much money because Preity Zinta completely changed my impression of her with this film. She displayed much acting talent in a complex role and is no longer "the annoying girl from the Liril ads" to me.<br /><br />This is very much like an Indian remake of "Autumn in New York", though, and despite knowing this I was not prepared for the conclusion. If you just like singing, dancing and happy Bollywood I'm not sure this one is for you. But, if you are looking for a plot and character-driven Indian film, I completely recommend this one. Get a nice warm blanket and a box of tissues ready though.
