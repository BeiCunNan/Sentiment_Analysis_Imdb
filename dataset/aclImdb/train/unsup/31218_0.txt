This is the way I figure it. This movie is made to be like what people would assume a realistic abduction tape would be like. If you were to find a real tape containing footage of aliens invading someone's home and eventually abducting them, this is the way the director thinks that tape would play like.<br /><br />It's not a real documentary, but a movie made about what a documentary on this topic would be like.<br /><br />Get it? Anyway, I really liked it. I saw it 8 years ago when I was 10 and now I am finally seeing it again now that I can understand that it's fake. I mean, the oldest brother is from the movie Wrongfully Accused. :P The cameraman acts exactly the way I would've acted if I had a camera during that particular situation. I would never want to miss a beat because I would know that my footage could possibly change the way the people of our world think about life in our universe. The people asking him to turn off the camera were being irrational and selfish.<br /><br />The effects (though cheap) are effective in that they get the job done. You know it's a ray gun as soon as you see it. The ball of light worked just fine imo. Many people say "oh but it didn't reflect or reveal any shadows". All I have to say to this is that the beings that created the light are not from our planet, and perhaps this planets rules of light does not apply to everything they have.<br /><br />The ending was great, it really tied the whole thing together.<br /><br />Anyway I am terrible at reviews but I am giving this a 7 out of 10. The only reason it's not getting an 8+ is because the dialogue is a bit cheesy at times, and the reactions are a bit clich√©'.
