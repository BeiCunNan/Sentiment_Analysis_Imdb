As a senior at a college in northeastern Pennsylvania, I accepted the opportunity to be an "extra" in a movie being shot in Honesdale, PA. Well, guess which movie it was - you got it - "Playing for Keeps"! I don't think I've told anyone I was ever in it (except my wife) as I'm sure I don't want them seeing it! We spent the day there - mostly outside in the cold, and shot 1 scene - the final scene where the guy comes back from jail - for the night. I thought I performed well, and am still waiting for my credit! (And the lunch that was promised!) Was a fun experience - haven't seen it in years - guess I've gotta get a copy! Actually don't remember seeing Marisa, but do remember hanging around with some of the other cast members during the unbelievably long down-time. Guess that's why they call it work...
