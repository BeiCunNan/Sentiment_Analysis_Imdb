This is a great comedy. If you liked to watch Saturday Night Live back in 93 than you will simply love this. The story is about two aliens who were going to attack Earth but the mission went wrong. When they crash land in a lake and get out of the lake they go to a motel to spend the night. They come to the conclusion to blend in with the blood skulls (humans) and to ask for a rescue ship as soon as they get the supplies they need. Veldar (Aykroyd) immediately gets a job working for Otto (Sinbad). When the Coneheads have the proper equipment they build it all up and it works. However when they contact their commander the news is not good. He says he can arrange a rescue ship in maybe 7 years but maybe longer than even that. So the Coneheads decide that they are going to have to blend in longer than they expected. Eventually Mrs. Conehead has a daughter, Connie (Burke) and they try to live a normal life on earth. The life they try to lead however is anything but normal and they are doing things ordinary people would not do. Chris Farley is very funny also as Connie's boyfriend Ronnie and he really is good in his part. The Saturday Night live people who appear in this movie are: Adam Sandler (Who is also very good in his part as a guy who gives Veldar his new identity when Veldar is discovered by Otto as being an "illegal alien".),Chris Farley(I've already told you about him), Dan Aykroyd, and Jane Curtin. Some other cameos are by Jon Lovitz,(as a dentist) Drew Carey (as a taxi passenger),Jason Alexander (as the Coneheads neighbor), and David Spade (as an FBI agent).<br /><br />*** out of ****
