Yeah, i think that subject line pretty much says it all. I am not usually one to post comments on a movie but this one was so bad, I just had to make an exception. So badly acted and badly written that everyone involved in its making ought to be ashamed of themselves. The only reason I continued watching it was because I was so amazed at how bad it was and was convinced it couldn't possibly get any worse. Boy, was i wrong. It eventually deteriorated into a bad Sister Act 2 remake. Characters so one-dimensional and annoying, you are almost yelling at them to get the hell off your screen. Positive images of African-Americans? Yeah right. The girl is a vapid, spoiled brat who is not going to graduate from college, and heavens forbid the son actually want to be in college as opposed to pursuing a music career. I was insulted by it. I wish for no one to see this movie. Save yourself.
