just watched this movie...and i can surely say this is my favorite movie.<br /><br />It will take you through the journey of Joshua.. a mission he has embarked upon...to find God so that he can make sure his Grandpa is okay in heaven.<br /><br />It is more than a movie to me.I could really relate to Joshua as i also used to think a lot about God at that age partly because i was born in a very religious family.The feelings Joshua goes through in his search for god and how it changes him to a certain extent for eg, when Freddie Waltman-a boy who has bullied Joshua since 3rd grade has to leave school...instead of feeling happy he feels really sad for him... have been narrated on screen beyond words...only a genius could have achieved this.<br /><br />Anyone who has taste for good cinema...watch this..I'm sure it will become your fav too!!:)
