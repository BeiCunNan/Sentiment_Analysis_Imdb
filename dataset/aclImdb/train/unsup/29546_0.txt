I've always loved this above average lost in jungle comedy team movie. This movie showcases Mitchell and Petrillo and for the life of me i don't know why they were not more popular.Being clones of Martin and Lewis,they come off as quite professional in this B- Movie.Songs are good and i like this movie better than any "road" movies but then thats a matter of taste or lack of it.Bela Lugosi and the Ape actors just add to the fun.1 scene that cracks me up is the witch doctor eating a banana through his giant mask.Then again Sammy doing stand up to the natives who seem Hawaiian gets me going too.The question is did Mitchell and Petrillo make more movies?
