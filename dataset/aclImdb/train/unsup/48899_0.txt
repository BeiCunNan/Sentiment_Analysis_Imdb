it starting off okay, but it seemed like the film had an identity crisis for the most part. i suspect that they ran out of money when they were filming and just went with what they had. a big disappointment from tamara davis (although not as big as finding out that she directed a b.spears film - what did mike d think about that?)<br /><br />2/10
