I saw a preview of Word Play. From some of the PR, I thought it was some sort of thriller, but actually it was a documentary about people who do the New York Times crossword puzzle (well actually crossword puzzles in general but the NYT puzzle seems to be the creme de la creme). and it turned out to be a thriller of sorts! This was a very good movie! Anyone who has ever pulled their hair out over some of the clues in the NYT crossword will enjoy this movie, and be impressed by the puzzle solvers.<br /><br />Jon Stewart is on hand to provide comic relief.<br /><br />The movie covers just about everything you ever (or never) wanted to know about crossword puzzles, including bits of history and how the puzzles are made.<br /><br />The central theme of the movie is a crossword puzzle convention and competition. We go behind the scenes and meet Will Shortz, the NYT crossword puzzle editor, along with several of the contestants and crossword puzzle writers.<br /><br />who'da thunk Bill Clinton, Jon Stewart, the Indigo Girls, Mike Mussina (pitcher with the Yankees), and Ken Burns (documentary film maker) would share a love of the NYT crossword? This was a very enjoyable movie, and well worth the price of admission.
