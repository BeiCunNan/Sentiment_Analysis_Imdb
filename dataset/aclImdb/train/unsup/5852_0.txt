This is the only film I have given a 10 on this site. I find this movie fascinating and brilliantly portrayed by Mr. Duvall. He deserved an Oscar for this performance. Living in Texas (where the first part of the film is set) I know that the preaching he does in this movie seems as real as a Texas outdoor revival! He is a troubled man to be sure, but his character lifts all of us up with each step of the way in the movie. Farrah Fawcett plays a good part opposite him as his wife and the movie seems to split apart in the middle then pulls itself right back together again as Duvall commands the part. I can watch this over and over and still find parts which I love. It is like reading a spiritual book over and over and finding something better about it. I have recommended this to my friends to watch as I have only seen it this year (2006). A fine character study of a flawed man and his obsession with religion at any cost. Be sure to catch it.
