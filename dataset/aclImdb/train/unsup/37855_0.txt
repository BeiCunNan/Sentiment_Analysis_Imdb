loved him in Hard Target......did not see enough of him in this particular movie though......he really is a sexy talented actor...was disappointed...if ya got it strut it.....and he definitely has got it! i liked the storyline of the movie but it was very hard to see Arnold....as a BIG fan of his he should of been in more of the storyline and i can see why the female in the movie did what she did he does have a very very sexy voice.....i agree with the other viewer someone should write a role for Arnold quick, one that shows his obvious talents...laughing..that's all i can think of to say on the subject. thank you for your time.
