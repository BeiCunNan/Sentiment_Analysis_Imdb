First line to pad out the comment.<br /><br />Second line to pad out the comment. Review follows!<br /><br />I remember this being my least watched of the four Peanuts movies. Returning to this film after twenty years to watch it with my three year old daughter reminded me why that was.<br /><br />Either people are hurting each other or they're crying in this film. The voice acting is generally bad, though Linus is pretty good. Charlie Brown is just about intolerable. At one point, my daughter turned to me and said, "Daddy, this is boring." She was right.<br /><br />I'm glad I showed her this one first. They only get better.
