I will use a Adam Sandler line to explain how I hated this film. In the same voice and tone as Adam did in Mr Deeds. You sick you sick. How could you? Again, your sick your sick how could? How could you make such a bad film. The movie has crotch style jokes. Sometimes and I say maybe sometimes such a joke is funny the first time, but not a entire movie. Again you sick you sick how could you Adam? The preview shows the few funny parts, and the real joke is on us the viewer spending $9 dollars on Sandlers latest production. Makes the infamous Weekend at Burnies look like the classic Groundhog day or Caddy Shack. I give this film a one. Run do not walk. Run run away fast from this film.
