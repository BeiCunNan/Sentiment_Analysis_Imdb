1 word- FABULOUS. not your average movie at all! Razzle Dazzle is an Australian based movie but a fake documentary. It is so full of unexpected jokes and wise cracks. i found it wonderful.<br /><br />Only 1 thing some people i complained about was the fuzziness in the beginning. I think it was just a bit of an affect and made no damage to the movie. Ben Miller is great in this movie but it was Kerry Armstrongs act as a pushy stage mother that had me in tears. She is just so into her character in the movie. She tries to make her daughter seem the best in front of others and tells her off for each little mistake. What i found most funny was the fact she took her daughter in for a nose job (which of course didn't happen) and complained how she might end up with her fathers nose. <br /><br />Though the concept of the movie is based on what happens in the homes and studios of the children, the main focus is the competition. They compete in a style of dance telling a story.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for people whom enjoy dancing and comedies.
