This is a Great Movie which I got to see in 1990 from a Laser disc we rented.<br /><br />This also gives us an idea about the origins of Snoopy and his original owner Leila.<br /><br />The soundtrack is also great.<br /><br />I watched this movie with my niece and nephew who enjoyed it much as I did back then.<br /><br />I liked the part when Charlie Brown said "It took that rock 5,000 years to come to shore, now your putting it back".<br /><br />This is a movie which can be enjoyed by the family.<br /><br />It takes me to an earlier time of innocence.<br /><br />I wish things were a lot simpler now as it was then.
