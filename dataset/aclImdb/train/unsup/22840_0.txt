I am a huge fan of movies and TV programmes. This like many other DVD's i buy went straight back to the shop. I haven't seen the film in a while (that is a good thing) but can remember the basic outline of the plot and story. A top secret DNA experiment on a rare breed of spider goes horrifically wrong as a freak meteor shower engulfs a NASA shuttle on a deep space mission. Tragedy hits the doomed space-craft as it is re-directed to a secret location in the heart of the California desert. The only survivor has been inpregnated with the venom of a rogue killer spider (sounds exciting to say the least) In the depths of a secret underground base another killer spider hatches from the body of the space shuttle survivor (WOW). An X-Files-style conspiracy creates and unleashes murderous mutant spiders feeding on their victims and growing in size after each kill. Mayhem ensues as a giant killer spider stomps through the streets of LA (as always)! Ridiculous from the start and very boring overall. The cheesiest part is where the two last friends are caught in a giant web in a elevator shaft and a spider comes running down the wall, if you see the sequel, this shot is used again. The boy lets his friend survive by making the spider in some way go for him. In LA the spider gets bigger and the special effects literally bomb. It looks as if they have followed a spider round with a video camera and got some dud idiot to blow it up. They eventually kill it by shooting it in the mouth. BORING the film went straight back to the shop. Hated it from the opening titles through to the dismal end. The plot, effects and seriously bad acting are'nt even laughable i would give this film a 0/10 if possible, don't waste time buying this film because you WILL take it back<br /><br />thank you, stephenquinn
