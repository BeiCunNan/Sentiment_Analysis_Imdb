This film, unlike it's sequel, is a masterpiece. I grew up with this movie, It was one of my first theatre-going experiences as a child, This film unfortunately has never been given the credit it deserves. This film that has such a deep meaning to society has been all but forgotten. The animation is about the quality of that that Disney was turning out in the mid-80's, but the purpose behind the movie is what is so great, this movie that was concieved to sell toys actually conveys a sense of morality to its audience.<br /><br />The music is wonderful, John Sebastian and Carole King did a wonderful job. Before long, you'll find yourself singing along with the songs. The comical lines in this film are far better than those in the sequel, the humour is actually funny. Whether you're six years old or twenty-five, this is a very enjoyable movie, and hopefully it will reappear on video again soon, because a virtuous film like this should be readily available to everyone.
