this was shown once on TV,it was supposed to be a new series based on the destroyer series and it never made it past the pilot episode.i was disappointed that it didn't follow the books as close as it could have. Roddy McDowell did a good job as Chuin,he was a lot more believable than Jeffrey Meek as Remo.i think a different actor in the lead role would have made the difference in the show.if this had better previews with an explanation of its origin it might have stood a chance.would like to see this remade today,with a believable cast. this has so much potential for a TV series and with 139 (and counting!)books it could have a long life with the right people behind it.
