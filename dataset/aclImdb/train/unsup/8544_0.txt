I just read the prior similarly titled review and disagree with that opinion. This was a very interesting and entertaining movie, but should have been titled burn BEFORE reading for a different reason. The lack of communication between most of the characters is impressive and leads to many of plot twists in the movie. This is especially evident in the CIA's handling of the fallout from the firing of their analyst. This leads to a cascade of events which make up the bulk of the movie. The interpersonal dishonesty between most of the characters further complicates this leads to a very complex turn of events. Overall this is what makes the movie a complex collage of darkly humorous events that the Coen brothers have been known for. This is done without repetitive plot forms. Overall I enjoyed viewing the movie and would recommend the movie for at least a rental, and a possible purchase for true Coen brothers aficionado's.
