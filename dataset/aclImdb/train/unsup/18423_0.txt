I found this movie absolutely arresting and poetic. The shots were beautiful and the characters serene. The dialect was so well orated by the actors. Tapas Paul is such a good actor. And its brave of him to experiment with such artsy films despite his urban star status. <br /><br />Being away from my own home, I can relate to the importance of letters which later became phone calls and now emails. <br /><br />Dasgupta is a class act and I love the way he picturizes his films and tells his stories. Its so beautiful and there is so much depth into the stories. <br /><br />I wish to see more such films from our contemporary Bengali filmmakers because we are not really only pop culture. <br /><br />Granted it could be slow for people who are used to the commercial cinema and Bollywood but this is a must see for all art lovers.
