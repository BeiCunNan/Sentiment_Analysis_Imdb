I watched this one despite the generally low scores, and for once Im siding with the negative reviews. People have mentioned the barrage of flashbacks in the first twenty minutes, I was dumbfounded. I couldn't figure what possible purpose they served, other than padding out the running time and driving the audience mad. The acting and characterisations were all pretty terrible, with the so called heroes mostly being obnoxious and the mutants being virtually comedy characters. There's almost no gore or suspense, even the bits that should be exciting never really pay off in a worth while way, and the few good ideas in the movie (traps and some cool locations) are pretty much squandered. The potentially cool bits are the only saving grace of this one, but its still about 95 plus percent useless so Id say avoid.
