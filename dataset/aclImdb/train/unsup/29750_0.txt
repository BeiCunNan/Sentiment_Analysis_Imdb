this is an erotic but unpretentious x movie. exotic locations, great music, beautiful costumes and the debut of then 22 years old sylvia krystel pursuing sex joy before the dawn of aids fear. need to say more? a real classic that has stand the test of time. no wonder it has been shown in french cinema for 10 years and still shown in film festivals. it is also exported to 86 countries, sold more copies than "titanic". just watch and admire. they don't make such decent x movie anymore.<br /><br />
