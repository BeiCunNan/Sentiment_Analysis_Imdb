Upfront, I must admit that I watched only the first 30 minutes of this film. Only because I couldn't bear to waste another hour or more on it. I don't have a problem with the hackneyed premise--many good films have come from bog-standard scenarios before, but the characters are no more than clownish caricatures, the dialogue painfully unfunny, and the acting is hammy and highly overperfomed (perhaps in a vain effort to make the dialogue funnier.) Not being familiar with the actors, who may very well have been brilliant in everything else they've ever been in, this may well be the director's fault. "The Wild Guys" may have been a very successful and funny stage play, but this movie fails on every level. Zero stars.
