Okay, if this contains any spoilers at all they won't be too extensive since I have to admit that I could only stomach just over 30 minutes of this dross. The first 20 minutes plays out like a weakly dramatised infomercial on the dangers of drink driving, the two characters we have a handle on by this time are about as deep as a cookie tray, seem to have an almost fatal case of the clich√©s and just as "she" confesses to "he" that she was responsible for her best friend's (and his girl friend's) death - what do they do? They jump into the sack for some well covered soft core, that's what! - the creature is basically introduced as someone with a breathing problem running around with a shaky camera, hiding in the scrub and generally exuding bad attitude... when it gives our "heroes" a scare naturally they reach for the bottle of booze. At this point I switched off and for a few seconds I thought about making it my purpose in life to warn everyone off buying or renting this movie - I gave it a rating of 1 for the nice forest scenery and the silly parrot with the fake voice. Avoid!
