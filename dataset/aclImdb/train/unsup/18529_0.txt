I didn't expect much, or even ask much, from Sci-Fi Channel movies. And I mostly like them. But the only thing that was worse than the script and acting in this stinker was the effects.<br /><br />It was nice to see Kelly McGillis again, although her role was so thinly written it was painful to watch. The no-names show why they will almost certainly remain so.<br /><br />The story, which had potential, was leaden with bland, uninspired dialog, and porno-logic behavior. You simply didn't buy these character, or care what happened to them.<br /><br />Where's Stephen Baldwin when you need him!?!?<br /><br />The scenery was nice, though.
